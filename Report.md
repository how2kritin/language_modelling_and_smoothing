# Generation - Analysis

## Task-1

### Using the generated N-gram models (without the smoothing techniques), try generating sequences. Experiment with different values of N and report which models perform better in terms of fluency.

## Task-2

### Attempt to generate a sentence using an Out-of-Data (OOD) scenario with your N-gram models. Analyze and discuss the behavior of N-gram models in OOD contexts.

## Task-3

### Now try to generate text using the models with the smoothing techniques (LM1, LM2, LM3, LM4, LM5, LM6) for N=1,3 and 5 each.
