"But it is,"returned she;"for Mrs.	9.936806976978787
Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."Mr. Bennet made no answer.	3.505802295923208
What a fine thing for our girls!""How so?	2.96450029870691
When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.""In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.""But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.""It is more than I engage for, I assure you.""But consider your daughters.	2.015752367123821
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.""I desire you will do no such thing.	1.89663340118294
You have no compassion on my poor nerves.""You mistake me, my dear.	2.9611058207795797
They are my old friends.	7.461838118630906
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.	3.236803499232793
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.	3.4358116699964785
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."The girls stared at their father.	1.6052450362775368
"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?	4.032399080720406
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	5.886177162466922
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.	5.518673082088737
Not all that Mrs.	7.003547152524555
They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.	1.3490117236097423
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	1.8328984582974004
Bennet was quite disconcerted.	54.35211036041496
And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.	1.8380186454265552
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.	1.095039506288279
You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.	3.328743239789146
"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable.	2.216983258346782
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.	2.0547491341874236
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	1.5630019956389836
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.	1.6208071647072484
I wish you had been there.	42.28806119132238
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	3.2942425308680408
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.	1.8607742797561644
Bennet,"I am quite delighted with him.	35.03299117163598
I did not expect such a compliment.""Did not you?	5.362516033271584
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.	1.3915697705498504
They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	1.8646411672053544
They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.	1.3966594672732173
He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	1.6260435547541758
In understanding Darcy was the superior.	3.90347549942081
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	6.736978284312459
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.	2.005581422548325
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so - - but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.	2.0902990292332753
"_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.""Yes; - - but he seemed to like his second better.""Oh! - - you mean Jane, I suppose - - because he danced with her twice.	3.257592345455508
With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable.""I do not believe a word of it, my dear.	4.023379569952341
But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs.	2.322754374921556
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.""I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.	2.9330275433569564
Long,"said Miss Lucas,"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.""Another time, Lizzy,"said her mother,"I would not dance with _him_, if I were you.""I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.""His pride,"said Miss Lucas,"does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.	2.321655154205888
A person may be proud without being vain.	3.2283013331543495
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,"cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters,"I should not care how proud I was.	1.8444955376674474
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest.	2.0962088900505997
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.	3.3869822902625284
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.	1.3964404989115264
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.""But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	1.5081851429550317
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.""Not as you represent it.	2.5434193800608593
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together - - and four evenings may do a great deal.""Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.""Well,"said Charlotte,"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to - morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.	1.406992048803982
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	1.095039506288279
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	1.4566668805140666
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.	1.4465675868101682
"Your friend performs delightfully;"he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; - -"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.""You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir.""Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	2.6263769832788495
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	2.1371005044412965
"He is indeed - - but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	2.029421049009088
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.""Miss Elizabeth Bennet!"repeated Miss Bingley.	2.087552910345206
"I am all astonishment.	43.15613074311752
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.	1.5742077434297992
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,"Well, Jane, who is it from?	3.1327199784147495
what is it about?	12.943057665106998
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	2.4221131876723088
Bennet,"that is very unlucky.""Can I have the carriage?"said Jane.	6.408937237563667
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.""That would be a good scheme,"said Elizabeth,"if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.""Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.""I had much rather go in the coach.""But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.	2.626619325411255
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:"My dearest Lizzy,"I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	1.1512681962937603
People do not die of little trifling colds.	4.8194119118328
"How can you be so silly,"cried her mother,"as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.""I shall be very fit to see Jane - - which is all I want.""Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,"said her father,"to send for the horses?""No, indeed.	2.1142011500461333
I shall be back by dinner.""I admire the activity of your benevolence,"observed Mary,"but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.""We will go as far as Meryton with you,"said Catherine and Lydia. - - Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.	1.6685839573616752
"If we make haste,"said Lydia, as they walked along,"perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers'wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.	1.474848767133285
She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. - - Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.	1.988766609747624
Elizabeth silently attended her.	5.561024510844532
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.	1.5992160567320668
Hurst thought the same, and added,"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.	1.6446443336930947
She really looked almost wild.""She did indeed, Louisa.	1.9870653847981028
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.	1.9656396096247368
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum.""It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,"said Bingley.	1.6003807389441829
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.	1.6236461960854562
On entering the drawing - room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.	1.6060560550912395
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else.""I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,"cried Elizabeth;"I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.""In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,"said Bingley;"and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.	1.6141966934488328
He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.	2.026460281141682
"I am astonished,"said Miss Bingley,"that my father should have left so small a collection of books. - - What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!""It ought to be good,"he replied,"it has been the work of many generations.""And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.""I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.""Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.	1.9822219951864546
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.""Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,"said Darcy,"has too much truth.	1.6164185224649088
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.	2.8780305575582967
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.	2.1748652222023415
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.	2.039539350481566
"Indeed I have, Sir,"was her answer.	8.161274252154467
Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.	2.7827490952885987
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	10.970887772363382
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.	8.630919683094914
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.""That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,"said Elizabeth.	3.487189378112214
It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.""Lizzy,"cried her mother,"remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.""I did not know before,"continued Bingley immediately,"that you were a studier of character.	2.0417868484496213
They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.""Aye - - that is because you have the right disposition.	2.42458122676625
I know we dine with four and twenty families."Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.	2.2321638373511425
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.	1.7798426113035504
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.	15.994181998403546
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	1.682914810188016
But however he did not.	3.9899116999028323
Every thing nourishes what is strong already.	5.382736547970539
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.	1.7271333611623398
Lydia was a stout, well - grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.	1.5574347992654693
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."Lydia declared herself satisfied.	3.2256086558806873
"Oh! yes - - it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.	3.0498954324531744
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."Mrs.	3.365534123917058
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.	2.0643471016320647
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"He made no answer.	3.974505923086606
Let me mend it for you.	5.882156611097752
I shall see her in January.	10.068536693343118
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself.""I am exceedingly gratified,"said Bingley,"by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	2.6122162228278443
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.	2.6822755437275836
"I see your design, Bingley,"said his friend. - -"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.""Perhaps I do.	3.447740841772116
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano - forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.	2.0135255397154688
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.	1.7684112199421185
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all - - and now despise me if you dare.""Indeed I do not dare."Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	1.4382925893083878
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?""It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye - lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.	1.3098293539169392
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	2.2984234081187838
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.	3.1399165876426465
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire - place, that she might be farther from the door.	1.9295565593647865
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	3.426600659045027
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.	2.391334687320201
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table - - but in vain.	2.474840455646035
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.	2.0458337053589117
Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.	2.528228477661974
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.	2.05820177633755
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	2.0288610381118244
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said,"How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! - - When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."No one made any reply.	1.3486753314973923
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.""Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.	2.0929979759373
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"- - and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?	1.095039506288279
"Not at all,"was her answer;"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it."Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.	2.081980882448866
"You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; - - if the first, I should be completely in your way; - - and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.""Oh! shocking!"cried Miss Bingley.	1.505419294686588
"I never heard any thing so abominable.	10.448769970036862
The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.""Certainly,"replied Elizabeth - -"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.	1.4839366253922168
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. - - But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.""Perhaps that is not possible for any one.	1.095039506288279
He owns it himself without disguise.""No"- - said Darcy,"I have made no such pretension.	1.8563395003596517
My temper would perhaps be called resentful. - - My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.""_That_ is a failing indeed!"- - cried Elizabeth.	2.5652628081977213
"Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.	3.8132897582903738
Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.	2.6853254221803713
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	1.3820086244523033
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	2.727684035819415
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	1.147814493466309
I do not believe she often sees such at home.""The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."Mrs.	2.2581045244247964
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	1.7167623289891603
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,"said Mr. Bennet,"and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.	3.1859965811802486
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November <NUM> th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.	1.3590301850149933
"He must be an oddity, I think,"said she.	6.126704354717168
"I cannot make him out. - - There is something very pompous in his style. - - And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? - - We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. - - Can he be a sensible man, sir?""No, my dear; I think not.	1.8320652699197408
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.	4.695285492055265
I am impatient to see him.""In point of composition,"said Mary,"his letter does not seem defective.	2.060796334849446
Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	2.4074217159427187
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs.	2.2621691551300964
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	2.4806433588609034
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.	2.70401337687946
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.	1.9009574977302384
Bennet,"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	11.559374482725278
Bennet, shaking her head,"then she is better off than many girls.	3.166898305772932
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. - - These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.""You judge very properly,"said Mr. Bennet,"and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	1.4332833983562416
By tea - time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	2.0671819729013983
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.	1.7608296036825242
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	1.8677614805914073
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.	1.799121205716097
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman - like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.	1.7127506276190263
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.	2.04720295774061
On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.	1.7521830455062561
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.	2.8780305575582967
Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	1.482602335800963
Philips'throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.	4.971636143546787
She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.	1.2882697160938568
She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become"stupid, disagreeable fellows."Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.	1.4566907441263217
This was agreed to, and Mrs.	6.5648922064322015
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	1.7009872500997285
The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	5.144412199794921
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.	1.6428687117191472
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.	1.1814099409340266
She dared not even mention that gentleman.	22.05763333739529
Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.	13.46290497643309
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.	1.5777320887754198
"About a month,"said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added,"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.""Yes,"replied Wickham; - -"his estate there is a noble one.	3.2022052128773564
It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.	33.428302531921055
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.""I cannot pretend to be sorry,"said Wickham, after a short interruption,"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.	2.0768748233868437
We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	1.536497795932471
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.	1.9403095448091725
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	1.2874994686706855
I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.	1.9522355233925976
I _must_ have employment and society.	3.266963118052798
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	3.2144583227340893
I cannot do justice to his kindness.	10.268695163229067
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.	2.836173308430744
His disposition must be dreadful.""I will not trust myself on the subject,"replied Wickham,"_I_ can hardly be just to him."Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,"To treat in such a manner, the god - son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"- - She could have added,"A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"- - but she contented herself with"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!""We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	1.1816630636910916
Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself.""How strange!"cried Elizabeth.	1.608732539697405
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	5.836115677334047
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride.""Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?""Yes.	1.7327341502725362
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.	1.095039506288279
She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.	3.4059983178136677
Philips. - - The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.	2.0187583231662662
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self - destined to another.	1.8795657287039604
She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.	2.3171927929040756
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.	1.430569410890545
"They have both,"said she,"been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.	3.541091639827933
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.	1.533540907307998
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.	1.9919683787008742
They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.	1.6550486975110927
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's looks and behaviour.	1.6829296069461368
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.	3.5115598022907317
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,"said he,"that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, - - a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	1.6909697030939508
There was no help for it however.	6.727161660644565
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys'invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. - - Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.	1.242947519865234
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.	1.8839755433795944
Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.	1.8352152498536236
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. - - _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.""I must not decide on my own performance."He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.	1.9336835609501875
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.	1.6318811780812814
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.	10.27890391010182
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.	1.813527738180066
What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy: - - but let me not interrupt you, Sir. - - You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.	1.2204695780857202
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. - - We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.""What think you of books?"said he, smiling.	1.5424133956925046
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_.""I am,"said he, with a firm voice.	3.6643839431109635
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?""I hope not.""It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.""May I ask to what these questions tend?""Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,"said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.	1.6098035511771853
"I am trying to make it out.""And what is your success?"She shook her head.	5.436138615442458
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.""I can readily believe,"answered he gravely,"that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.""But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.""I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,"he coldly replied.	1.6049594191993886
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! - - Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.	1.4980990254707562
I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.	1.752525303603473
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy."She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.	2.716808235978356
But what does he say of the living?""He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.""I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,"said Elizabeth warmly;"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	1.6524156198192097
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	4.289190830679776
"I have no reason, I assure you,"said he,"to be dissatisfied with my reception.	6.252843784610848
It was really a very handsome thought.	8.130063264979691
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self - gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.	1.2811012358798084
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	6.137776548474852
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	3.824717710625421
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.	1.8131700903212622
You have delighted us long enough.	11.627520688529769
I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family."And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. - - Many stared. - - Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half - whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	1.3848245693783976
That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	1.7365588702787367
She was teazed by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.	2.652934215818656
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	2.018408296599254
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	1.7723068819908194
Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	3.5251615178848263
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.	2.656872468875618
Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.	1.5231063927894204
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months.	1.5952459943021564
Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	3.506256467841142
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.	1.4323282032554214
A clergyman like you must marry. - - Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.	1.342836222518505
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.	1.7164904862128478
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the <NUM> per cents.	1.3966994276850773
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	1.095039506288279
"You forget that I have made no answer.	11.22544832112158
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them.""I am not now to learn,"replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand,"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.	2.2331034606235898
I am perfectly serious in my refusal. - - You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so. - - Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.""Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,"said Mr. Collins very gravely - -"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.	1.687362338762271
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.""Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	1.9788435229021775
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	2.4259046606883703
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.""I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	1.5636084308673783
Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	1.4071007972647502
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_."Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.	1.7766424028944938
"Come here, child,"cried her father as she appeared.	8.173697219189776
I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.	2.294830145981286
Bennet give up the point.	4.250682828598176
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,"she added in a melancholy tone,"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.	1.977076155822411
Bennet,"looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. - - But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all - - and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. - - _I_ shall not be able to keep you - - and so I warn you. - - I have done with you from this very day. - - I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.	1.6332792183749365
Nobody can tell what I suffer! - - But it is always so.	3.3369483201901966
Far be it from me,"he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure,"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	1.295497659196035
Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	4.112482194686851
"I found,"said he,"as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; - - that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	1.500268995170482
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.	4.145404108509757
I depend on you for that."To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	1.411334759763054
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair.	1.8136357195509207
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you.""It is evident by this,"added Jane,"that he comes back no more this winter.""It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.""Why will you think so?	1.3060876406003459
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.	1.2899465012632183
Believe her to be deceived by all means.	1.3856047725822136
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.""But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?""You must decide for yourself,"said Elizabeth,"and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.""How can you talk so?"- - said Jane faintly smiling, - -"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.""I did not think you would; - - and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.""But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.	1.688468840471987
They agreed that Mrs.	5.610733247123441
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	10.181111502149031
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.	1.435212942856096
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.	1.7214927575378736
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.	1.3759576799111595
Her reflections were in general satisfactory.	3.8958969585462344
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	1.3625555478586533
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.""Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.	1.2031329498576844
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.	3.9085609126149996
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	3.3548428924526683
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, - - impossible!"The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? - - Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.	1.4554253690630958
The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.	2.5000388349799154
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.	1.6222863036256994
With many compliments to them, and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter, - - to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.	1.5021902784099115
Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? - - Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.	1.5041661211281456
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.	1.392428682040307
The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	1.4572569150810406
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. - - It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. - - She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.	1.4936888978872735
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	4.211998472455525
Even Elizabeth began to fear - - not that Bingley was indifferent - - but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	2.3123438461496253
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.	1.3524084410645625
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.	1.4740753152716586
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.	1.9004950444923265
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	2.2110083699228817
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.	2.4992388111644734
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	2.4678277188866464
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."This was not very consoling to Mrs.	2.47538586402657
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.	3.2453001475332313
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.	1.3378126820553216
He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.	1.9552287137573046
"You doubt me,"cried Jane, slightly colouring;"indeed you have no reason.	3.5014718985123534
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.	1.3553672774309071
_I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	2.592323338128766
It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!""My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	3.303980679250823
They will ruin your happiness.	12.620524754036365
My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow - minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	2.1706950893734027
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.	3.9022385964565327
Women fancy admiration means more than it does.""And men take care that they should.""If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.""I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,"said Elizabeth;"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	1.5044146938911351
Do not distress me by the idea.	5.01892559870288
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	3.5929612480057527
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.""Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	2.4377683090626463
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.	2.3700395354269697
They are all for what they can get.	4.195860226086169
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.	1.4966171866534375
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.	1.6761815577425463
"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,"said she.	4.576597589213947
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half - hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.	2.169574077725821
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's love?""I never saw a more promising inclination.	3.5175575677121795
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	1.514702507434842
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?""Oh, yes! - - of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.	2.5480111680458553
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	1.9784795754733158
But does not Jane correspond with the sister?	2.707093371477175
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.	1.7661645423776602
They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.	1.3806891777488906
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.	4.224236879506076
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.	2.7892037361090463
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.	3.4960215928694898
In short, I will do my best.""Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often.	2.565715096659027
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.	1.8364083602809333
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.	2.065468731798299
I enquired after their brother, of course.	2.625435436704066
I dare say I shall soon see them here."Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	4.879707786949225
I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	1.266849565773907
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.	2.98928686755885
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.	1.7798426113035504
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	2.2757820561328814
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear - sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	1.2915326257395445
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.	1.4342740255442445
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.	4.403986607815984
But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.	2.723504449041746
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	1.095039506288279
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.	1.8107434376678362
There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.	1.581164380217219
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.	1.598403260361114
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.	1.7656790725744587
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.	1.9814511396947314
It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long.	3.1649701994351336
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch - street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.	1.440196421244162
We _will_ know where we have gone - - we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	1.9741701021789915
At length the Parsonage was discernible.	12.862541739001463
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	1.4759949125235365
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	1.7200792600285828
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.	1.095039506288279
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.	1.4129767338216859
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.	1.6915175075521292
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.	1.960300606701177
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	7.362681005278058
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.	2.4892133652727626
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	5.954904573063049
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. - - Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's.	1.433649316374054
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.	1.6066587700636223
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. - - He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.	1.3914210369187718
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.	1.9898438732574117
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! - - I never heard of such a thing.	2.563863799098335
Without a governess you must have been neglected.""Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.	1.79682262246295
We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	3.268919362670395
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	3.7070265423371462
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company.	2.7707557471218123
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! - - I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.""Upon my word,"said her Ladyship,"you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. - - Pray, what is your age?""With three younger sisters grown up,"replied Elizabeth smiling,"your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	1.3879932412634166
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs.	11.341835504065475
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.	1.095039506288279
Sir William did not say much.	5.889096272688957
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.	3.317647915994264
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.	1.5200067227480176
As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	1.683195486944551
While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.	1.2711981369680083
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	5.380982626666284
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	2.9664107516666363
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.	1.4433313801697396
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	1.8324085137416248
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.	3.5424178603176752
Have you never happened to see her there?"She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.	1.554836014090082
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing - room.	2.233772473661324
Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.	1.78102652758838
Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.	5.380982626666284
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?	1.095039506288279
What is it you are talking of?	3.6979812444085023
Let me hear what it is.""We are speaking of music, Madam,"said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.	3.3996779446433303
If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.	5.9543246365323075
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.	2.899125989700337
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.	5.1696476440019525
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano - forte in Mrs.	2.070153306394493
Jenkinson's room.	10.378055824389197
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.	2.216656898471886
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me.""I shall not say that you are mistaken,"he replied,"because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam,"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.	1.3340455374749594
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.""You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	4.618463157494354
He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you - - but so it was.	4.223909304097794
They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	2.6756669847237036
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.	2.542238264281786
We neither of us perform to strangers."Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.	1.578695145645563
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs.	3.229275190641715
Little more than half a day's journey.	1.095039506288279
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.""I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match,"cried Elizabeth.	2.7059313330082357
Collins was settled _near_ her family.""It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.	2.3086502374740587
The tête - à - tête surprised them.	3.434433694106887
Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.	1.9172597378545013
He seldom appeared really animated.	4.094805758240274
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out. - - She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.	1.4115402440314861
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	1.7164141700789222
It seemed like wilful ill - nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	1.3311603570492967
It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.	1.5931142280330177
Are you going much farther?""No, I should have turned in a moment."And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.	2.1092879571712895
"Yes - - if Darcy does not put it off again.	7.610489034859018
But I am at his disposal.	10.321814638842405
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	4.6240630952518975
I speak feelingly.	6.294668998441463
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence?	2.830070119475329
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.	1.4046252485195032
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.""Are you, indeed?	2.89487957727143
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?	5.963922824773598
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.	1.4462913771060208
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.	2.1631621777242533
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.""Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?""I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.""And what arts did he use to separate them?""He did not talk to me of his own arts,"said Fitzwilliam smiling.	1.2196514986718088
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,"said she.	5.709131823768934
There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.	2.004666905011933
"There were some very strong objections against the lady,"were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.	1.5771336365726136
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.	1.4781721339525047
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.	1.815076276523422
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	1.6438456740935592
Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	2.9626947010495694
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.	1.8281373360686286
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.	1.9161670027368234
Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.	5.665739352034942
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	2.5617945281715415
She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.	2.805965989968614
In spite of her deeply - rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.	1.5576501444330382
He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.	1.800035945102628
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.	2.4992388111644734
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?	3.9127388762893154
You know I have.	70.96391291061946
Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.	1.241135100078824
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	6.101742863647957
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	2.4255513570777913
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	2.6698398256273133
"Can you deny that you have done it?"she repeated.	8.173697219189776
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.	2.300303262640062
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.	2.192717629333027
"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	6.212804521194947
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing.	1.4817897948155265
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	1.5056363423752155
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	1.095039506288279
But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	1.435823280412195
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.	1.7829833769211443
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	1.7580875486365672
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.	1.9015636962131885
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure,"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	1.4573888106349702
It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows: - -"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.	1.4649288005790992
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.	1.8787987748670958
The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, - - and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. - - Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. - - But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. - - If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry. - - The necessity must be obeyed - - and farther apology would be absurd. - - I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country. - - But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. - - I had often seen him in love before. - - At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.	1.2110561331621925
Your sister I also watched. - - Her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. - - If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in an error.	1.2560798589116224
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. - - That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain, - - but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. - - I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; - - I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. - - My objections to the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. - - But there were other causes of repugnance; - - causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. - - These causes must be stated, though briefly. - - The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. - - Pardon me. - - It pains me to offend you.	1.1797664078410708
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.	2.065107280970747
If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them. - - With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.	1.509317396107092
Here again I shall give you pain - - to what degree you only can tell.	2.9483607833822614
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.	1.4961404194145782
It adds even another motive.	4.177529570148766
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.	1.457335730706116
How he lived I know not.	4.274773426950351
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.	1.438157955486491
His revenge would have been complete indeed.	3.4013449862504292
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.	1.4922404763898705
It was all pride and insolence.	24.53601891575476
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.	1.4424886615534291
Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.	2.130172498820004
She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	1.605279488066873
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.	1.5995367091445583
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	1.5019926559853878
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.	1.3882023198417537
"How despicably have I acted!"she cried. - -"I, who have prided myself on my discernment! - - I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust. - - How humiliating is this discovery! - - Yet, how just a humiliation! - - Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.	1.4953472495707032
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.	1.3038886708810187
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.	5.293008779208355
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.	1.6330640787955533
"What would she have said? - - how would she have behaved?"were questions with which she amused herself.	2.7909192502499294
But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me! - - They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are.	1.7786681432847709
His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	2.3870484522388336
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.	1.5503243702636822
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.""I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"replied Elizabeth,"but it is not in my power to accept it. - - I must be in town next Saturday.""Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	1.964487631474521
I expected you to stay two months.	16.633815832068347
I told Mrs.	65.36248788299663
It is highly improper.	23.750946287441312
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. - - Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.	1.830503527025271
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her. - - Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. - - I am excessively attentive to all those things.	1.399250074121822
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.	1.095039506288279
In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	2.200904443695422
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	1.234321576600256
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	1.9011475156671291
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,"said he,"whether Mrs.	8.220073427895384
We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	1.401683493527714
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.	1.9616016784847021
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.	2.4323443955408703
We seem to have been designed for each other."Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	1.6468004544193338
She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.	2.667214108518889
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	2.3368394060185333
"But,"he added,"you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."Elizabeth made no objection; - - the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.	1.983534426901531
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	1.6196491813283693
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,"Is not this nice?	1.5301372681462446
is not this an agreeable surprise?""And we mean to treat you all,"added Lydia;"but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."Then shewing her purchases:"Look here, I have bought this bonnet.	1.4822939536809279
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	2.3363558135890363
But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone.	3.8470382057730013
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.	4.3622445485363945
Wickham is safe.""And Mary King is safe!"added Elizabeth;"safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.""She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.""But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"said Jane.	2.0913353662764864
"I am sure there is not on _his_.	15.212869247957263
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.	4.045756011387176
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.	1.7134999183926554
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	1.5442844876421964
Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.	1.095039506288279
Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.	2.5593548616644504
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.	1.9681694942098908
Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	1.5116660599109957
and Mrs.	94.42968908348026
Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.	1.095039506288279
Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.	2.6203263335228746
Their reception at home was most kind.	7.659879917306894
In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.	1.792595639940651
What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.	1.5517165296340867
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	2.2410883936600707
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.	1.095039506288279
"I do not know when I have been more shocked,"said she.	13.760549457521197
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	2.4598171973014864
I was uncomfortable enough.	20.908431846393324
And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!""How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved.""Certainly.	1.4257738629907328
What is your own opinion?""That it ought not to be attempted.	2.085654613955957
I am not equal to it.	13.731602064525656
We must not make him desperate."The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	2.667877947554871
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.	1.7729331386168874
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.	1.4471353120099593
Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.	1.2654722050560125
"Well, Lizzy,"said Mrs.	29.225727166636418
Bennet one day,"what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?	1.7603130444121962
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.	4.7007368746149
"Well, Lizzy,"continued her mother soon afterwards,"and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?	3.3743982457910016
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	3.120620473491959
"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.	2.028580248737195
"If one could but go to Brighton!"observed Mrs.	9.689855578948697
This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.	2.2356530799721965
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.	2.094172621478526
Forster, the delight of Mrs.	8.691209143607745
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.	1.3862195438744267
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.""Indeed you are mistaken.	1.9839023444917387
I have no such injuries to resent.	21.147609101138965
If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	1.5119711978987556
Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	1.5736535404673753
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.	16.422112127364084
Let her go then.	6.924683389144822
At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life."With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	1.5149915412450343
They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.	2.552765299097191
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.	1.9610790877212496
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.	2.206743542416639
In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.	1.60820391053606
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	1.5162857852741685
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man, asked her how she had liked him.	1.3867005280722982
"And pray may I ask?"but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone,"Is it in address that he improves?	2.657913021449026
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	1.6484694784561096
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.	2.128830739921489
Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	1.9645553387642845
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	1.6785582523083085
Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.	1.095039506288279
But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	1.436661054140894
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	2.4439054119807846
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	4.315421848597356
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.	1.2932049816169207
Forster called her, and they were going to the camp; - - and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt - - for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.	1.3360509743026268
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.	4.302522562863043
Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.	1.2860846319686665
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.	2.983746045456253
But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs.	7.508403866398537
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.	3.3213428369400946
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?"said her aunt.	2.69227659480776
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
They have some of the finest woods in the country."Elizabeth said no more - - but her mind could not acquiesce.	2.6009545718907843
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	2.307182012481885
It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; - - and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	1.9112744257572405
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	2.3706719169439148
They followed her into the dining - parlour.	9.221807053560282
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.	2.391334687320201
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,"is my master - - and very like him.	2.2841559702142593
Gardiner, looking at the picture;"it is a handsome face.	4.59455357991773
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.	1.9681694942098908
He was very fond of them."This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.	2.1275249205251923
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
I do not know who is good enough for him."Mr. and Mrs.	5.6607036484827855
You are lucky in having such a master.""Yes, Sir, I know I am.	3.1734186719160307
If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.	3.647829322863137
Gardiner.	5067.3907354656785
Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	1.5104602811933139
"He is certainly a good brother,"said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.	5.30998811177883
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.	3.002253121971044
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	1.729953647195589
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill - judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?	1.2865320312844146
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.	2.1778342836742355
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered, - - what could it mean?	2.0895197543077826
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	3.353511837652016
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	1.361729697638758
Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	2.6777527013761047
Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.	1.369759900694506
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.	1.095039506288279
With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words"delightful,"and"charming,"when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	1.3105013068680753
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.	1.2591526013525882
Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating,"Why is he so altered?	3.5562594076643363
From what can it proceed?	7.90503937632069
It originated in Mrs.	5.221971415004847
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.	2.5980338317279372
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.	1.3004047534965248
Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.	3.361830157179656
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.	1.7483753988969366
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,"said her uncle.	6.805431060551298
I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.""I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	2.91709726419778
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.	1.5831639846620869
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"replied her uncle.	3.7552922082492293
"From what we have seen of him,"continued Mrs.	13.206525541189047
In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	1.4119981306022402
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.	1.6383688500903884
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	1.51763520895141
While these newly - born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	1.7074342617032705
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	1.4853403979379274
They had long wished to see him.	4.877160966950553
Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.	2.4268155170707035
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	1.7296608035298349
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.	2.76932497482097
On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	1.6483496248090892
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs.	1.6302001436059534
Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	1.1396026378306858
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs.	9.118206717915543
Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.	2.789074583162861
There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.	1.790791358910557
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	1.399175929433753
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.	1.5682242398514532
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.	1.2539146074006016
But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.	1.5727480913747935
Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude - - for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	1.53890062364794
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	8.679900290516173
Annesley, a genteel, agreeable - looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs.	1.5860645285291703
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family.	1.7899320592837413
She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	4.606192775270357
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	1.4099937253537649
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement.	4.325462786996482
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.	1.3351616516637597
Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.	1.4304319199328412
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.	1.5023452753182
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.	2.9639266153006596
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.	1.095039506288279
Our poor mother is sadly grieved.	1.9117795643988884
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.	1.4855487339145834
F.	2003.235629911036
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.	1.095039506288279
He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.	1.7011997264250758
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing? - - Impossible.	1.646745749807955
Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.	1.732225564392119
Adieu.	417.19089068142733
What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening.	1.5330889503853404
Had I but explained some part of it only - - some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened.	1.482076168681041
But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.	1.8648738659467547
How are they even to be discovered?	7.134567392988769
It is every way horrible!"Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	3.47155429013469
Wretched, wretched, mistake!"Darcy made no answer.	1.5728065161765794
Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.	1.6012025179962115
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.	1.3876892583171887
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	2.0582332544273054
Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.	2.2614576471486467
She was wild to be at home - - to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.	1.3118299610544335
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power. - - Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.	1.2898451535078272
"But what is to be done about Pemberley?"cried Mrs.	12.265076774546959
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?	1.8325242287236154
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.	2.363156970329171
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.	10.334910361560928
Why must their marriage be private?	4.403986607815984
Oh! no, no, this is not likely.	3.371027005477931
Since the - - - - shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	3.4126334832815814
"I do, indeed,"replied Elizabeth, colouring.	13.486903898830601
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty - - which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.	1.7343518164686802
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.	5.067337145386254
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.""But does Lydia know nothing of this?	2.8181159735911354
And when I returned home, the - - - - shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	3.475456442437279
That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts.""When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other.""Not the slightest.	1.3995378418623625
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."* * * * * It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.	1.2651502449018468
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.	3.160082750196989
"Not yet,"replied Jane.	31.218429512024723
"If I had been able,"said she,"to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.	2.20058081270018
Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?	1.7218974428692555
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.	1.5126488951957089
And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	1.497912229173246
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	2.7679355581483285
And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.""Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!""Perhaps it would have been better;"replied her sister.	1.4108566531979276
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.	2.4086869320661606
I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.	3.409847891969532
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to - night.	2.0051340462244505
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you will drink to our good journey.	3.3691863368606283
"Your affectionate friend,"LYDIA BENNET.""Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!"cried Elizabeth when she had finished it.	2.9808133283608567
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy.	2.6752736280022402
You do not look well.	33.295421937769675
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.	1.7074342617032705
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.	1.9829580847421098
Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.	1.095039506288279
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	1.6788585489799144
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.	1.9309365592136791
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.	1.3161232453147313
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	1.7934258644781154
If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	2.548007884520069
But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person."Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	1.410686742830189
It was as follows:"MY DEAR SIR,"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.	1.5976004633157084
"A gamester!"she cried.	56.88414503871205
I had not an idea of it."Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.	3.1380334531494154
"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.	2.9186687144300913
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.	2.6672705393488316
"MY DEAR BROTHER,"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.	2.883753968817907
All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.	1.4847999541668457
She comes to us to - day.	4.147130659558114
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on.	3.5753285598253575
"Oh! my dear father,"she cried,"come back, and write immediately.	10.34354045314731
A small sum could not do all this.""No,"said her father,"Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	2.661394020435928
I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.""Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.	2.3754014549084896
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	1.5880150669547213
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.	2.201266804377561
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.""Their conduct has been such,"replied Elizabeth,"as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.	1.3957598473217618
He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,"Just as you please.""May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?""Take whatever you like, and get away."Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.	1.3400450994982178
Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.	2.2729987785753853
After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.	2.630310815221744
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	2.6060276873026784
How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.	1.7327089395613595
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.	1.095039506288279
I will put on my things in a moment.	6.823605409824461
My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.	2.444238786788992
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted.	1.4228399716596036
One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.	1.5871115112161116
My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?	4.016682368361878
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.	1.879206308322767
She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.	1.8851791122252566
Bennet and the children.	7.89809039554464
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.	1.3659460809178559
His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.	1.7798426113035504
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.	1.5615173328007068
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.	2.76932497482097
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.	1.2954859500361704
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.	1.7497254802258142
"Haye - Park might do,"said she,"if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing - room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained.	1.5406173857128507
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her,"Mrs.	4.028980503172473
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much.	2.0238913443654547
She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	4.157949512858418
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	1.4176370208147488
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.	3.277483188918841
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	1.466316339648648
To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	1.769742770322107
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.	1.6549371493745835
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	5.6519734861007445
Forster,"said she,"it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.	2.2016142395444853
The officers may not be so pleasant in General - - - -'s regiment."His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.	2.6030414457011237
Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.	1.5297743236411794
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.	1.392428682040307
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.	1.095039506288279
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first.	1.5870375980694538
Her ease and good spirits increased.	3.8958969585462344
She longed to see Mrs.	29.2088928368468
Wickham,"by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.	1.6693924805826978
I only hope they may have half my good luck.	8.42561020544293
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.""Very true; and if I had my will, we should.	1.8881647938374009
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	5.420031443832149
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.	1.8080928188640188
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.	1.3437572762425682
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	2.026162931668509
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?""No really,"replied Elizabeth;"I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.""La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off.	2.5526886143344485
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.	1.7151288880884272
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.	1.5437375901645054
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	1.9616016784847021
And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.	2.3929431870488314
It was to be such a secret!""If it was to be secret,"said Jane,"say not another word on the subject.	3.3878852833757684
Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding.	7.639304381944646
<NUM>.	1.095039506288279
Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	3.2095387820409225
His character was to speak for itself.	7.440403061385612
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.	3.702586466342558
He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us.	1.7919406437534569
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.	1.6067462015539893
At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished - for direction.	6.371398800377127
Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	1.5717978130073893
He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.	2.513266098677856
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.	1.520069559657276
But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.	1.6047290182734255
But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.	1.4079356135805767
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above.	1.6543171503294187
When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.	1.6217803835593825
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	2.5049398348159087
Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding.	2.945421537031384
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.	1.737444813131693
His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.	1.7798426113035504
I thought him very sly; - - he hardly ever mentioned your name.	2.1935260185035577
Pray forgive me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far, as to exclude me from P.	1.9246634825382365
He had to be sure done much.	4.72010830261359
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.	2.515386813583063
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.	1.427791351772263
She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.	2.2790741441927205
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.	2.1691470470443384
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.	3.3194905047474053
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.	1.5932701074226117
I am very glad you liked her.	39.721608170811066
I hope she will turn out well.""I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.""Did you go by the village of Kympton?""I do not recollect that we did.""I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.	2.0613789958807702
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.	2.899097571579907
One ought not to repine; - - but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be.	1.6398888869246344
You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good - humoured smile,"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	1.6012068916020323
Do not let us quarrel about the past.	4.310152740474748
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.	1.7787997005128358
Not these two or three years perhaps.""Write to me very often, my dear.""As often as I can.	1.6297467780398671
My sisters may write to _me_.	3.9780692440635113
"I often think,"said she,"that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.	4.177888579720162
Philips first brought her the news.)"Well, so much the better.	3.170158089108261
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.	4.224208644218541
They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.	2.5014496512713493
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	2.7945416469300968
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	1.5776948077593482
He knows where we live.	18.901146035487642
"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	2.524720201899062
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.	1.676001248623166
That tall, proud man.""Good gracious! Mr. Darcy! - - and so it does I vow.	2.3848318207837416
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.	1.3497486331659245
He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.	2.409841753337304
It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.	5.591591423185591
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	2.322881396590014
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.	2.146828892741039
There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.	2.1075207275979215
But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.	1.518483167287808
She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.	4.156581567323761
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	7.3057643035047795
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.	4.713487025951715
It was only said,'Lately, George Wickham, Esq.	3.973218486454187
to Miss Lydia Bennet,'without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	1.2954976591960345
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.	2.5430913984556605
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.	5.8951290823965925
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	1.53291977095314
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	2.2172727462728976
Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.	2.289231023607106
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,"she added,"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.	2.9776574509574427
They then went away.	31.323054071739563
Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	8.906832097193185
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.	4.148917708904655
"Oh, Jane, take care.""My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now.""I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."* * * * * They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.	2.651855451209158
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.	1.4666741801166037
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.	1.819285496777822
He placed himself by her.	4.094805758240274
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.	1.4585900404368208
She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?	1.6409169923260658
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,"Is your sister at Pemberley still?""Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.""And quite alone?	1.7228417468228656
Have all her friends left her?""Mrs.	3.3194905047474053
The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.	2.2363523811842465
He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.	1.425576380655764
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.	2.956199491892459
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.	7.676292987704046
Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.'She did indeed.	3.166898305772932
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	1.707840518094881
It mortifies me.	7.136995627125605
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.	3.9081282159837727
Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante."A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.	1.095039506288279
& c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	2.9170741738813115
"Can you come to - morrow?"Yes, he had no engagement at all for to - morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.	3.1953996346150317
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.	2.575378782826877
He is come - - Mr. Bingley is come. - - He is, indeed.	3.146226059248893
Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	2.670333733650111
Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?"But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.	2.1572240194163994
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.	2.1450859513641034
I did not wink at you."She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,"took her out of the room.	1.9531393132384167
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.	2.2320009503905185
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.	5.0484962290109765
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.	2.6333496238085266
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.	1.5381935275917256
"'Tis too much!"she added,"by far too much.	8.51122661225818
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.	2.636615827103652
"I must go instantly to my mother;"she cried.	13.15910340929999
"With my mother up stairs.	6.088370377354047
She will be down in a moment I dare say."He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.	2.4201194421842254
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.	2.420579984754846
Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.	1.6549162722285364
You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.""I hope not so.	1.4281983083047192
At that moment, she cared for no other.	12.146129684614797
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.	1.5525701641711336
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.	2.505050275841578
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	1.6546245237276824
My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family.""You have a very small park here,"returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.	1.8099206377085242
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs.	1.6627376480402247
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.""Go, my dear,"cried her mother,"and shew her ladyship about the different walks.	3.176733934068197
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.	2.353662178479864
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting - woman was in it.	2.1186399075437836
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.	1.4173277417433627
But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	1.8648738659467547
A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	2.25143444541202
What could your ladyship propose by it?""At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.""Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,"said Elizabeth, coolly,"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.""If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	1.491541137504905
Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?""Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.""It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.	1.9330605095133424
Now what have you to say?""Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	1.5147747750341225
While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	1.342185697121659
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?	4.27889782377038
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.	2.7398890266104305
You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	5.022178943174642
Is nothing due to me on that score?	3.324415495534973
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.""_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_.""I will not be interrupted.	1.9188763621232283
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	1.8740720239564508
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.	1.9311439205860397
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.""Whatever my connections may be,"said Elizabeth,"if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.""Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,"I am not."Lady Catherine seemed pleased.	1.6630978366989964
Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?	1.095039506288279
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.	2.98928686755885
Is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?	1.8581875865817221
I must beg to return to the house."And she rose as she spoke.	3.767525083180505
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.""Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,"replied Elizabeth,"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.	1.5166329968972634
No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.	2.916528054198397
"She did not choose it,"said her daughter,"she would go.""She is a very fine - looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.	1.8011646858066193
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.	1.326097556176509
In that case he would return no more.	8.07920603207011
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.	2.3529465357022543
"Lizzy,"said he,"I was going to look for you; come into my room."She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.	2.482809485082982
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.	4.150818315369599
What relates to yourself, is as follows.	5.242402694852796
"Are you not diverted?""Oh! yes.	8.61601686091634
It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.	2.842168801081635
But it is so strange!""Yes - - _that_ is what makes it amusing.	4.333307486797686
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit.	1.095039506288279
Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	1.6016368977248254
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.	1.095039506288279
Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.""I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,"replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion,"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	2.261524342345711
Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.""If you _will_ thank me,"he replied,"let it be for yourself alone.	1.697656879873118
There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	2.0312305861795044
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied,"Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	1.519070893493729
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.""What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?	1.4514035873186313
For, though your accusations were ill - founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	1.587810101546691
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.""I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	2.8950665367478345
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.	7.116702769624941
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.	1.3176074722045255
"I knew,"said he,"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.	3.832573685830318
As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper.	3.4882763486845723
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.	1.0950395062882792
Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.	2.8339796136617843
His surprise was great.	5.99461271870344
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.""And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.""It did.	1.6765605569495812
He has heartily forgiven me now."Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.	1.5516680344164442
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	1.3141619260169866
I speak nothing but the truth.	3.266963118052798
_That_ is all to be forgot.	18.314418368303013
Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.	2.3181900019396897
It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	3.102023544470953
I am afraid you will be angry.""My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	5.078732298431818
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.	2.8711510302271526
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning,"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?	2.677719099099163
It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.""It may do very well for the others,"replied Mr. Bingley;"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.	1.8636133381321263
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.	1.9692964578045522
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.	2.9186687144300913
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.	2.023319709465876
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	2.155970884859783
When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.	1.674991561717609
A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me.	1.6744281512132013
I shall go distracted."This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.	1.746946447014836
"How could you begin?"said she.	21.942594650265356
Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?""For the liveliness of your mind, I did.""You may as well call it impertinence at once.	1.8832842786847728
It was very little less.	14.416343018171785
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.	1.7656790725744587
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	3.7036293406964442
The moral will be perfectly fair.	3.405645933868843
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.	4.448768510381083
My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.""Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?""I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.	1.3920499292599051
You supposed more than really existed.	3.7556219317083914
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.	1.095039506288279
"Your's sincerely, & c."Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	3.2983262267405165
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.	2.700408892810838
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	1.598403260361114
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.	2.4992388111644734
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.	3.457494533891902
Mrs.	151.30792430560422
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.	1.3256611739133457
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.	4.629005644243565
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.	2.59577095499566
Bingley and talked of Mrs.	14.427523197282738
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	2.055101237552195
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.	8.631182824753008
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	1.3087971976867
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.	2.4863843670984056
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	1.5874394529844709
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.	2.1981156481582613
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.	2.2843224089281784
If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy.	2.11713791591137
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.	1.7707878961253327
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.	1.7149556981777492
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.	1.095039506288279
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	1.468488141215159
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.	1.5880221038486557
