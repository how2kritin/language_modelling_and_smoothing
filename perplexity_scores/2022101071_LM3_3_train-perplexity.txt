11.193420547321567
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	13.399809235120022
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.	11.552740467797896
"My dear Mr. Bennet,"said his lady to him one day,"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.	11.036313722902177
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?"cried his wife impatiently.	11.268414017115107
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."This was invitation enough.	11.861445555671972
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.	11.469061170575312
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.""What is his name?""Bingley.""Is he married or single?""Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.	10.707248481777647
how can it affect them?""My dear Mr. Bennet,"replied his wife,"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""Is that his design in settling here?""Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.""I see no occasion for that.	11.115034083923552
You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.""My dear, you flatter me.	13.540174534600995
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	10.82981772722319
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.	11.123972217530595
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	9.487380654695194
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.""You are over scrupulous surely.	11.495462516296897
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.	13.242326950214391
But you are always giving _her_ the preference.""They have none of them much to recommend them,"replied he;"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.""Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	10.370647123998607
You take delight in vexing me.	8.100906996426305
I have a high respect for your nerves.	10.299649672741586
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.""Ah! you do not know what I suffer.""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	10.202178526771979
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.	9.743470404716163
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.	8.397634260915186
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	9.553956155176612
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.	14.065369760492105
It was then disclosed in the following manner.	12.188144797544785
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"said her mother resentfully,"since we are not to visit.""But you forget, mama,"said Elizabeth,"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.	12.118529316648734
Long has promised to introduce him.""I do not believe Mrs.	9.04517628157323
Long will do any such thing.	11.915370796131656
She has two nieces of her own.	12.202516070718916
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.""No more have I,"said Mr. Bennet;"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."Mrs.	12.070474678859684
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	12.758106356140507
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves.	8.999164208697639
You tear them to pieces.""Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,"said her father;"she times them ill.""I do not cough for my own amusement,"replied Kitty fretfully.	11.20721121011021
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?""To - morrow fortnight.""Aye, so it is,"cried her mother,"and Mrs.	13.118658630168268
Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.""Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.""Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?""I honour your circumspection.	13.44580020781428
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.	12.761571588568833
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.	14.72059311400009
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.	9.743832912112222
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet said only,"Nonsense, nonsense!""What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"cried he.	10.974768110459808
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.	10.723003487995143
What say you, Mary?	20.484135437793736
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts."Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	12.908877905993789
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,"he continued,"let us return to Mr. Bingley.""I am sick of Mr. Bingley,"cried his wife.	9.604272658185083
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.	15.82552606740527
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.	12.313119456100766
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.	12.638294363118236
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last.	14.532671958802759
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.""Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,"said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	13.345618243722816
"What an excellent father you have, girls,"said she, when the door was shut.	10.271856845964566
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.	12.122757995248746
At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.	12.81879786112144
Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.""Oh!"said Lydia stoutly,"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest."The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.	10.633498672562114
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.	11.203263416403066
Her report was highly favourable.	8.986825260029116
Sir William had been delighted with him.	14.983712833524006
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.	10.921932528297763
Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.	9.390068304950843
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"said Mrs.	10.03986416415175
Bennet to her husband,"and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.	14.95591136847451
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.	12.291085201032713
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	7.016443892539102
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.	11.147781840320715
Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, & c.	11.168992207797817
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.	11.626431703785784
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	10.442291006127485
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.	11.255555483899663
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman - like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	9.581795813244948
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.	8.327265787816804
His brother - in - law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	9.833988445395855
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.	11.425156272186141
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.	10.653602398823963
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.	7.729554823599682
What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.	9.618164543166731
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	10.474905149903808
His character was decided.	9.556514545122146
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	11.44640272845233
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.	12.694463639172552
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.	12.68759519402062
"Come, Darcy,"said he,"I must have you dance.	12.625485875222893
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	8.37625132655743
You had much better dance.""I certainly shall not.	12.99628903060022
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	12.922555292114291
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.""I would not be so fastidious as you are,"cried Bingley,"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	12.989562203411241
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.""Which do you mean?"and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.	10.455203314103981
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."Mr. Bingley followed his advice.	10.29528585958267
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	8.956176422325777
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	11.186267752740504
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	9.226176520495786
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.	10.752345841023468
Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.	12.08338175195589
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.	15.107613801761374
They found Mr. Bennet still up.	12.381690076758652
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	11.974521567281016
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.	13.880177677951579
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,"as she entered the room,"we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	13.701043875908352
Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.	11.834368117386546
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.	12.596322093311665
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	17.236209365414023
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	19.10748740747197
Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger - - - -""If he had had any compassion for _me_,"cried her husband impatiently,"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners.	11.305172019338897
Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!""Oh! my dear,"continued Mrs.	10.01698952764356
He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women.	10.883199784547198
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	8.727937887962687
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.	6.459011740006044
Hurst's gown - - - -"Here she was interrupted again.	12.317387380086535
Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery.	6.869505080222571
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.	9.128882136604572
"But I can assure you,"she added,"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.	9.339040821603438
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	11.647623029109806
I quite detest the man."When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.	12.860968200744615
"He is just what a young man ought to be,"said she,"sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! - - so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!""He is also handsome,"replied Elizabeth,"which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	12.012562934083144
His character is thereby complete.""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	9.856664022884443
_I_ did for you.	12.79301030238803
But that is one great difference between us.	10.08083171205645
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	10.528716704800262
What could be more natural than his asking you again?	13.24733691665603
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.	8.476530371709439
No thanks to his gallantry for that.	13.778663032756102
Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.	16.2057355863234
You have liked many a stupider person.""Dear Lizzy!""Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	10.62472403631346
You never see a fault in any body.	11.018541166348756
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.	11.225094401030313
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.""I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.""I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	11.376134640547964
With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough; - - one meets it every where.	7.532365319596939
But to be candid without ostentation or design - - to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad - - belongs to you alone.	12.512134306308019
And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?	15.841879102248011
Their manners are not equal to his.""Certainly not; at first.	13.306690523995254
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.	9.950668947365497
They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.	9.736089921858298
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. - - Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.	11.256795240058795
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.	10.776269726126234
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.	10.063541546171006
Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.	9.585598785838002
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. - - Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.	10.3516509055599
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	10.271270167191513
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.	12.84078348966367
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	12.555813845130722
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	9.667447235160893
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.	11.45937373590977
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.	10.789648222268236
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.	12.709634402788325
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.	13.318156839242372
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.	9.284585463801895
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	9.38809348290209
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	6.0543024277551
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	10.542812262247278
For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.	10.391797199358445
By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.	5.903240645267698
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.	11.129928299622502
Bennet. - - They had several children.	12.843784533520378
The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty - seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.	11.010166155835
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	10.820263834069156
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,"said Mrs.	11.416682289858283
Bennet with civil self - command to Miss Lucas.	8.91733123034329
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her - - indeed I rather believe he _did_ - - I heard something about it - - but I hardly know what - - something about Mr. Robinson.""Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?	11.36802446926943
Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	11.257599571972447
and his answering immediately to the last question - - Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.""Upon my word! - - Well, that was very decided indeed - - that does seem as if - - - - but however, it may all come to nothing you know.""_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,"said Charlotte.	11.381883413851837
"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? - - Poor Eliza! - - to be only just _tolerable_.""I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill - treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.	12.357777161641414
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.""Are you quite sure, Ma'am? - - is not there a little mistake?"said Jane. - -"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.""Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; - - but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.""Miss Bingley told me,"said Jane,"that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	11.480707655328361
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.	12.277109410391454
Long.	17.824174952451187
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.	12.51803349544534
If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.""That is very true,"replied Elizabeth,"and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.""Pride,"observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections,"is a very common failing I believe.	11.992881673948323
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	10.255091789048043
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.	7.568447507723714
I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.""Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,"said Mrs.	8.690178933646772
Bennet;"and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly."The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	13.790466819803692
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	8.914976009007367
The visit was returned in due form.	8.073432682176641
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs.	10.643457247351037
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	11.371495793206103
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.	12.435638225457884
"It may perhaps be pleasant,"replied Charlotte,"to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.	12.118832725987739
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	9.835063378626927
We can all _begin_ freely - - a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.	9.810601123520367
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.	9.15333092774067
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.""But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.""Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	12.408498278749864
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.	9.500067683634882
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.	10.976147052639197
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.""Your plan is a good one,"replied Elizabeth,"where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.	12.271801682466057
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	12.559657703145701
As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.	15.941079703562899
She has known him only a fortnight.	10.939545895007091
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.	11.344794568565488
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before - hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.	10.423378806040068
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.""You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	10.545943055895282
You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.	12.567274931326939
Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	12.888518973308098
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	10.988366595442121
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	7.285756001099841
Of this she was perfectly unaware; - - to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.	13.157461203915142
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	15.684032372423038
His doing so drew her notice.	7.562751341346759
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.	10.129781665196065
"What does Mr. Darcy mean,"said she to Charlotte,"by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?""That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.""But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.	12.587871426063485
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?""With great energy; - - but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.""You are severe on us.""It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed,"said Miss Lucas.	10.763456742737047
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.""You are a very strange creature by way of a friend! - - always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body! - - If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers."On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added,"Very well; if it must be so, it must."And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy,"There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with - -'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'- - and I shall keep mine to swell my song."Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	10.281968380264093
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.	12.270724406582453
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.	9.1352528560464
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.	10.393884157179286
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! - - There is nothing like dancing after all. - - I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.""Certainly, Sir; - - and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. - - Every savage can dance."Sir William only smiled.	9.85654999565467
Do you often dance at St. James's?""Never, sir.""Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?""It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.""You have a house in town, I conclude?"Mr. Darcy bowed.	12.320051359071122
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? - - Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. - - You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. - - I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.	12.032818647781923
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.""Mr. Darcy is all politeness,"said Elizabeth, smiling.	11.079506555375161
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,"I can guess the subject of your reverie.""I should imagine not.""You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner - - in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	12.469158639284718
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people! - - What would I give to hear your strictures on them!""Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.	8.067331599070288
My mind was more agreeably engaged.	11.82794276129407
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	10.99247157873437
How long has she been such a favourite? - - and pray when am I to wish you joy?""That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.	11.122094608030269
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.	10.2824500101864
I knew you would be wishing me joy.""Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.	11.312079340747083
You will have a charming mother - in - law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	11.75033918714012
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.	9.791226639518136
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.	13.796747129546107
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.	10.286993592466981
The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.	8.840703478556948
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.	12.20920627409722
Their visits to Mrs.	8.0921704109958
Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.	11.559309084194997
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers'names and connections.	9.697845343992842
Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	12.117584824895188
Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.	9.589931573628055
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.	11.413328108222327
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed,"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.	11.686763954318833
I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.	12.433597824025178
"I am astonished, my dear,"said Mrs.	8.129454267355207
Bennet,"that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.	13.204233812052882
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however.""If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.""Yes - - but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.""This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	14.402422746612524
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.""My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. - - When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.	10.214665785042788
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well - - and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals.""Mama,"cried Lydia,"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."Mrs.	10.213169602179073
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.	12.175831588194598
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
what does he say?	10.666862830552898
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.""It is from Miss Bingley,"said Jane, and then read it aloud.	11.762600313970669
"My dear Friend,"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête - à - tête between two women can never end without a quarrel.	9.588691605976683
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.	14.300345143198113
Yours ever,"CAROLINE BINGLEY.""With the officers!"cried Lydia.	13.072657096261048
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_.""Dining out,"said Mrs.	11.445839111219547
They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?""They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.""But if you have got them to - day,"said Elizabeth,"my mother's purpose will be answered."She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.	11.634906816619154
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.	12.0837526009643
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.	8.039897850956258
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.	14.437825018346762
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.	8.723374214109528
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"said Mrs.	10.433113980071953
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	13.478215463897914
Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.	13.68739146156731
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better.	12.525944678347699
They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones - - therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me - - and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache there is not much the matter with me.	10.635993246767848
"Yours, & c.""Well, my dear,"said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud,"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.""Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying.	10.646688816159063
She will be taken good care of.	11.924627610269651
As long as she stays there, it is all very well.	13.698472853093563
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage."Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse - woman, walking was her only alternative.	14.190299547442988
She declared her resolution.	10.735631002208867
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	11.37072665914914
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.	9.538752651400934
She was shewn into the breakfast - parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. - - That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.	10.782692816258683
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.	11.08012727459054
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	11.578220651195709
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	12.558269085830352
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	13.0672114579268
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.	13.782493798294098
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	13.391831097401509
She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	11.89134054862528
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.	12.13473360731258
The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	12.522712469132333
The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.	8.845057568041764
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.	12.803335178999529
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.	10.64431027128098
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.	9.189262811814984
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	7.693680471218855
To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.	8.60087298640796
Jane was by no means better.	11.383251587154703
The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	10.574847069961537
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.	15.416644676294425
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.	13.353899151300986
She had very little notice from any but him.	9.231061506949189
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	11.251627538722321
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	12.713955903604015
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	12.881025710724593
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.	8.492816186671979
I could hardly keep my countenance.	10.569991592197113
Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?	10.428435421719097
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!""Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office.""Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,"said Bingley;"but this was all lost upon me.	9.518652824874435
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.""_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley;"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition.""Certainly not.""To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it?	9.625111994645183
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,"observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.""Not at all,"he replied;"they were brightened by the exercise."- - A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.	10.31913789309716
Hurst began again.	11.025957933206147
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.	13.05994271656249
But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.""I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.""Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.""That is capital,"added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	11.47905993567256
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,"cried Bingley,"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.""But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,"replied Darcy.	9.916717354846698
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.	8.911351107902375
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	10.389497818239965
Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	11.682698912829213
"Do you prefer reading to cards?"said he;"that is rather singular.""Miss Eliza Bennet,"said Miss Bingley,"despises cards.	10.541469481213687
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into."Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.	11.246752211664512
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.""I wish it may.""But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	11.670238251398066
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.""With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.""I am talking of possibilities, Charles.""Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card - table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.	9.82845271882168
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"said Miss Bingley;"will she be as tall as I am?""I think she will.	10.771650439453213
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller.""How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.	10.283675587138596
Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano - forte is exquisite.""It is amazing to me,"said Bingley,"how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are.""All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?""Yes, all of them, I think.	10.95339790402201
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.	4.089350697481011
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	6.721993604321017
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	10.707737515055205
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.""Nor I, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley.	11.020850739871465
"Then,"observed Elizabeth,"you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.""Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.""Oh! certainly,"cried his faithful assistant,"no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.	10.920291190005942
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.""All this she must possess,"added Darcy,"and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.""I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	10.612408130015861
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.""Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?""_I_ never saw such a woman.	10.451284049985906
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."Mrs.	14.153321276481696
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	9.426876720068837
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.	9.572833999714488
"Eliza Bennet,"said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.	12.426540907177799
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.""Undoubtedly,"replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.	8.689373706428178
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.	9.405064743717325
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.	15.267958468242085
Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.	9.679701071166509
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.	13.412646093340728
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	9.232898430171485
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.	13.189470953391684
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.	12.756178948522873
The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.	8.235779912519444
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	11.209639977720839
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.	9.060907261740853
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	11.831111232026801
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.	9.372864932632146
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	12.045546176993396
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.	12.767475953138018
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.""Removed!"cried Bingley.	10.527798249884029
"It must not be thought of.	16.45344248225876
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.""You may depend upon it, Madam,"said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."Mrs.	11.272753215019705
"I am sure,"she added,"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with.	12.311195031907516
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.	9.102273077401934
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.	11.779755995297549
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease.""Whatever I do is done in a hurry,"replied he;"and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.	12.851055306016914
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?"cried he, turning towards her.	13.076781374692597
"Oh! yes - - I understand you perfectly.""I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.""That is as it happens.	10.551850105655344
It must be an amusing study.""Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	8.152626950820963
They have at least that advantage.""The country,"said Darcy,"can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.	11.179168104121073
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.""But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.""Yes, indeed,"cried Mrs.	8.77396814481301
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.	9.834883610922581
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town."Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.	13.62400676700702
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.	9.933288820399744
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.	7.46660521367922
The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?""When I am in the country,"he replied,"I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.	14.496950441256615
But that gentleman,"looking at Darcy,"seemed to think the country was nothing at all.""Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,"said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.	13.404616623807428
"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.	8.169738772609225
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.""Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.	12.592803435332343
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	9.589243815763409
What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley - - is not he?	14.33686455236881
so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! - - He has always something to say to every body. - - _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.""Did Charlotte dine with you?""No, she would go home.	10.13562919511394
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	10.023656120610454
For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	6.538182351250752
But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.	13.26351248541245
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain - - but then she is our particular friend.""She seems a very pleasant young woman,"said Bingley.	9.781884061359253
"Oh! dear, yes; - - but you must own she is very plain.	13.71254027256787
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.	11.225232843995638
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane - - one does not often see any body better looking.	13.010082099164089
It is what every body says.	11.56780276142138
I do not trust my own partiality.	11.328835877702254
Perhaps he thought her too young.	12.656934384810102
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.""And so ended his affection,"said Elizabeth impatiently.	12.142680567513473
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.	14.8159735553801
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!""I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,"said Darcy.	7.2888310492332
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	6.452790029235256
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	9.029709979302487
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	12.393185216819681
Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.	11.939469937146777
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.	7.328770877536465
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	12.586000608467755
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.	12.405846800230398
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	11.500253699898016
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self - consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	11.49232146263718
She was very equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	11.796350628066817
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	9.215691186141958
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.	12.585580501416356
And when you have given _your_ ball,"she added,"I shall insist on their giving one also.	11.282680880983362
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations'behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	11.525207188729876
The day passed much as the day before had done.	12.722649650534146
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room.	11.991840757834028
The loo table, however, did not appear.	12.279513732215804
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.	10.59278991140976
Hurst was observing their game.	7.504954277098038
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.	9.978328849043914
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	11.628186363171569
"You write uncommonly fast.""You are mistaken.	8.999624344150579
I write rather slowly.""How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!""It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.""Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.""I have already told her so once, by your desire.""I am afraid you do not like your pen.	10.180955702748204
I mend pens remarkably well.""Thank you - - but I always mend my own.""How can you contrive to write so even?"He was silent.	11.026795417957292
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.""Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? - - At present I have not room to do them justice.""Oh! it is of no consequence.	11.189615089407688
But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?""They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.""It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill.""That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,"cried her brother - -"because he does _not_ write with ease.	11.197274710763875
He studies too much for words of four syllables. - - Do not you, Darcy?""My style of writing is very different from yours.""Oh!"cried Miss Bingley,"Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.	9.23741864452017
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.""My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them - - by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.""Your humility, Mr. Bingley,"said Elizabeth,"must disarm reproof.""Nothing is more deceitful,"said Darcy,"than the appearance of humility.	9.113653070076845
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.""And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?""The indirect boast; - - for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.	8.835894596405154
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.	11.811381035315794
When you told Mrs.	9.399395732785502
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself - - and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?""Nay,"cried Bingley,"this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.	11.722711623370465
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.	14.866922888975687
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.""I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.	10.431848617411875
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,'you would probably do it, you would probably not go - - and, at another word, might stay a month.""You have only proved by this,"cried Elizabeth,"that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.	12.367735733425707
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.""Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?""Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself.""You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.	9.419196527274247
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.""To yield readily - - easily - - to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you.""To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.""You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.	10.83862780366584
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.	7.506656164319735
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley.	11.841828721007099
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.	8.674611518231563
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?""Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?""By all means,"cried Bingley;"let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.	10.487170000478335
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	12.036293707575258
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.	9.475615371504338
Arguments are too much like disputes.	10.24706098651191
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.""What you ask,"said Elizabeth,"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter."Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	11.23311459078449
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.	14.33855278579754
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.	12.602635553929437
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.	9.314484942272747
The supposition did not pain her.	12.040269230188207
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.	10.693362243111387
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her - -"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"She smiled, but made no answer.	10.430832989983736
He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.	13.365321973115442
"Oh!"said she,"I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.	11.825963204301175
You wanted me, I know, to say'Yes,'that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.	11.929898299443918
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.	17.563242300364685
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	12.242199104815416
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	9.803236758231602
"I hope,"said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day,"you will give your mother - in - law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. - - And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.""Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?""Oh! yes. - - Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.	9.110306393280004
Put them next to your great uncle the judge.	8.768605262799442
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.	11.366679446547284
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.	17.317341441576474
"I did not know that you intended to walk,"said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	13.39388256516803
"You used us abominably ill,"answered Mrs.	9.889487549944072
Hurst,"in running away without telling us that you were coming out."Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.	10.088258332313195
The path just admitted three.	7.507232157528484
Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said, - -"This walk is not wide enough for our party.	10.12079753840026
We had better go into the avenue."But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,"No, no; stay where you are. - - You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.	10.977493388085378
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	6.395877784084883
Good bye."She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.	12.067852268572828
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing - room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	10.550298699052398
Their powers of conversation were considerable.	8.825880111305445
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.	6.737028248601531
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	12.295939894612749
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was"very glad;"but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	9.656609964762152
He was full of joy and attention.	8.585835304113347
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	13.461297086369264
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.	11.455972047087108
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.	13.158765990714238
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? - - I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.""If you mean Darcy,"cried her brother,"he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins - - but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards.""I should like balls infinitely better,"she replied,"if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	10.922145746609258
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; - - but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	13.085351746604479
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. - - I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	11.475146340934478
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.	14.047019534686404
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	10.945213085032856
He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.	9.166583739633499
"What could he mean?	11.239718690321096
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,"said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.	10.416470081941934
How shall we punish him for such a speech?""Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,"said Elizabeth.	11.248292448799019
"We can all plague and punish one another.	6.221995154125822
Teaze him - - laugh at him. - - Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.""But upon my honour I do _not_.	14.73171089633074
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.	9.923675942055592
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no - - I feel he may defy us there.	8.74437555818889
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	11.62816283335449
Mr. Darcy may hug himself.""Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!"cried Elizabeth.	9.76991086325751
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	12.622472161782925
I dearly love a laugh.""Miss Bingley,"said he,"has given me credit for more than can be.	11.182745036627214
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.	10.053281055512059
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.""Such as vanity and pride.""Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	8.354733212396678
But pride - - where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	10.383248159518743
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,"said Miss Bingley; - -"and pray what is the result?""I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.	11.133840871943034
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	16.691058311428165
My temper I dare not vouch for. - - It is I believe too little yielding - - certainly too little for the convenience of the world.	11.000566726565902
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.	7.6381079904218305
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	8.172374884372438
But you have chosen your fault well. - - I really cannot _laugh_ at it.	9.441101867457721
You are safe from me.""There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.""And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body.""And yours,"he replied with a smile,"is wilfully to misunderstand them.""Do let us have a little music,"- - cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. - -"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst."Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano - forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.	10.750602301673792
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	10.05359271465196
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.	15.059966894138979
But Mrs.	9.83933839115461
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	15.185622674475995
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. - - Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved - - nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	11.63803276401509
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her - - that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.	13.656060591903906
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence - - Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.	14.631758960164102
She attracted him more than he liked - - and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	10.72709043866531
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.	8.527071413312045
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.	12.871241701656785
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. - - Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	12.264072443610823
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	7.737580773096247
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. - - But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	14.038740986445111
The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.	13.700124979394642
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread - bare morality to listen to.	8.014752552676633
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.	15.54035419363276
Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.	12.2912505631065
"I hope, my dear,"said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning,"that you have ordered a good dinner to - day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.""Who do you mean, my dear?	11.736465630787174
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.	9.738697121208846
Bennet's eyes sparkled. - -"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure.	10.82614237766561
Why Jane - - you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. - - But - - good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day.	9.571266079556366
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.	11.377723586542443
I must speak to Hill, this moment.""It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,"said her husband;"it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	11.81769471714625
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	11.735040297091773
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.	10.894189230077407
It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.""Oh! my dear,"cried his wife,"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	10.734175677578381
Pray do not talk of that odious man.	14.449496466191913
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	11.577048050806331
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	11.755224431712366
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.""No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	14.852992578724049
I hate such false friends.	8.55180710911248
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?""Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, <NUM> th <URL> DEAR SIR, The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance. - -"There, Mrs.	9.429554332082198
Bennet."- - My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.	7.840069290561209
As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	8.195360973692763
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends, - - but of this hereafter.	11.059118202974897
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well - wisher and friend, WILLIAM COLLINS.""At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace - making gentleman,"said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.	8.470119422505443
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.""There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.""Though it is difficult,"said Jane,"to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.	10.29853721693602
There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter, which promises well.	9.860160744185563
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.	10.845501980293903
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	12.511242965507979
As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill - will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.	14.022518830942662
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.	12.035843446648022
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	7.9681813482187795
His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.	10.478511152657125
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.	9.020644688111801
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	11.433097938777815
Things are settled so oddly.""You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.""Ah! sir, I do indeed.	10.648602741183554
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.	10.75598504491822
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.	13.086954515298997
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.""I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, - - and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.	9.930092746831546
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.	11.241617226040413
At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted - - - -"He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.	11.120942902065272
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.	11.186654886116218
The hall, the dining - room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.	10.066085051955145
Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.	13.358854936176023
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.	9.69657196454308
But here he was set right by Mrs.	8.8730249261644
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	14.076055145401346
He begged pardon for having displeased her.	7.426225250936624
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.	8.66094145931069
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	12.897851353530326
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.	11.289342249178365
Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.	9.485192191485753
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank - - such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.	10.062852468712338
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.	9.445908604815818
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.	9.843041941781713
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	8.56336913950519
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself, - - some shelves in the closets up stairs.	9.645686344741742
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,"said Mrs.	8.268260328618826
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.	9.34315428706288
Does she live near you, sir?""The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.""I think you said she was a widow, sir?	10.07262923169615
has she any family?""She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.""Ah!"cried Mrs.	9.878093720030863
And what sort of young lady is she?	11.599352303957998
is she handsome?""She is a most charming young lady indeed.	10.902112872729559
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.	9.671686367894283
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.	8.515013764052382
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.""Has she been presented?	8.535951032246539
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.""Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.	8.79011630100488
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.	9.71725467093757
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?""They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.	8.42310378802292
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.	10.849035199621117
Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. - - Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. - - Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	9.74681926801782
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	9.419449735794553
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.	11.10057949369547
I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	8.864692994024656
It amazes me, I confess; - - for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.	11.23909058094347
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.	9.029298817456574
Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	7.388301055493227
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.	8.867704199690097
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.	9.33492675134585
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self - importance and humility.	9.95119793905431
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	11.872658344301447
This was his plan of amends - - of atonement - - for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.	10.333340508111137
His plan did not vary on seeing them. - - Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.	10.1779023165705
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête - à - tête with Mrs.	9.005826613375309
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. - -"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say - - she could not positively answer - - but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; - - her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention - - she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth - - and it was soon done - - done while Mrs.	12.518989699154348
Bennet was stirring the fire.	7.366926204577953
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	9.7626390877645
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.	13.107298725672774
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.	11.455040287094306
Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.	10.072493479302393
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.	11.128184187115105
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.	9.887275723926855
The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.	11.264573156025
All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.	9.368751940122042
Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.	10.607995757977601
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	14.48849748968818
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation - - a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.	7.937006258946427
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.	14.181850681137542
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.	9.936586903086303
Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat - - a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.	8.043787842283916
What could be the meaning of it? - - It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.	14.068191223849729
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	9.271501923258919
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	11.528185860862727
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.	11.824468332161008
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the - - - - shire.	10.382928908512419
Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	7.273784472921573
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.	8.603158783259948
Bennet by admiring Mrs.	6.883743656008608
Philips's manners and politeness.	10.537460749456871
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.	11.118859754414167
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs.	10.714967423817264
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing - room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.	10.614540629399121
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.	10.31015101984066
Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing - rooms, and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.	11.930790786066078
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.	9.899286924936305
Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.	11.071784567927768
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.	11.450136182061495
It was over at last however.	13.433477860564377
The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	12.293660408739559
The officers of the - - - - shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman - like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	10.701000123105647
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.	9.386585169383311
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.	10.980045666767136
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	9.066935268196657
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.	10.268384099773645
"I know little of the game, at present,"said he,"but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life - - - -"Mrs.	13.327854508069372
Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	14.951274603496493
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.	10.619098850522114
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.	8.767512396019978
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.	13.854650342373962
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.	7.770250535361169
A clear ten thousand per annum.	6.953331296440217
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself - - for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	11.372705328368077
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. - - Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?""As much as I ever wish to be,"cried Elizabeth warmly, - -"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.""I have no right to give _my_ opinion,"said Wickham,"as to his being agreeable or otherwise.	12.610139080302917
I am not qualified to form one.	8.178637408246468
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.	11.011804980790322
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - - and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. - - Here you are in your own family.""Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	11.316069480228872
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.	13.199914082926409
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	10.65905403342261
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.""I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill - tempered man."Wickham only shook his head.	11.45182320804452
"I wonder,"said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.	14.59968255777008
I hope your plans in favour of the - - - - shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.""Oh! no - - it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.	11.801955752017363
If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	11.46473032210271
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.	11.752839851956248
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,"he added,"which was my chief inducement to enter the - - - - shire.	11.511375903751656
Society, I own, is necessary to me.	21.29213296548269
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.	12.203347122995751
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.	13.537915052637228
The church _ought_ to have been my profession - - I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.""Indeed!""Yes - - the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.	12.330383734720138
He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.""Good heavens!"cried Elizabeth;"but how could _that_ be? - - How could his will be disregarded? - - Why did not you seek legal redress?""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.	11.013612611046426
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it - - or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	10.353325879370312
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.	11.803098183735862
I can recal nothing worse.	9.01550226336037
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.""This is quite shocking! - - He deserves to be publicly disgraced.""Some time or other he _will_ be - - but it shall not be by _me_.	11.27835112093805
Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.	11.373786097947516
"But what,"said she, after a pause,"can have been his motive? - - what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?""A thorough, determined dislike of me - - a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	9.921203148813355
Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.	10.550379051758657
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood - - the sort of preference which was often given me.""I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him - - I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued,"I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	11.11766373319759
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to - - but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.	13.512580942413297
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.	8.6797931852794
"How abominable! - - I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! - - If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, - - for dishonesty I must call it.""It _is_ wonderful,"- - replied Wickham, - -"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; - - and pride has often been his best friend.	11.707076615909461
It has often led him to be liberal and generous, - - to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.	10.29443442324221
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	10.974309492598577
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.""What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"He shook his head. - -"I wish I could call her amiable.	9.765013822918007
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.	11.571411770334988
But she is too much like her brother, - - very, very proud. - - As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.	12.733328932438617
But she is nothing to me now.	17.877271154726547
Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?	11.73608377884233
How can they suit each other? - - Do you know Mr. Bingley?""Not at all.""He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	10.665427284198028
He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.""Probably not; - - but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.	11.09314679261524
He does not want abilities.	11.728723326035162
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.	8.770716238370385
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	13.73571004382693
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal - minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable, - - allowing something for fortune and figure."The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.	8.658554416316122
It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.	12.747583601947479
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.	12.445761724082741
"I know very well, madam,"said he,"that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things, - - and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	10.84370487095794
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	9.363930471624728
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,"she replied,"has very lately given him a living.	9.833758448112292
I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.""You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.""No, indeed, I did not. - - I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections.	11.424067517184305
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.""Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.	13.070850405719142
"Mr. Collins,"said she,"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.""I believe her to be both in a great degree,"replied Wickham;"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	12.092004272477018
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.	10.8140857761847
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.	12.831942932706891
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.	13.595785936561027
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.	12.447975111113488
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	15.721340932201306
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs.	9.79482719480018
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.	11.792860746635172
Jane listened with astonishment and concern; - - she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. - - The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.	11.412920210530471
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.	9.189472449714277
It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.""Very true, indeed; - - and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? - - Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.""Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.	10.867210075003628
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, - - one, whom his father had promised to provide for. - - It is impossible.	11.216416582268334
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.	12.627756393629586
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?	9.745692992848655
oh! no.""I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony. - - If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.	9.957402846412956
Besides, there was truth in his looks.""It is difficult indeed - - it is distressing. - - One does not know what to think.""I beg your pardon; - - one knows exactly what to think."But Jane could think with certainty on only one point, - - that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.	10.901951684869474
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.	11.528154554131696
To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.	7.527494936972665
Bennet's civilities.	11.77324943337456
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.	13.14343489380861
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.	10.599013564973003
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.	10.897127351786411
"While I can have my mornings to myself,"said she,"it is enough. - - I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	10.623991174759993
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.	9.756817476922226
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances: - - and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed.	8.119263982849994
Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.	8.794447370153085
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. - - It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	9.519449208803454
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	11.185878852500103
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.	11.546256072290982
Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	10.36905395917499
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.	12.780175502865234
No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; - - the very shoe - roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.	8.719584992298369
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	9.331896286304998
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	8.87760898454692
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	8.428532499987837
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.	12.468609507257947
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.	12.941405147400515
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.	8.142142623602359
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.	11.24963437439631
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	12.684673099782994
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.	12.63826250667406
He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	9.997097774947708
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.""Heaven forbid! - - _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! - - To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! - - Do not wish me such an evil."When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	10.029026942120028
Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours'looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	9.934382310680732
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.	11.589507957335025
He replied, and was again silent.	16.448626964637153
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. - - _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.	12.27886196605681
"Very well. - - That reply will do for the present. - - Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. - - But _now_ we may be silent.""Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?""Sometimes.	9.378539754584446
One must speak a little, you know.	15.178831664300777
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?""Both,"replied Elizabeth archly;"for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. - - We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"said he.	10.698633352256056
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added,"When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."The effect was immediate.	10.03986130756322
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends - - whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.""He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,"replied Elizabeth with emphasis,"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	11.440489733887668
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.	9.784440133461976
Such very superior dancing is not often seen.	10.753435128144126
It is evident that you belong to the first circles.	13.57901004177938
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.""I do not think we were speaking at all.	12.064019103207222
"Books - - Oh! no. - - I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. - - We may compare our different opinions.""No - - I cannot talk of books in a ball - room; my head is always full of something else.""The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes - - does it?"said he, with a look of doubt.	11.282393313464858
"Yes, always,"she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.	10.903744044034866
"I do not get on at all.	9.970810290463204
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.	10.601686327750606
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.	12.461101891892692
His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.	13.226514704871661
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,"said Elizabeth angrily;"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.""I beg your pardon,"replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	11.718886453505458
"Excuse my interference. - - It was kindly meant.""Insolent girl!"said Elizabeth to herself. - -"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	10.385770823159012
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. - - Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	11.071014255818426
"I want to know,"said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's,"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.	12.22361411561677
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.""No,"replied Jane,"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.	11.893448690209835
Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	11.962292056436226
I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.""Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.""This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.	11.178637659160287
I am perfectly satisfied.	11.172380073818081
Mr. Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before."She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.	11.645329315026776
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.	11.049271780144158
On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.	12.290865150416547
"I have found out,"said he,"by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.	12.31290286671434
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.	9.985142393482123
How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with - - perhaps - - a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! - - I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	10.223481599656246
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.""You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?""Indeed I am.	9.704931699743048
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.	14.244665855140456
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. - - Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom - - provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.	10.167610165623145
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.	11.137716093895433
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself."And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.	8.962831857279163
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words"apology,""Hunsford,"and"Lady Catherine de Bourgh."- - It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.	12.491965914261451
Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.	9.666369190028067
Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	10.64733798065873
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	11.258630682367086
Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	10.867681188032101
He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	11.031926551715799
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.	10.471237749341034
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	10.44199620743558
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	9.760031118614197
When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley. - - It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	10.194220326959538
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.	9.234972403273943
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	11.881229155266738
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.	8.934563420942801
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.	8.651863166998396
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.	10.414115867762776
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?	15.18372869425786
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.""For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. - - What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? - - You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	11.410111526182524
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	13.311484090443065
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.	5.681334441777868
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	11.045156789228326
At length however Mrs.	7.479987445842588
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	9.77581032513607
Elizabeth now began to revive.	12.842840442206645
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.	9.425514290082212
By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, - - but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	9.07564660318786
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.	10.908915433571522
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. - - Elizabeth was in agonies.	11.76956626771465
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.	13.256246686531883
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.	9.52619051884991
She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.	7.614383034706802
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,"That will do extremely well, child.	9.980427879871852
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. - - Others of the party were now applied to.	14.584040485323516
"If I,"said Mr. Collins,"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. - - I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	11.610372613927815
The rector of a parish has much to do. - - In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.	11.13781746379273
He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.	10.813382098940194
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	8.01452836631977
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.	12.880199610263492
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	9.79438647478798
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	12.486869353377472
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.	13.061835121817005
There was no arguing upon such a project.	10.004998134000557
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good - naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.	10.192191102110774
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	10.823822663738135
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.	13.000992622037963
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs.	10.670346661443594
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	9.112359698844857
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs.	6.445051752114473
Darcy said nothing at all.	11.594054447259813
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.	12.908407259332956
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of"Lord, how tired I am!"accompanied by a violent yawn.	9.7205710460034
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.	7.768281320957495
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	12.187769720785942
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.	13.02760535261864
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.	8.239206304263709
Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.	7.295639808893509
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	12.754903217687179
On finding Mrs.	9.154150285888356
Bennet instantly answered,"Oh dear! - - Yes - - certainly. - - I am sure Lizzy will be very happy - - I am sure she can have no objection. - - Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs."And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,"Dear Ma'am, do not go. - - I beg you will not go. - - Mr. Collins must excuse me. - - He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	12.15517745226236
I am going away myself.""No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. - - I desire you will stay where you are."- - And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added,"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction - - and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.	9.98038042729424
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.	12.356650177301072
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	9.391125221878715
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.	9.363216264360648
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	8.834243841550236
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.	10.550164579427857
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying - - and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.	9.466044891724318
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly - - which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	11.253941281983714
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford - - between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.	8.664000310417569
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot - stool, that she said,'Mr. Collins, you must marry.	10.199351256312736
This is my advice.	13.375314569117899
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.	12.38188622510702
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	9.728292476204702
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.	9.267784277871026
But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place - - which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.	11.558708892376092
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	12.120954140259743
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	8.850683499647918
"You are too hasty, Sir,"she cried.	10.38844951944877
Let me do it without farther loss of time.	9.656559178725919
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.	12.146619715353728
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.""Upon my word, Sir,"cried Elizabeth,"your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.	9.139743615630652
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.	9.492809154385437
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.	10.09159950791687
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self - reproach.	9.801675994380798
This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled."And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.""Really, Mr. Collins,"cried Elizabeth with some warmth,"you puzzle me exceedingly.	12.133222296522291
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.""You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	10.45365664721495
My reasons for believing it are briefly these: - - It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.	9.38457929038058
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	10.615533574649358
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	7.50352529324963
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	11.163145981575422
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.	11.769106416602822
My feelings in every respect forbid it.	9.222455550774095
Can I speak plainer?	9.518701174591769
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart.""You are uniformly charming!"cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry;"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	9.65441845908545
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.	11.219656728084422
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast - room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	9.461017087847049
This information, however, startled Mrs.	10.076491655540348
Bennet; - - she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.	11.916501665244626
"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,"she added,"that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.	10.379572202070712
I will speak to her about it myself directly.	15.111278934602776
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it.""Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,"cried Mr. Collins;"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	12.593137777888897
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.""Sir, you quite misunderstand me,"said Mrs.	9.24070372819367
Bennet, alarmed.	13.417159509054649
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.	9.410724597177008
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.	11.061889200929265
I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	12.907390813145721
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,"said he, when she had finished her speech.	11.05977366141101
"Of what are you talking?""Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.	11.037860393999006
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.""And what am I to do on the occasion? - - It seems an hopeless business.""Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.	11.341220358772075
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.""Let her be called down.	10.199712015051816
She shall hear my opinion."Mrs.	10.176981197102766
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.	12.957059319830108
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.	10.10437611106603
Is it true?"Elizabeth replied that it was.	14.537174436714677
"Very well - - and this offer of marriage you have refused?""I have, Sir.""Very well.	10.90740010030248
We now come to the point.	15.964673220858378
Your mother insists upon your accepting it.	6.777239975282008
Is not it so, Mrs.	13.482588460130067
Bennet?""Yes, or I will never see her again.""An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.	12.322745059131709
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. - - Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_."Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs.	11.099464446751531
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	12.349529602470026
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?	11.6020523852012
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.""My dear,"replied her husband,"I have two small favours to request.	9.43916124167362
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	15.852160334449827
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.	14.746241120361233
She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.	7.485647588306571
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering; - - and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	8.989894603925249
Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.	10.690604650907384
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	8.087037852318455
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.	9.53765169483297
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	11.17539432305516
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.	13.805003546871857
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper,"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! - - What do you think has happened this morning? - - Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room, where Mrs.	12.579954851081816
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.	12.093638066501931
"Aye, there she comes,"continued Mrs.	12.272168281719624
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. - - Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.	9.782238876262156
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.	8.809646497899875
Those who do not complain are never pitied."Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	7.109574060950996
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.	12.892364696983723
In a doleful voice Mrs.	6.251261654306854
Bennet thus began the projected conversation. - -"Oh! Mr. Collins!"- -"My dear Madam,"replied he,"let us be for ever silent on this point.	11.984373951533332
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.	10.677724732655122
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	7.992036821586036
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	8.903611842286633
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	7.722422235773741
But we are all liable to error.	9.132822439220863
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	10.546035611757604
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	10.76521960364148
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	8.761859797986968
He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.	13.296703382333268
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.	5.420671347493077
Bennet's ill humour or ill health.	7.452329928628423
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.	11.642786946916821
He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	11.407408934893272
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	11.194625423252063
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over. - - To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	10.99023384298088
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	10.822713174229678
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	8.703991512524382
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	10.244275856654985
When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.	11.205709290738179
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	11.020744731827154
You shall hear what she says."She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.	11.634870822690175
The next was in these words.	11.584291730040155
"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.	9.30256007342909
"It is unlucky,"said she, after a short pause,"that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.	10.69137845071201
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? - - Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.""Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.	9.729256699900741
I will read it to you - -"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	11.450343622055929
It must be his own doing. - - He is his own master.	16.885419533377817
But you do not know _all_.	12.335443115181556
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.	6.374598036319005
I will have no reserves from _you_.""Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.	9.402844032195388
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.	9.558590968497182
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.	10.172091225780116
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?""What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"- - said Jane as she finished it.	10.860819541382703
"Is it not clear enough? - - Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?	10.003320298517727
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?""Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. - - Will you hear it?""Most willingly.""You shall have it in few words.	10.772584356313887
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.	14.685639238085924
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."Jane shook her head.	12.635452338371035
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. - - No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.	13.134738172638107
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.	13.19338858100729
She is not such a simpleton.	16.650001327279547
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	11.554396455556114
But the case is this.	12.642137080582357
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.	11.84435445342623
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.""If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"replied Jane,"your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	11.08864192543178
But I know the foundation is unjust.	9.575639355025112
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.""That is right. - - You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.	10.941001304106829
A thousand things may arise in six months!"The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.	9.472389667506723
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.	9.434903690933686
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	10.562696132415756
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	11.607405774119883
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	10.826560175370885
After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.	12.487830497151098
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.	12.93663096259439
"It keeps him in good humour,"said she,"and I am more obliged to you than I can express."Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	13.391994477029302
This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; - - its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.	10.998968183894997
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.	12.022140274679563
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	10.781102814416263
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	8.41340893727437
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	11.701466335603408
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.	8.317399203207367
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	9.783149227106955
Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.	9.1291142609281
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's.	10.368448168563837
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	8.886025088983764
The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.	7.4146580680912475
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	8.682990841296675
She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	11.812003480179373
Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.	10.31904181907752
But still he would be her husband. - - Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.	8.514757392025803
This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty - seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	11.138160618412991
The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.	12.126638359923852
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.	12.955131173701838
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	12.75815836000176
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.	11.705377209676262
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	10.8762310733667
"My dear Madam,"he replied,"this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? - - You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness.""My dear sir,"replied Mr. Collins,"I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.""You cannot be too much on your guard.	10.260664091920441
As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	9.080348612247999
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	12.363548556670418
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.	9.970642322062368
"I see what you are feeling,"replied Charlotte, - -"you must be surprised, very much surprised, - - so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.	13.323755246148021
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.	16.355937220025638
I am not romantic you know.	8.466852176772774
I never was.	13.842501985047244
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."Elizabeth quietly answered"Undoubtedly;"- - and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.	11.16440196013572
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	14.443003907368004
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.	11.36115456336873
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.	9.64195963198241
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture! - - And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.	11.451982025872416
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	10.745912177336743
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.	9.67163317803048
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	12.277990185034806
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	11.199287585486942
Nothing could console and nothing appease her. - - Nor did that day wear out her resentment.	8.276144554790143
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	12.621029796246562
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.	10.755275867186153
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.	8.234369767579992
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.	11.056066411234227
Bennet's sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.	8.644232097064746
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	9.106242456172094
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	9.988607399658825
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	10.677681918196358
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.	10.12353643290705
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.	8.474181980780363
Bennet.	12.110967658241837
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.	6.3024725765243055
Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.	11.629914518754163
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.	9.145555464907323
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.	10.743845148385521
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.	10.992922428322764
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	11.086940067572813
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.	10.973423956216482
He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company.	13.331224178198493
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	12.233766206837133
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	14.161811366940006
As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	10.705710837187933
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.	12.190183842495788
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"said she,"it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!""My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	11.205950673711344
Let us hope for better things.	7.501095894847471
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	14.270306188455056
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it.""What should not you mind?""I should not mind any thing at all.""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.""I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.	13.065893263644286
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! - - Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?""I leave it to yourself to determine,"said Mr. Bennet.	11.030409948827813
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	11.774712557651265
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.	10.59050812777177
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.	11.840055973158348
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.	9.884129980718717
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.	9.018204584545582
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.	10.57224113938067
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	11.680367908934446
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.	10.066373211035343
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.	12.087137478807463
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	14.834530440601355
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends'interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	10.241729606373775
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.	11.695460300827602
Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	9.68431841148633
But I will not repine.	11.564710076319264
It cannot last long.	9.379202553107234
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.	15.296648291060093
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.	12.634770406645359
Thank God! I have not _that_ pain.	11.985089053119948
A little time therefore. - - I shall certainly try to get the better."With a stronger voice she soon added,"I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself.""My dear Jane!"exclaimed Elizabeth,"you are too good.	11.58639548635093
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.	8.12857284858368
"Nay,"said Elizabeth,"this is not fair.	13.535675188505854
_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.	16.093309320155658
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.	9.60602979865932
You need not.	12.240536443975799
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.	12.246415682171149
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.	12.344656024838866
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.	10.973401624157127
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.	8.73134785567661
Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.	11.629844458416603
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.""To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.	13.520636140408815
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.	15.855098496253731
You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.""I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"replied Jane,"and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.	9.563353946073063
But enough of this.	15.063187358652295
You alluded to something else.	9.121061486513979
You mentioned _two_ instances.	8.510556171697628
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.	10.941821440279751
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.	9.985811220088573
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.	7.801910801198098
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.""And do you impute it to either of those?""Yes; to the last.	12.4588713931328
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.	10.217027039447942
Stop me whilst you can.""You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.""Yes, in conjunction with his friend.""I cannot believe it.	10.861892213244877
Why should they try to influence him?	9.88791089378636
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.""Your first position is false.	10.28664453945265
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.""Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,"replied Jane;"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	9.983769776310437
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.	8.788820196924995
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.	11.381979690161767
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?	9.520991915354555
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	13.21593146068237
By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.	10.743674816646516
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken - - or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	12.227879832397798
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	13.174183628957353
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.	10.213009267066216
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	12.386763043714156
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.	13.16996113195374
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.	9.767781523883679
"So, Lizzy,"said he one day,"your sister is crossed in love I find.	11.725420418608852
I congratulate her.	13.090485222525396
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	13.719581807407321
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.	12.307544384437438
When is your turn to come?	14.289444380106703
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.	10.5333389162801
Now is your time.	15.842968760480447
Let Wickham be _your_ man.	9.105129233086547
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.""True,"said Mr. Bennet,"but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.	9.985345123666782
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.	11.66456930527972
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.	12.623426835506223
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes - - but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	8.59621057086002
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.	8.276721914132175
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	12.094225793498278
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.	9.452256610955452
On the following Monday, Mrs.	7.959424280685185
Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman - like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	10.774155672148432
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.	11.12822781150716
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.	8.021862269727952
Bennet and Mrs.	9.338605085108181
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	13.448938851736477
Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.	11.36657612181246
They had frequently been staying with her in town.	10.930292910460047
The first part of Mrs.	10.28313825566816
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	8.196584937059074
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.	12.25773983789084
It became her turn to listen.	9.525522771481041
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	10.587634094323889
They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister.	9.794644210417363
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.	18.176121969871996
"I do not blame Jane,"she continued,"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could.	13.691482791064029
But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.	13.029737801100818
He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.	11.70535033197687
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.	13.404114042368892
The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.	9.256814886124074
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.	15.145583408232788
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."Mrs.	11.048377071013219
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	11.746321643340186
"I am sorry it went off.	7.746003880350256
But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.""An excellent consolation in its way,"said Elizabeth,"but it will not do for _us_.	10.574820658196774
We do not suffer by _accident_.	10.636222817488495
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.""But that expression of'violently in love'is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	9.947057479223561
He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	8.767840144030536
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	10.644870888678984
Could there be finer symptoms?	9.28581008184077
Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.	15.27796435454492
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?	13.240928960846546
Change of scene might be of service - - and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.	11.004205267798602
"I hope,"added Mrs.	12.190898954426965
Gardiner,"that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.	10.537809380116245
We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.""And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it?	12.496900689394407
Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.""So much the better.	8.659979618928235
I hope they will not meet at all.	11.960456833760613
_She_ will not be able to help calling.""She will drop the acquaintance entirely."But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	11.57525623711674
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re - animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.	12.455316059179168
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.	13.674978215979184
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.	12.830756070651438
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.	12.73492975427993
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.	11.457429502875378
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	7.5287982212367055
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.	13.685288385682693
To Mrs.	12.162078755157799
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.	9.111808480266415
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.	11.409041636779815
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.	8.789302120107743
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.	8.758921022739397
On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill - natured boy.	10.498683182870344
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.	10.42622043993236
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.	16.239885787660295
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.	10.923254168358426
I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.	13.399257566176217
But as it is - - you must not let your fancy run away with you.	13.504013247969613
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.	8.883387601659543
You must not disappoint your father.""My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.""Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.""Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	10.945278253225855
I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.	13.282887285600012
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.""Elizabeth, you are not serious now.""I beg your pardon.	12.891078500731235
I will try again.	10.66192738408755
At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	15.478506346470052
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not.	12.82279492799831
I see the imprudence of it. - - Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! - - My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	10.591849415675439
My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.	13.590057900156092
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?	10.339002156054592
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.	11.459257480169832
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him.""As I did the other day,"said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile;"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	10.71324361085583
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.	14.334458365130843
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.	9.775125253620242
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.	11.887316782500736
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied."Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.	13.891823070262664
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.	11.549479274950253
Bennet.	12.110967658241837
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she"_wished_ they might be happy."Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.	11.38888215798924
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.""_That_ you certainly shall.""And I have another favour to ask.	10.910869394488973
Will you come and see me?""We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.""I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.	11.8183649762335
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.	13.883250049330998
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March,"added Charlotte,"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.	13.779396124727771
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.	11.719711556003121
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.	11.843523506970378
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	12.246501897295348
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.	9.103689824609221
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.	13.295553057027771
It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.	12.42909737836218
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	13.204771957765745
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.	11.453603306208707
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.	14.568178922899898
"My aunt,"she continued,"is going to - morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor - street."She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	12.224100885846038
"I did not think Caroline in spirits,"were her words,"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.	13.072288808177502
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	10.944208484818457
He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	13.804496094807648
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	13.896563633546918
I wish I could see her.	13.234443211630385
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.	14.887189136888455
Hurst were going out.	9.683485820199637
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.	10.437191859831119
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.	12.1446909584022
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.	10.757181420298863
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.	12.618259783390787
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	14.23543285988107
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.	10.075862639020372
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	9.716559714410499
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.	11.963800889351381
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.	12.237873898850598
When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	12.783556547059275
I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.	11.278560351515829
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.	10.228899177238564
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.	15.032095010493018
I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	12.617014353253753
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.	12.841133666831698
I cannot understand it.	10.714312094307669
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.	11.079938779597885
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	11.716747920156028
Let me hear from you very soon.	9.93497325111695
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.	13.97117035244741
We had better not mention it.	10.95515801070943
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.	16.75922851419842
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.	10.409905978120772
"Your's, & c."This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	9.379674452332528
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	12.577298893344667
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	13.93930094551947
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.	11.37495153921196
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.	10.310337753507344
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.	9.48083532162841
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: - -"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.	10.231682040513887
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.	14.536209890781262
There can be no love in all this.	12.48529160002876
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	12.323959941394708
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.	9.75285876407428
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.	9.707370710625998
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.	16.75169912649029
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.	8.9831730584763
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.	11.894280176596332
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	10.845893964094723
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.	11.599142369700736
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	14.222833004024993
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her - - their opinion of every body - - would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	11.297964033287428
Her fellow - travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.	11.251120315038225
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty - headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.	11.825377576558443
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.	12.393750944636281
It was a journey of only twenty - four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch - street by noon.	9.387062015416221
As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.	10.498252467562287
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	9.43238001400966
All was joy and kindness.	9.356639821339806
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	9.8197697388571
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	12.329821997157257
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.	10.325381995989904
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	8.885524625144125
"But, my dear Elizabeth,"she added,"what sort of girl is Miss King?	11.385964309179585
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.""Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	10.107621988894627
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	11.0311198846345
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.""If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.""She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.	12.632120251613555
I know no harm of her.""But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune.""No - - why should he?	11.163218169614623
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?""But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event.""A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.	10.062934010338026
If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?""_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	9.299532371924732
It only shews her being deficient in something herself - - sense or feeling.""Well,"cried Elizabeth,"have it as you choose.	10.392332717834528
_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.""No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.	13.390167138335997
I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.""Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.	11.903186931129488
I am sick of them all.	11.705974138427905
Thank Heaven! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	9.865052952136294
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.""Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	10.27305786952138
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,"said Mrs.	8.974739944148153
Gardiner,"but perhaps to the Lakes."No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	14.683080324249394
"My dear, dear aunt,"she rapturously cried,"what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.	8.132709298560004
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.	6.931371406455991
What are men to rocks and mountains?	6.367286016770346
Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	10.155745913922228
Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.	7.685856020591715
Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	10.620378876231895
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	11.363406225235142
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.	6.870289891484705
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	15.605051181150255
The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.	11.312697335021976
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.	10.23571412402728
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.	12.315324695194626
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.	13.056442441615017
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	10.495728086541897
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	10.802931068692617
When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.	10.450847584200451
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	11.811384164067913
He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	9.420265715289505
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.	10.16364922797685
It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.	6.441342784960662
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.	9.621330581373805
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	9.235547115747845
When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.	12.642177315589803
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	11.124768878089998
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed,"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.	11.683859500338368
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.	10.857437372048642
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.	13.499315035782683
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.	10.556879319885246
I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.""Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"added Charlotte,"and a most attentive neighbour.""Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.	13.030997220300701
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.	10.793068741622207
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.	7.5074555019441656
A lively imagination soon settled it all.	8.869746561354097
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	11.894778176106891
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining - room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.	11.630586549984727
Make haste, and come down this moment."Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining - room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.	10.284865956129602
"And is this all?"cried Elizabeth.	10.382719148182533
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!""La! my dear,"said Maria quite shocked at the mistake,"it is not Lady Catherine.	12.402729793453025
The old lady is Mrs.	7.665162794311257
Jenkinson, who lives with them.	12.43431402038879
The other is Miss De Bourgh.	9.185116734392446
Only look at her.	14.367241502297398
She is quite a little creature.	14.454294588181343
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!""She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	9.925369431476932
Why does she not come in?""Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	10.430209399261543
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in.""I like her appearance,"said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	8.926108297696059
"She looks sickly and cross. - - Yes, she will do for him very well.	12.39325665593904
She will make him a very proper wife."Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.	11.973194731423783
Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.	8.744011913169867
Mr. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	9.156594597795744
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	11.458257399390918
"I confess,"said he,"that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.	10.871872692413634
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.	15.159204659109452
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!""I am the less surprised at what has happened,"replied Sir William,"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	8.959215951581342
About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.	10.822964414869677
Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	10.790834939425924
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	9.87493882953587
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.	8.173243669042385
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.	10.806650824892637
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.	10.708954252323903
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. - - Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	9.264016611226765
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. - - Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	10.85696055798783
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.	8.04353398777291
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti - chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.	9.794567986403857
Jenkinson were sitting. - - Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.	10.206881304069533
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.	13.747092727736273
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	10.452215086391911
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. - - Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly - marked features, which might once have been handsome.	11.137225795047497
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	11.419312109276273
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self - importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.	13.368811898061592
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.	11.341043848970285
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.	8.077116209519938
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.	11.718126211528695
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.	10.908342680167106
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.	8.098062455011748
The party did not supply much conversation.	11.483053385650305
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh - - the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.	11.142633599110422
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	12.47316565938406
When the ladies returned to the drawing - room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.	10.846454816940733
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.	11.848783197767359
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.	9.596767495270937
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.	9.421458914925681
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.	12.435042518305275
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	11.171111410090754
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? - - Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. - - Lady Catherine then observed,"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.	12.393962465113779
For your sake,"turning to Charlotte,"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. - - It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. - - Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?""A little.""Oh! then - - some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	10.381117053647875
Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to - - - - You shall try it some day. - - Do your sisters play and sing?""One of them does.""Why did not you all learn? - - You ought all to have learned.	11.083067640683701
The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's. - - Do you draw?""No, not at all.""What, none of you?""Not one.""That is very strange.	11.059176400100414
But I suppose you had no opportunity.	14.82058313525054
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.""My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.""Has your governess left you?""We never had any governess.""No governess! How was that possible?	10.821716969188493
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.	12.315479255594783
"Then, who taught you?	14.352578269428369
who attended to you?	20.439138010566747
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.""Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.	10.543087840162386
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	9.28935476599272
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.	8.656030122683857
Four nieces of Mrs.	8.329684790701698
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.	10.268857826508476
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?	10.40620370664669
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	5.394762585684484
'Lady Catherine,'said she,'you have given me a treasure.'Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?""Yes, Ma'am, all.""All! - - What, all five out at once?	11.02558792419458
Very odd! - - And you only the second. - - The younger ones out before the elder are married! - - Your younger sisters must be very young?""Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	10.75359609102647
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. - - The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.	10.107832913157191
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, - - therefore you need not conceal your age.""I am not one and twenty."When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.	10.865715593348268
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.	9.603593300854856
Jenkinson to make up her party.	12.48233376881801
Their table was superlatively stupid.	6.52262071219457
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.	9.094102244727978
A great deal more passed at the other table.	12.468318296636447
Lady Catherine was generally speaking - - stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	9.702551523168943
Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	8.924857188795324
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.	5.05422003019788
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.	9.642779012926974
Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	12.243554411348281
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands.	10.31930528369078
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.	12.425153945215024
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	11.88412083808086
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	11.180663770571279
From the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.	10.815764253736681
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes'conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	10.643825678596388
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.	12.894105548259985
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.	12.057348337957462
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.	9.516798254181701
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.	9.729813666978163
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.	10.320172374783207
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses'reach.	10.721955666702584
This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.	11.716296756689255
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	9.78962343860865
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.	13.177054530088302
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.	12.023608330273374
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.	6.5021861766955995
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord - - - - and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	11.641135836400899
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.	12.229750315803315
Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door - bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	9.304118721284047
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.	11.239045092368768
Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.	10.82867870010724
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	9.65336751426138
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.	9.85163143313367
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	9.986525652893711
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.	13.988412409953602
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	10.31266206362156
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.	13.66859557922732
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter - day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.	11.875083206798063
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.	12.003010832246282
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.	11.98968696173824
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.	12.040369066911701
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.	9.88597472491809
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	14.977014947703976
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud.	6.270282078803081
It is of all subjects my delight.	10.37708450283901
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	15.515048154198025
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	9.923838829429485
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	10.448944265655117
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,"said Lady Catherine;"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal.""I assure you, Madam,"he replied,"that she does not need such advice.	11.536410602725667
She practises very constantly.""So much the better.	8.23192696706133
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	12.866745954052593
I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.	10.318282399695816
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.	10.6314431675126
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	11.350562148955095
He drew a chair near her.	8.471842046550512
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.	10.714871578658435
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?	13.441942819611073
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	8.306525143826203
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.	10.951152763323723
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.	11.125735618524859
Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire - - and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too - - for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.""I am not afraid of you,"said he, smilingly.	11.334635664634092
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.	12.358527717629855
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball - - and at this ball, what do you think he did?	16.745060600109127
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	10.05425993832564
Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.""I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.""True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	11.29088861169035
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	10.9579566863469
My fingers wait your orders.""Perhaps,"said Darcy,"I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.""Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.	9.020876903599477
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?""I can answer your question,"said Fitzwilliam,"without applying to him.	10.090578358782345
It is because he will not give himself the trouble.""I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"said Darcy,"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.	9.60369749893727
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.""My fingers,"said Elizabeth,"do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.	10.922677033339859
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault - - because I would not take the trouble of practising.	14.41452118894109
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."Darcy smiled and said,"You are perfectly right.	9.71025232970641
You have employed your time much better.	8.694530355125805
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	8.715392553793844
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.	13.132734575997594
She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.	9.751524731005759
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	11.109361441587296
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.	6.527791516914812
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.	12.638562612798605
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.	11.904803134558463
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.	10.517782091252666
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	12.006784749725309
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	7.799470074691936
It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.	11.68632570491577
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.""Perfectly so - - I thank you."She found that she was to receive no other answer - - and, after a short pause, added,"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?""I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	12.250490949206498
He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.""If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.	10.868856220187826
But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.""I should not be surprised,"said Darcy,"if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."Elizabeth made no answer.	13.542977685041842
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.	12.749684938494681
He took the hint, and soon began with,"This seems a very comfortable house.	12.663833427666766
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.""I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.""Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.""Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.	11.503655983141524
My friend has an excellent understanding - - though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.	10.760041306513033
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.""It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.""An easy distance do you call it?	11.580181666832397
It is nearly fifty miles.""And what is fifty miles of good road?	9.753754120706542
"I should never have said Mrs.	10.66072191816116
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.	13.60493903234364
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	12.166521987712631
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	7.540569319659723
But that is not the case _here_.	14.311584523173877
Mr. and Mrs.	6.0627138299018775
Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance."Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,"_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.	9.743441754353812
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn."Elizabeth looked surprised.	14.23044858204571
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,"Are you pleased with Kent?"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise - - and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.	10.232575897231516
"What can be the meaning of this!"said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.	14.611682925192929
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.	12.46957640834392
All field sports were over.	7.020563432015398
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.	12.577184041581479
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	10.685611963866819
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.	12.799306205985546
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.	14.070484642500189
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice - - a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	10.596350532601292
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Collins knew not what to make of him.	13.424398372690758
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.	10.823792880447751
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.	8.876463271019245
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.	10.632266892649623
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	11.942283669376609
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.	9.000734281439119
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. - - She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers. - - How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd! - - Yet it did, and even a third.	9.527559083455214
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs.	9.641156524010194
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	11.419004662560633
His words seemed to imply it.	8.672419959620312
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	12.43249212395951
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.	11.432916249868276
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re - perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.	9.571352269635343
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.""I have been making the tour of the Park,"he replied,"as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	11.510138502358217
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"said she.	9.388169810000326
He arranges the business just as he pleases.""And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.	12.558380237111255
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.""He likes to have his own way very well,"replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	10.96949016735473
"But so we all do.	11.270243783536271
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self - denial and dependence.""In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.	9.857461770409063
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?""These are home questions - - and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.	9.68392307910825
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.	9.993780727891805
Younger sons cannot marry where they like.""Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.""Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.""Is this,"thought Elizabeth,"meant for me?"and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone,"And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	11.353823891015665
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	12.777197919604818
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.	10.704340791878831
But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.""No,"said Colonel Fitzwilliam,"that is an advantage which he must divide with me.	12.45904217111569
Does your charge give you much trouble?	10.232885646247915
She directly replied,"You need not be frightened.	13.335698535778576
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	10.69565309112997
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.	11.602897866128783
Hurst and Miss Bingley.	9.334036640205325
I think I have heard you say that you know them.""I know them a little.	16.059798355865954
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man - - he is a great friend of Darcy's.""Oh! yes,"said Elizabeth drily - -"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.""Care of him! - - Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.	10.35528822042172
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.	12.968284500048066
It was all conjecture.""What is it you mean?""It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing.""You may depend upon my not mentioning it.""And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.	11.38013191222742
"He only told me, what I have now told you."Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.	12.648274066665806
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.	10.491696822230512
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	11.164516937591337
Why was he to be the judge?""You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?""I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.""But,"she continued, recollecting herself,"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	11.113170161942755
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.""That is not an unnatural surmise,"said Fitzwilliam,"but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.	10.364608398873806
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	12.253641181404264
There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence.	10.135153145055433
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.	10.298278212034747
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	13.313709791691247
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.	10.028773864118644
"To Jane herself,"she exclaimed,"there could be no possibility of objection.	14.443077807115793
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	10.599626082829985
Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach."When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.	11.573105465856093
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	10.775304925122562
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	5.60804999328748
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	11.726336372256972
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.	13.992950505658731
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	12.14736149443404
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	8.990843269494498
She answered him with cold civility.	10.414039461645032
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	9.69432599179936
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,"In vain have I struggled.	11.480634790790539
It will not do.	15.35543300110065
My feelings will not be repressed.	13.134859756516938
This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.	12.793235700365823
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.	12.402040471326872
His sense of her inferiority - - of its being a degradation - - of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.	11.09260793967184
She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.	12.296609633887797
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.	10.510895934320901
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.	14.709736221707095
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.	7.667216729490592
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.	10.901677716239655
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	11.582287628964737
But I cannot - - I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.	11.460167720927508
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.	10.8579509891515
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.	11.650504127517598
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.	9.161419795582303
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.	9.721664997313189
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.	11.66031133749846
But it is of small importance.""I might as well enquire,"replied she,"why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	11.105334886677163
But I have other provocations.	10.44312280634687
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	10.059123504770765
With assumed tranquillity he then replied,"I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	11.322950773988394
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself."Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	8.437362625918917
"But it is not merely this affair,"she continued,"on which my dislike is founded.	10.844491709974301
On this subject, what can you have to say?	18.36794436160294
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	6.942147369822236
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?""You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,"said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	9.767290839571206
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?""His misfortunes!"repeated Darcy contemptuously;"yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.""And of your infliction,"cried Elizabeth with energy.	9.971640367298816
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.	11.14440650783062
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.	11.722363150109896
You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.""And this,"cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully.	11.0896472450575
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,"added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her,"these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	9.719824341879207
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	9.547029861252607
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.	14.17242188918594
They were natural and just.	9.16107550657012
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner."She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	11.565359675381979
She went on.	14.960777740639807
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.""You have said quite enough, madam.	11.036677293741084
I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	16.33240425583645
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	12.206785685776717
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	8.136604313708638
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.	10.163572140479694
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.	11.564815384345625
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	9.738617514635282
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	10.619054721722698
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.	9.445471028178842
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.	13.51369515960124
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.	9.410661048347917
But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.	9.672288197435368
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.	12.328273687227766
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"- - And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.	13.023392894261464
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. - - The envelope itself was likewise full. - - Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	8.745252002116446
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	11.478685097098836
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	10.876310408090037
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.	15.736299993503845
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.	11.292907940695459
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. - - If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.	12.477118009587532
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. - - I will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. - - He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. - - The part which I acted, is now to be explained. - - His sisters'uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. - - We accordingly went - - and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice. - - I described, and enforced them earnestly. - - But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.	11.095156578505055
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. - - But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. - - To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.	11.3031569927672
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. - - I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.	10.568669197143638
I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. - - That they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. - - Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. - - It is done, however, and it was done for the best. - - On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.	12.80919614345302
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.	11.436951485415413
Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on George Wickham, who was his god - son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.	11.143930698779856
My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; - - most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	11.984444865371772
My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	12.092770665872397
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.	14.209253506919705
The vicious propensities - - the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	11.015860691533657
My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant.	10.710416689424836
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	6.537887422569122
His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.	11.235444240179813
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.	11.926424356431175
I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.	12.822655570880725
I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.	13.19950702989289
The business was therefore soon settled.	10.169452671392687
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.	11.658961000546894
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.	6.528079481778012
I thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.	13.27360813059179
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	9.380289123212044
His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.	14.82286601945967
He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.	11.826346265722032
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	6.619271664556188
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances - - and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	13.830343291219586
After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	9.366492856567142
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	8.258206426710801
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.	10.793425244326697
Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.	12.608368639214152
My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.	13.571626511661393
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	11.324898987751785
She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.	11.189499829739287
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	9.11853956344269
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.	13.080078434049542
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.	9.88863156543749
Younge was of course removed from her charge.	12.57194955268302
Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement.	9.917359458595866
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.	9.45543243789726
I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.	12.242032216247585
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	13.219805710231118
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.	10.85179842144624
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	11.80116474951344
If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.	10.53952335767993
I will only add, God bless you.	7.451484169112046
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.	13.299430004208643
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	9.567489263007523
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	12.547494171850685
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	12.111856270409323
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.	11.892460347315415
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.	11.030323325673553
His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.	14.94400777338543
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	10.077291425090307
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	9.810572928422827
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	9.382599411699948
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,"This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"- - and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.	11.440947698429406
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	11.684088008998723
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.	12.898685839654151
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.	11.893513050844039
But when she read, and re - read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	9.544192362017382
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - - deliberated on the probability of each statement - - but with little success.	10.921224796313151
On both sides it was only assertion.	12.761357532732665
Again she read on.	12.250383178317456
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	10.083774717916564
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.	9.5360213530658
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the - - - - shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	12.508530833055543
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.	14.906288028842079
His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	17.090248689843452
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	7.400019508851527
But no such recollection befriended her.	8.188525835054284
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.	10.713860966409674
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself - - from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.	11.615654298621935
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.	12.741739281410833
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	13.433008917944912
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.	10.943956452752724
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.	10.764529019787565
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy - - that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.	9.54488884469285
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	8.956340386222982
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust - - any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	9.041365544261081
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - - that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	10.857865784503117
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	10.628740500073064
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. - - Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.	8.623865213473374
But vanity, not love, has been my folly. - - Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.	13.232688111454747
Till this moment, I never knew myself."From herself to Jane - - from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	13.296816781899087
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. - - How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? - - He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; - - and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been. - - Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. - - She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.	11.6425358724782
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.	11.782952133647486
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	16.81099508421878
It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family; - - and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.	11.602527292783197
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re - considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	9.391555559419585
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. - - Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	10.737751268029013
She could think only of her letter.	14.920276247986514
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	9.010224419811172
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.	11.495759714841624
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. - -"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,"said Lady Catherine;"I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	11.777241778108078
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.	8.439064297273696
Collins so before you came.	12.499231570148664
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.	11.107965172083025
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.""But my father cannot. - - He wrote last week to hurry my return.""Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. - - Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.	10.476413934416641
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you - - and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.""You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	11.097010650265036
"Mrs.	9.924096673178443
Collins, you must send a servant with them.	12.014080457503544
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	9.802533899766512
You must contrive to send somebody.	9.238783864648491
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.	8.835099628802427
Collins.	22.328818669580418
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.""My uncle is to send a servant for us.""Oh! - - Your uncle! - - He keeps a man - servant, does he? - - I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.	9.737484696953976
Where shall you change horses? - - Oh! Bromley, of course. - - If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	11.559987079693505
Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	9.969040001877715
She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.	8.559622998086816
When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	9.699668929034694
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	8.988192720097764
They were hopeless of remedy.	7.191324822282641
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	11.5560264712864
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?	10.372502179967421
Catherine, weak - spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self - willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.	8.967784251815887
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.	11.634005381916475
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.	12.388621132922724
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.	11.085599073406318
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.	11.452315445762727
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.	11.873383865742138
The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	10.796670218121681
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.	9.648088574554444
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.	10.983822908700194
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.	13.52747843098221
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	11.566508364972812
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	10.45489714517373
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.	11.341513146905832
Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.	11.060136495073456
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	6.425735005101189
You see on what a footing we are.	10.68510369465136
You see how continually we are engaged there.	10.145186619855139
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.	11.207712401013453
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	10.337182630436706
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.	8.78557395053397
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate - - but on this point it will be as well to be silent.	11.344775214175854
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.	10.703213131126132
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.	10.854321776101541
Poor Charlotte! - - it was melancholy to leave her to such society! - - But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.	13.11468338643371
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.	11.060414332525639
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs.	12.586011637209467
Gardiner, though unknown.	15.03997272041652
He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.	11.866465989063544
"Good gracious!"cried Maria, after a few minutes silence,"it seems but a day or two since we first came! - - and yet how many things have happened!""A great many indeed,"said her companion with a sigh.	10.28037860644422
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! - - How much I shall have to tell!"Elizabeth privately added,"And how much I shall have to conceal."Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.	10.901165698918696
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.	10.38978849826274
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	15.233556243420484
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals.	9.94739369062669
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.	11.554701835332057
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch - street, for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs.	10.75887805803659
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	12.832900203785174
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern,"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.	10.796311706081378
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the - - - - shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.""Are they indeed?"cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	10.606612080951585
Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!""Yes,"thought Elizabeth,"_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.	11.018547862216636
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.""Now I have got some news for you,"said Lydia, as they sat down to table.	10.131312681328092
"What do you think?	12.655506009368274
It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.	11.561216668180853
Lydia laughed, and said,"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	13.305349797695742
You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.	10.061605465671857
I never saw such a long chin in my life.	10.26134643424944
Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	14.540192105379202
There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	13.290199078252005
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.	8.670496031822166
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	9.657291127479116
"How nicely we are crammed in!"cried Lydia.	8.471034172694477
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.	8.960682789954213
Have you seen any pleasant men?	9.16562720772672
Have you had any flirting?	16.47664816737554
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.	12.066240831168615
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	14.451605573272179
Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.	12.887236050778586
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady, - - only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col.	10.24327203832948
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.	14.881663904861577
Forster.	26.030276235023866
I thought I should have died.	12.28895626772472
And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.	9.461263400917877
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."Their party in the dining - room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.	9.431091044517155
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	11.03506676504067
"Oh! Mary,"said she,"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.	11.68600871710653
And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach.	12.222238160913916
I was ready to die of laughter.	8.665911920378411
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"To this, Mary very gravely replied,"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.	9.96550405356193
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.	6.535078038884225
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.	11.134798831662971
I should infinitely prefer a book."But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.	10.795131523920432
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.	10.33431658984211
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.	9.722513636050794
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	16.9761297822353
There was another reason too for her opposition.	10.29960625639283
She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	11.29052298464588
The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	13.072243299678835
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.	11.336405683807659
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	9.659809634495652
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.	11.344052788339225
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	8.212314463192087
She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	10.074400966356443
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,"said she;"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.""Indeed,"replied Elizabeth,"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	11.178980337931103
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?""Blame you! Oh, no.""But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham.""No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.""But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day."She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.	11.555208551974705
"This will not do,"said Elizabeth.	13.808596596141872
"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.	12.739099067125103
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.	14.151931074153378
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.	9.588514712041738
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	12.482787636963018
"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief.	10.024381988725608
And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.	12.336728993970706
Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing.	12.438960328079782
I am sure you must feel it so.""Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.	11.046376380185817
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.""Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.""There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.	10.211348898671908
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.""I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do.""And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.	11.977695961224152
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	11.01029642533989
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.""Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.""Indeed I could not.	10.698628296847351
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.	13.19929825508647
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.	11.320446570833429
There is one point, on which I want your advice.	14.054014083446344
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character."Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied,"Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	11.92112767004909
Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.	9.40898417088167
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?	12.745668689102
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.	11.940118723076337
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.	12.003372130648305
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	8.930142153310399
At present I will say nothing about it.""You are quite right.	10.149274300151298
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.	6.576561751980938
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re - establish a character.	10.122231381438668
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.	12.409157867518596
But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	8.144373062148407
She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.	10.344061829956944
"And then,"said she,"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	9.872575552768097
Jane was not happy.	18.813931358286133
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.	10.334805462833321
For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.	12.651409472662985
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	10.240174936119464
Well, he is a very undeserving young man - - and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	13.92841908361911
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know.""I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.""Oh, well! it is just as he chooses.	13.43595064993513
Nobody wants him to come.	16.160249282137418
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.	13.341527194414482
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.	12.710665223067096
Well, well, I only hope it will last.	13.993203596346614
And what sort of table do they keep?	8.25496070662975
Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.	11.474647124590078
If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.	12.284110279393362
There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.""No, nothing at all.""A great deal of good management, depend upon it.	8.507870124861237
Yes, yes.	17.715370247662875
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.	9.178193298226232
_They_ will never be distressed for money.	10.04850299325611
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	10.384669878341803
They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.""It was a subject which they could not mention before me.""No. It would have been strange if they had.	11.130466055499225
But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.	11.095315192508952
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	13.570241352980752
_I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."The first week of their return was soon gone.	12.512535553314226
The second began.	10.823493907879776
The dejection was almost universal.	9.115826830592162
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	10.168356487012783
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family.	8.315634153831326
"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!"would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	9.656427536479937
"I am sure,"said she,"I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.	7.593937816596188
I thought I should have broke my heart.""I am sure I shall break _mine_,"said Lydia.	9.646928340698514
Bennet.	12.110967658241837
"Oh, yes! - - if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.""A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever.""And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"added Kitty.	8.01162667869277
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn - house.	6.357446782611145
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.	11.778255281083895
She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.	10.346119029035146
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.	8.32446969771818
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	19.58303703385163
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months'acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	9.356489266776004
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.	14.247323572251995
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	7.973893580933506
"I cannot see why Mrs.	8.589305722664482
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"said she,"though I am _not_ her particular friend.	11.443739095251795
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.	14.91310891802945
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.	11.56267114743744
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.	10.756371733087576
He heard her attentively, and then said,"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.""If you were aware,"said Elizabeth,"of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.""Already arisen!"repeated Mr. Bennet.	11.014003739754234
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?	11.743231807214693
Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down.	12.447186784021365
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.	8.990756651072953
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	10.759216045362166
Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.	9.957790602753096
Excuse me - - for I must speak plainly.	15.3530366049466
A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	7.5492951146461085
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.	7.666132187252083
Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	11.578044285513164
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - - or I may say, three very silly sisters.	10.094573510712685
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.	10.714087646624876
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.	11.125112887910838
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.	10.844122279582223
The officers will find women better worth their notice.	6.90777393836824
Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.	11.847913486986053
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	10.279152275022652
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.	9.977580473528349
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.	9.632773125174475
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.	8.822196686913909
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	7.986906056435129
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.	12.517156197844402
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.	7.048897975556252
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	9.836823185588841
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.	17.124747321453082
Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	6.77851541727948
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	8.536158291880158
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	10.38624993026783
Her answer was warmly in his favour.	9.516295939513567
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added,"How long did you say that he was at Rosings?""Nearly three weeks.""And you saw him frequently?""Yes, almost every day.""His manners are very different from his cousin's.""Yes, very different.	10.838293119940612
But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.""Indeed!"cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.	11.371784749862094
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?	8.622589102105044
for I dare not hope,"he continued in a lower and more serious tone,"that he is improved in essentials.""Oh, no!"said Elizabeth.	12.133544823502227
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.	10.52059407513893
His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.	13.821400941794495
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.	11.556418382301741
His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.	13.344862385826056
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.	10.83401904788688
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.	9.377796352833009
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	11.404256947897078
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	9.074479487891182
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	11.454593416527766
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.	9.832549592033944
He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.	9.482190646040292
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	9.488164765846598
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.	14.976573973545477
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.	11.396053504270336
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	7.914272688333524
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	12.23517549023014
Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.	8.955942787996685
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.	12.684587133955803
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.	9.325721707883142
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	12.239561081731404
"But it is fortunate,"thought she,"that I have something to wish for.	16.057298574189858
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.	11.495387367458086
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.	11.007712597056301
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at Longbourn.	9.85143407473207
Everything wore a happier aspect.	7.468230713233952
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	10.492156999366511
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.	9.274260687702913
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.	9.944680241619356
In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.	12.903153367955724
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	10.836683727032295
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.	10.251893181283927
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	11.076575616599039
But it was her business to be satisfied - - and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.	14.221042093017926
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	9.888357133190647
"But surely,"said she,"I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."The period of expectation was now doubled.	8.817571597967955
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	10.936185840292431
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.	12.421357110371085
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way - - teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	10.641751426216116
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	9.547631249927267
One enjoyment was certain - - that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences - - cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure - - and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	7.2531768995933765
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, & c.	6.278427621369117
are sufficiently known.	9.135324439294049
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.	13.950821298306916
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	10.732096571984904
It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	11.82887658492128
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.	9.755710350147067
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.	10.37325913134407
Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	10.443568103930003
"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.	13.597624570873453
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."Elizabeth was distressed.	13.828653981542159
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	9.248074588668194
She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	8.221475437612051
Gardiner abused her stupidity.	8.111005493957956
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,"said she,"I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.	9.024903611027034
The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.	10.306588882374964
It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.	14.07595982871107
But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	13.046850337551417
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.	12.67771089717729
A most welcome negative followed the last question - - and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.	11.11744160150594
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	14.7657074013128
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	10.446848716015126
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	11.932075995892003
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.	9.049978874004356
They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.	8.859875744604134
Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	6.478671990567929
Elizabeth was delighted.	14.974368573837037
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.	10.154712871611538
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.	9.160508712650945
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.	14.573592013592691
The housekeeper came; a respectable - looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	10.025824673909867
It was a large, well - proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.	9.357435084801011
The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.	8.301536923217952
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	15.13850343409977
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.	7.252969100900102
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.	10.57208045130762
"And of this place,"thought she,"I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. - - But no,"- - recollecting herself, - -"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."This was a lucky recollection - - it saved her from something like regret.	11.450966856219303
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.	10.493713199923876
At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.	12.887635744116876
Reynolds replied, that he was, adding,"but we expect him to - morrow, with a large party of friends."How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	11.831461027782916
She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle - piece.	7.491184612303185
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	11.072384861322234
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence. - -"He is now gone into the army,"she added,"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."Mrs.	11.852940153976375
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.	14.205474440402405
"And that,"said Mrs.	10.67205132305682
It was drawn at the same time as the other - - about eight years ago.""I have heard much of your master's fine person,"said Mrs.	11.724566896372828
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."Mrs.	11.157642167804516
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"Elizabeth coloured, and said - -"A little.""And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?""Yes, very handsome.""I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	10.731957204044107
This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.	11.780722087160548
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.	11.136340792519585
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?"said Mr. Gardiner.	13.210904781425311
"Oh! yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished! - - She plays and sings all day long.	8.085753859309603
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - - a present from my master; she comes here to - morrow with him."Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.	8.695636260866529
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.	10.667821465922872
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?""Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.""Except,"thought Elizabeth,"when she goes to Ramsgate.""If your master would marry, you might see more of him.""Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.	11.63653531240544
Gardiner smiled.	14.387623162105802
Elizabeth could not help saying,"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.""I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him,"replied the other.	13.93713593128787
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.	11.779830814504214
That he was not a good - tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.	14.024457642597275
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.	12.560711457280345
But I have always observed, that they who are good - natured when children, are good - natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest - tempered, most generous - hearted, boy in the world."Elizabeth almost stared at her. - -"Can this be Mr. Darcy!"thought she.	10.06552144802541
"His father was an excellent man,"said Mrs.	11.398780358961314
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him - - just as affable to the poor."Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	12.132143858881312
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.	8.905092135669845
She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.	16.2805966302904
"He is the best landlord, and the best master,"said she,"that ever lived.	13.612750364996465
Not like the wild young men now - a - days, who think of nothing but themselves.	10.678379370537336
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.	12.234339233309509
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.	9.35134916262308
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.""In what an amiable light does this place him!"thought Elizabeth.	10.065928535867982
"This fine account of him,"whispered her aunt, as they walked,"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.""Perhaps we might be deceived.""That is not very likely; our authority was too good."On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.	10.933547593204452
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.	11.825761151482718
"And this is always the way with him,"she added. - -"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	12.455941258231396
There is nothing he would not do for her."The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed - rooms, were all that remained to be shewn.	13.693463578117061
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.	10.222462202494466
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.	11.494606710382039
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.	12.274239373527864
At last it arrested her - - and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.	10.53354944484831
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.	11.50763998300897
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.	13.977569950838449
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.	13.175099395542956
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.	10.562129109775531
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?	9.889852766606829
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship! - - How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! - - How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.	12.213027262550272
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	13.515226488863725
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	11.302069861311564
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	8.729467243117977
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.	9.601676133459515
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.	11.697871030651367
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.	10.166235717638045
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	11.279348630744376
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.	13.623539283087403
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.	12.874380018110974
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.	11.153907651054526
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.	12.075814263918213
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.	6.1635279240005865
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	14.796651715182056
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	11.449223169451717
That he should even speak to her was amazing! - - but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	11.242592251677328
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.	9.930519781275514
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.	11.556454050980726
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was.	10.105025287818462
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.	12.832621886717797
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease.	13.511965870132173
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.	14.37691631773233
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	10.540307318775367
Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.	11.509783574438794
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.	11.705810615730728
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it.	8.155443600366086
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.	9.12369157704098
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.	11.475097119731863
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	12.228367938626615
For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	10.884420320638855
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.	9.334230750288057
Her colour changed, and she said no more.	14.341461656799865
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	14.682792546518913
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.	10.55864069668771
"What will be his surprise,"thought she,"when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion."The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.	11.37169414805592
That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.	10.909140808548358
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.	11.608621265478435
It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	9.05661379684334
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.	12.280145683224857
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.	11.045838452784373
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.	12.471341687064681
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.	11.107084034102689
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.	11.974763174433825
It is impossible that he should still love me."After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	11.10866060629557
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.	10.695442644813252
Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.	11.396798890813281
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.	11.779361409172086
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected - -"for your housekeeper,"she added,"informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country."He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	12.8411890547166
"They will join me early to - morrow,"he continued,"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you, - - Mr. Bingley and his sisters."Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	9.862145916234262
"There is also one other person in the party,"he continued after a pause,"who more particularly wishes to be known to you, - - Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	12.699830527237376
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	9.356637982293837
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.	17.52546942530026
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.	9.848843725422697
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.	12.601616998736276
He then asked her to walk into the house - - but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	13.298077113381865
At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.	17.046170505355136
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.	10.057789487718722
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.	9.026530668215115
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly - - and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over.	8.672750834388767
On Mr. and Mrs.	9.510907396465058
Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.	11.377256933541895
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	13.216361131076411
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure,"replied her aunt,"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	13.235118586805946
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.	13.15937236726971
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.""To be sure, Lizzy,"said her aunt,"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.	13.884030262252926
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.	11.320790720366086
Gardiner,"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.	13.204402674967191
He has not an ill - natured look.	10.451955867136467
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.	8.345123225838558
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	13.463168567125878
But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	10.986535013174084
But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.	12.87584128657677
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	12.783814753966677
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	13.394937509940315
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.	8.954810109773186
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.	12.018961590678568
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.	10.29668906399131
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.	15.68111456022892
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	11.327454526891913
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	10.417662525611206
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.	13.850520635981882
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	11.685542459237798
Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.	13.572272548817915
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.	8.444025423056413
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.	11.098664025211162
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.	11.573319994001093
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.	8.648156783489132
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	13.07295392853808
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.	11.382007845927292
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done.	13.20020662065932
To Mr. and Mrs.	8.78797370093995
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.	9.920230246113565
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	10.012293943015285
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.	9.757830124495895
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.	9.4686374586803
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	19.43956894256894
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	12.091834611225948
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner.	11.853531682044316
But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.	12.598622934520536
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	10.32009399796039
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it"was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;"and, before she could reply, he added,"It is above eight months.	14.597147408597657
We have not met since the <NUM> th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.	9.951945427562555
There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.	16.415794746625053
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	10.909837707603396
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.	11.01811440059151
Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self - consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.	10.53259957012495
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.	14.704149725379585
Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.	9.351772216100954
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.	9.353521899193643
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	12.483010918317774
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.	13.381836819857117
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	11.381876201817827
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	13.81209148443588
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	12.0937719578998
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	12.434676363049798
They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy.	12.55252362819617
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	12.594156018202437
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town, where the family did not visit.	11.484718106034006
It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	11.776211819558865
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.	11.453743970844432
She certainly did not hate him.	12.01912618428693
It was gratitude. - - Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	9.368667338444064
He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	9.806537002259324
She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	12.635176083618335
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.	12.338714156003709
They were, therefore, to go. - - Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	14.307781455067614
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	10.55619888074697
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.	10.469190277126883
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	7.373683792231617
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	7.44449630292421
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs.	10.579191898174987
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.	11.065201733996265
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	11.96265156006601
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	14.35087136922067
By Mrs.	11.846374543189599
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.	9.552692443062613
It was first broken by Mrs.	6.845040258185004
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	12.122088058876408
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	12.347618977751388
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.	10.80463453785169
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.	11.978687533289298
Her own thoughts were employing her.	7.800244897856079
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	9.575439115124324
She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	13.655006236432424
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.	7.149964410716341
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.	17.119541023081503
There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.	10.016090774074945
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.	12.336200912992723
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.	12.782994541240353
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; - - a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.	10.968577230407503
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.	9.285168920659249
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	13.149145117888356
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the - - - - shire militia removed from Meryton?	12.664102748775834
While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	8.728820161840263
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.	10.858302855924919
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.	12.072359300920983
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.	9.096039231621745
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	12.235892625433245
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	10.21338423327775
But Georgiana would not join her.	11.597568105769527
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.	10.13506180780414
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.	12.509591233490132
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"she cried;"I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	11.345405393494813
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, - - no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.	9.183150802011696
"For my own part,"she rejoined,"I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.	13.427113360523244
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	10.442739334137658
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	8.055558452726215
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self - sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.	11.341041043262324
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield,'_She_ a beauty! - - I should as soon call her mother a wit.'But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.""Yes,"replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,"but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	11.134116620747115
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.	11.221999549659476
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	9.419296363383232
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.	13.148846110181635
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.	12.283450801233625
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.	12.347218713780068
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	12.509222124115476
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.	10.266773330606659
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.	9.223707644833256
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.	9.578954886774223
It was to this effect:"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you - - be assured that we are all well.	7.995535307202424
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! - - Imagine our surprise.	11.45220255670717
To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.	13.39548558088408
I am very, very sorry.	11.320204151039412
So imprudent a match on both sides! - - But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.	11.696444460749518
His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.	12.72271988253201
My father bears it better.	8.080880647961022
How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.	11.92565644272367
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.	8.32430666373775
The express was sent off directly.	7.927663168044536
My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.	11.449230279798392
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.	8.11903210793554
Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.	11.850745949808296
I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.	13.578011886405625
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	10.909054212493247
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	15.360966218005725
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.	12.004377350412334
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.	11.162468714409938
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs.	10.306805210818759
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F.	13.306831264121078
who instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.	7.2364674565005025
intending to trace their route.	9.164908620476641
All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.	10.43232305788485
I know not what to think.	11.010988027610143
After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.	9.06851311059872
came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through.	9.583767890440697
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.	10.357714961756024
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs.	9.631853015735773
F.	22.69877795272832
but no one can throw any blame on them.	7.269766266433775
Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.	14.969647759795969
My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.	9.432781109988898
I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F.	11.845842723763951
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.	10.286905588796676
was not a man to be trusted.	18.350222854691673
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room.	7.289432863355442
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder.	9.24708697605437
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	10.824799928765364
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	13.797856880964709
I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible.	11.144501900885064
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.	14.368222922678733
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.	10.919848322660945
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""Oh! where, where is my uncle?"cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.	12.35189289733524
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed,"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	9.141040146413888
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.""Good God! what is the matter?"cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself,"I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs.	10.809819669887668
Gardiner.	15.594652190028244
You are not well enough; - - you cannot go yourself."Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	10.605751137677114
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.	8.971697199259394
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,"Let me call your maid.	10.278806174901058
Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief? - - A glass of wine; - - shall I get you one? - - You are very ill.""No, I thank you;"she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	10.214600235036395
"There is nothing the matter with me.	9.864034468897664
I am quite well.	10.609318870155844
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.	10.845017361906871
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.	13.148910958378785
At length, she spoke again.	12.89576333066093
"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.	12.875106279857107
It cannot be concealed from any one.	11.481980341853015
My youngest sister has left all her friends - - has eloped; - - has thrown herself into the power of - - of Mr. Wickham.	10.68356522593583
They are gone off together from Brighton.	7.917480519282356
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	12.12460058005758
She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to - - she is lost for ever."Darcy was fixed in astonishment.	12.330311473553111
"When I consider,"she added, in a yet more agitated voice,"that _I_ might have prevented it! - - _I_ who knew what he was.	12.66206397386123
But it is all, all too late now.""I am grieved, indeed,"cried Darcy;"grieved - - shocked.	13.298062335425886
But is it certain, absolutely certain?""Oh yes! - - They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.""And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?""My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.	10.603600061353026
How is such a man to be worked on?	15.428428772252063
I have not the smallest hope.	9.784211703782118
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character. - - Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not - - I was afraid of doing too much.	12.961545538333786
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.	9.325084796218508
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	13.531062130635505
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	8.138414766647118
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	8.397405341667731
It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.	11.853912136113236
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	11.677919148846449
Lydia - - the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	11.397786928997085
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress. - - But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	9.064181418804793
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day.""Oh, yes.	10.428791962794442
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.	9.83367121223699
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.	5.674092909544558
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible. - - I know it cannot be long."He readily assured her of his secrecy - - again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.	11.772150639180653
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	8.422613499070614
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	8.408996668051536
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.	9.247290336003216
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.	11.797164375551846
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.	14.90908589484409
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.	15.863272341139158
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise - - all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.	11.24761879677933
But now it was all too natural.	12.860115948342738
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.	11.40341630458591
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl. - - Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.	8.421016194389734
Mr. and Mrs.	6.0627138299018775
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; - - but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy. - - Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs.	10.53620532790378
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.	10.659837050903702
They were to be off as soon as possible.	12.997052642116369
Gardiner.	15.594652190028244
"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; - - was it so?""Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	10.644231367448672
_That_ is all settled.""That is all settled;"repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.	13.979207521030872
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.	10.373504161075624
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.	11.361423284096405
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.	12.96907187342059
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"said her uncle, as they drove from the town;"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.	12.661010238423632
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.	10.61736908019673
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?	13.86872796195422
His temptation is not adequate to the risk.""Do you really think so?"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	11.579614960653908
"Upon my word,"said Mrs.	8.43760999482878
Gardiner,"I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.	15.221612077111786
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?""Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	12.322424353335968
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.	11.542458236522469
If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it.	14.76512263832595
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?""In the first place,"replied Mr. Gardiner,"there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.""Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.""Well, then - - supposing them to be in London.	11.511627424899721
They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	14.473995823946858
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.""But why all this secrecy?	9.682005476629742
Why any fear of detection?	10.085909219732205
His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.	13.050358741429553
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	11.629589065789053
He cannot afford it.	8.88751989317347
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	9.401594213573924
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	10.56989716965244
But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.	12.479903557952149
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?""It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes,"that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.	13.013186353400146
But, really, I know not what to say.	13.758416858602201
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.	11.626367589183957
But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.	11.635030344562026
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	10.486147302867597
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater - - what shall I call it?	11.555758960186106
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	11.995384467296827
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.""But you see that Jane,"said her aunt,"does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.""Of whom does Jane ever think ill?	11.289161422277633
And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?	12.882118794698913
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.	12.362843188517877
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.	13.969370592638372
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	9.63315995417961
That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.""And do you really know all this?"cried Mrs.	10.91624856025769
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	13.141108967870567
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	12.491287247827218
From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.	10.809440249924839
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?""Oh, yes! - - that, that is the worst of all.	12.955485116522688
Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.	15.292322095503241
As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	12.091770401931013
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.	10.013280527736889
Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	11.297266158228066
That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	11.382745626979359
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	10.971137721546125
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.	11.808065836922466
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	13.923231187197752
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	8.690261097226484
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner - time the next day.	7.688250885073928
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	10.03821354611761
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	9.257796395567803
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.	10.452786187756201
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well.""Is my father in town?""Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word.""And have you heard from him often?""We have heard only once.	12.530932748140751
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.	11.585368021625538
He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention.""And my mother - - How is she?	12.995747545118762
How are you all?""My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.	11.939147596893438
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.	13.304963937176659
She does not yet leave her dressing - room.	10.372013811540095
Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well.""But you - - How are you?"cried Elizabeth.	10.778576925844986
"You look pale.	10.238651741184976
How much you must have gone through!"Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.	14.751819161343313
Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.	12.264960785355338
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	10.28409832036742
When they were all in the drawing - room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.	13.71914859966624
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	11.538743753858347
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	7.924694395619034
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?	9.422388761406461
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.	13.091771356059052
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over - ruled, as I always am.	13.217342557864738
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.	12.120244750094571
"Do not give way to useless alarm,"added he,"though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	14.755488291905955
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.	11.239883867394356
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.	11.831619909772256
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.""Oh! my dear brother,"replied Mrs.	13.046733361692459
Bennet,"that is exactly what I could most wish for.	13.127328822110831
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.	13.289332679946934
And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.	8.5371338929837
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, - - that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	11.340866271824389
Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	15.066614382444449
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.	11.108778592892454
In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.	9.474468856836438
One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.	15.26371973072088
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.	11.302945656884285
As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	12.0853341266952
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable - - that one false step involves her in endless ruin - - that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful, - - and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.	9.49166930878617
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	10.776397951806445
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.	11.001055879346014
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying,"But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard.	12.914234399446011
Give me farther particulars.	9.43130389317061
What did Colonel Forster say?	11.784633038005204
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?	10.994400324500921
They must have seen them together for ever.""Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	11.287050502819378
I am so grieved for him.	8.867483455933867
He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.""And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?	10.60384395401889
Did he know of their intending to go off?	14.505314999545048
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?""Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	9.375139018062782
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying - - and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.""And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?""How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy - - a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.	12.085970475573005
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.	10.06771097300211
Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	12.899768255230248
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.""But not before they went to Brighton?""No, I believe not.""And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?	12.941275315947287
Does he know his real character?""I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.	11.960024922627104
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	11.905945232105005
"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	9.83489848073584
We acted with the best intentions.""Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?""He brought it with him for us to see."Jane then took it from her pocket - book, and gave it to Elizabeth.	12.801429710692737
These were the contents:"MY DEAR HARRIET,"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.	10.971931774547315
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia Wickham.	12.405882143627924
What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing.	12.163399898177703
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	13.67194306836497
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up.	9.396263544861215
Good bye.	12.864669566228114
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	15.183958569770345
But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	13.711136805503518
My poor father! how he must have felt it!""I never saw any one so shocked.	11.578544393106405
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.	9.872395099173865
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!""Oh! Jane,"cried Elizabeth,"was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?""I do not know. - - I hope there was. - - But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	13.476645106655914
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties.""Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	11.187747217237696
Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.""Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	12.282167550026738
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us.""She had better have stayed at home,"cried Elizabeth;"perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.	11.476029902667504
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	11.547504368373925
"He meant, I believe,"replied Jane,"to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.	11.55952202974009
His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.	9.72896234544865
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	10.452449246130001
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	10.152579098058512
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	11.97312000825829
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	11.654564230604906
Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	10.637127884530424
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	13.427540114731066
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.	13.269166884232284
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.	7.627596044333709
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	15.287116009383103
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.	8.879743127298031
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	9.756422510853996
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.	12.374313719670589
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.	12.514513529712561
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.	11.786914725962284
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	10.83852458535714
He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.	12.644866377212121
There was also a postscript to this effect.	7.410682473388643
At present we have nothing to guide us.	10.315827499391514
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	12.222756559047298
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	12.30838965558338
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the - - - - shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.	12.921027068940806
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.	12.739841498346982
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	13.315295119144494
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	10.668634846205114
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	12.499897094036866
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.	12.610560195755715
Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	11.420421060686692
No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	10.008323427721061
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	10.72149081791178
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.	12.435132367899032
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.	11.341880869947511
Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs.	13.547599803930373
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.	13.904874482614733
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family.	10.8017622785447
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.	7.94516662217058
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.	10.379825416224653
"I am, dear Sir, & c.	8.066643886615939
& c."Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	14.520658421378194
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	11.823416941356928
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.	12.578224477649597
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.	12.673612158255679
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.	11.778561493677017
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	8.059661672970867
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	12.526602605457198
Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.	9.994420131513593
"This is wholly unexpected.	9.854228724086246
Rendered spiritless by the ill - success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother - in - law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.	12.082140451733245
When Mrs.	11.77495791501297
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.	13.222195156395907
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!"she cried.	12.577138306216847
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"As Mrs.	14.043015863276636
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.	13.377404199060836
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.	10.426166080054982
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	13.431081964800745
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs.	9.617880933444688
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	12.92456139147432
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better.	11.74212225022464
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.	12.397595396347645
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.	13.070580157160332
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.	12.173876714805495
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied,"Say nothing of that.	12.024094054918422
Who should suffer but myself?	9.931927722882916
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.""You must not be too severe upon yourself,"replied Elizabeth.	12.90473470264491
"You may well warn me against such an evil.	8.942201571355218
Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.	10.464539483136624
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	10.964779651267953
It will pass away soon enough.""Do you suppose them to be in London?""Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?""And Lydia used to want to go to London,"added Kitty.	10.685186706702
"She is happy, then,"said her father, drily;"and her residence there will probably be of some duration."Then, after a short silence, he continued,"Lizzy, I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.	11.203067805085487
"This is a parade,"cried he,"which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can, - - or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away.""I am not going to run away, Papa,"said Kitty, fretfully;"if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.""_You_ go to Brighton! - - I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.	10.834574215075614
No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.	9.37018475439509
Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	9.561524644078228
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	12.179716997537026
"Well, well,"said he,"do not make yourself unhappy.	11.823641355932429
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet,"I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.""What do you mean, Hill?	11.939127531150085
We have heard nothing from town.""Dear madam,"cried Mrs.	9.89707125311449
Hill, in great astonishment,"don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?	13.141278514898463
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	11.100376159674145
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library; - - their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	10.779453405522247
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,"Oh, Papa, what news?	11.27708000335927
what news?	15.71267959742889
have you heard from my uncle?""Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.""Well, and what news does it bring?	12.383794467399234
good or bad?""What is there of good to be expected?"said he, taking the letter from his pocket;"but perhaps you would like to read it."Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	12.247234411376718
Jane now came up.	11.685676111602287
"Read it aloud,"said their father,"for I hardly know myself what it is about.""Gracechurch - street, Monday, August <NUM>.	9.601953208014837
Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.	11.54521821395533
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	13.569683953914558
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both - - - -""Then it is, as I always hoped,"cried Jane;"they are married!"Elizabeth read on;"I have seen them both.	15.004509385614902
They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.	13.154867011076599
These are conditions, which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.	11.979127556228631
I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	8.72223646043734
You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.	11.69662240133996
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	12.875395124455718
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.	9.324879350278769
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.	11.80071335337238
Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.	10.37600862008271
We have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.	13.429142262260577
Your's, & c.	7.159408800348392
"EDW.	13.652647417843177
GARDINER.""Is it possible!"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	13.28038523882087
"Can it be possible that he will marry her?""Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;"said her sister.	15.782186056584255
"My dear father, I congratulate you.""And have you answered the letter?"said Elizabeth.	11.176614509382581
"No; but it must be done soon."Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.	13.463863719419699
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case.""Let me write for you,"said Jane,"if you dislike the trouble yourself.""I dislike it very much,"he replied;"but it must be done."And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	12.592039674588781
"And may I ask?"said Elizabeth,"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.""Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.""And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!""Yes, yes, they must marry.	11.265908699130188
There is nothing else to be done.	12.184688462787456
But there are two things that I want very much to know: - - one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him.""Money! my uncle!"cried Jane,"what do you mean, Sir?""I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.""That is very true,"said Elizabeth;"though it had not occurred to me before.	12.828872354345506
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.	11.320722864388166
Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast - room.	10.919209536815638
"And they are really to be married!"cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.	12.46592591640577
"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.	11.579011588709445
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!""I comfort myself with thinking,"replied Jane,"that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	12.297482456618834
He has children of his own, and may have more.	14.903617729834789
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?""If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"said Elizabeth,"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.	11.231422002057437
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	11.048446230023561
By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!""We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"said Jane:"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.	11.512860452410507
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.	13.937812277760985
It is useless to talk of it."It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	12.7146214419664
They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.	14.270978401290307
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.	9.20908815548832
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet could hardly contain herself.	10.424332535914031
As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.	10.727056380063564
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	8.360746108118766
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.	16.595269874031473
"My dear, dear Lydia!"she cried:"This is delightful indeed! - - She will be married! - - I shall see her again! - - She will be married at sixteen! - - My good, kind brother! - - I knew how it would be - - I knew he would manage every thing.	10.97703540656495
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.	15.796232875237397
Stay, stay, I will go myself.	13.41876992022171
My dear, dear Lydia! - - How merry we shall be together when we meet!"Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	10.047139238345492
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,"she added,"in a great measure, to his kindness.	12.219170221910934
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.""Well,"cried her mother,"it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?	11.49077749185365
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	15.414940263973607
Well! I am so happy.	14.632352414828299
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.	14.426113324806252
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Wickham! How well it sounds.	9.257929941402303
And she was only sixteen last June.	11.747950242672982
Other schemes too came into her head.	9.276292944877504
"I will go to Meryton,"said she,"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.	13.899590005212088
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.	13.64022212173661
Long.	17.824174952451187
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.	9.500128026619471
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.	9.963692003501777
Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?	18.934297216068593
Oh! here comes Hill.	9.638036055867119
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."Mrs.	11.422342617088267
Hill began instantly to express her joy.	9.415653299460871
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	10.568142681027256
Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.	11.156294198674747
He now wished it more than ever.	11.24696265035249
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	9.773096652639616
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	7.8130671496207205
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	12.539403433441997
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	12.514252604699704
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.	8.559649426040544
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.	11.378046655705823
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.	14.051561892524079
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.	13.11769900166048
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.	8.00257320084464
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.	6.646932628334588
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.	11.166051396914543
This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	13.763436190687079
He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.	13.21617907628672
He would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.	10.108242319257572
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.	12.801642755369773
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	8.802192980333592
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.	13.391325762312945
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.	9.152152346855582
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.	9.353879632086116
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.	11.193828578745334
It was a fortnight since Mrs.	9.398233618298903
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.	14.533936722278138
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	12.003969995662558
Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	12.003013174594535
I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs.	9.645447231776187
Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.	10.364363553537475
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.	9.58416946023622
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet could hardly comprehend it.	10.373906070923237
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.	8.96039192398924
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.	10.760112972820457
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.	11.971662785783536
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	9.432268607613166
Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.	9.68667214974653
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	10.90039532452755
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	14.605158012458817
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.	10.629412059992536
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.	11.294825576800969
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.	12.55851259663094
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.	14.091700011343903
But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.	13.917082072210512
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.	10.95525137796564
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	12.360133067379232
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.	12.759611450427535
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	15.093074133866564
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.	12.316866810331065
* * * * * Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	9.129445752678839
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.	11.00744817190276
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,"he added,"as soon as his marriage was fixed on.	12.918846043615584
And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.	10.527641595823257
It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	10.02428506367753
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General - - - -'s regiment, now quartered in the North.	9.407571585034283
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.	15.477826784005874
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.	9.330503007721319
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information.	8.259137051283396
He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.	13.002890113011867
Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.	14.020735382722552
They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.	9.305815984633922
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South.	11.52889700467353
She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother. - - Your's, & c.	12.201514014066952
"E.	13.652647417843177
GARDINER."Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the - - - - shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.	12.952604575087944
But Mrs.	9.83933839115461
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.	12.43218311681681
"She is so fond of Mrs.	11.249787132029159
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	12.003054864066671
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.	13.186502423149307
When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.	13.069181941815575
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.	13.680662771055816
The carriage was sent to meet them at - - - -, and they were to return in it, by dinner - time.	12.834342913469332
They came.	14.37879392344891
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.	15.52921991956595
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.	9.502245977121143
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.	11.224212618976585
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	9.486785451161172
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.	10.6742416285321
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.	7.45583821822507
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.	11.398390951040072
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.	14.543202859056123
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.	6.547623699475084
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.	11.549227011412851
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	12.733654556819904
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.	10.123697501253528
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	8.862572018896014
There was no want of discourse.	11.636085111002359
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.	12.125449605860943
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.	12.041783141643922
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.	12.011777474112442
"Only think of its being three months,"she cried,"since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.	12.801057425983357
Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."Her father lifted up his eyes.	12.363929313861703
Jane was distressed.	13.098750963975442
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,"Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to - day?	10.711830515048833
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing."Elizabeth could bear it no longer.	10.33696989043906
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour.	12.924464003870106
Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called"Mrs.	12.749265404520502
Hill and the two housemaids.	16.633699185159838
"Well, mamma,"said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room,"and what do you think of my husband?	14.037093243115
Is not he a charming man?	11.064754343280406
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.	6.724963694908529
They must all go to Brighton.	8.743274093087345
That is the place to get husbands.	16.066913346847816
But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.	13.433826991181487
Must it be so?""Oh, lord! yes; - - there is nothing in that.	12.459593288787518
I shall like it of all things.	14.704881218267037
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.""I should like it beyond any thing!"said her mother.	11.370041863045964
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.""I thank you for my share of the favour,"said Elizabeth;"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	11.42470214796261
Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	11.78473101351002
No one but Mrs.	10.353438459025233
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.	9.566842022519278
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.	13.823149402289571
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	12.212801117121993
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.	10.76312274729683
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.	14.10076783934885
You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.	15.66979428969965
We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.	12.334429467343517
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.	7.605465470223006
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.	12.125037681082585
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.	14.408949773542876
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.	11.422141427297099
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.	9.79220364736355
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	14.759675361794871
To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.	8.930449954605061
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.	12.486144107245375
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.	15.487648770033974
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	12.04272552171546
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.""Mr. Darcy!"repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	13.359516940217961
"Oh, yes! - - he was to come there with Wickham, you know.	12.760177277888141
But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.	11.677084539463538
I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?	7.815353552825555
You may depend upon my seeking no further.""Oh! certainly,"said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;"we will ask you no questions.""Thank you,"said Lydia,"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.	11.526135262308475
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.	10.448759526353113
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	11.233031675165984
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.	10.715316744448682
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	10.474586802371014
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.	9.255234376719795
"You may readily comprehend,"she added,"what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.	11.168043177416449
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it - - unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.""Not that I _shall_ though,"she added to herself, as she finished the letter;"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it; - - till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	11.751825174791055
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.	12.768420148184001
She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.	14.687182193898431
"Gracechurch - street, Sept.	7.852664357815929
"MY DEAR NIECE,"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.	9.065543140840484
I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.	10.357787558541732
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know, that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side.	10.409123198411097
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.	10.801118344051057
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am - - and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done.	14.633935275818525
But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.	11.673521649881554
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	12.914578494746236
It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been.	7.948575841309399
He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.	12.31241971984868
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.	13.169248661533418
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.	11.026048561015426
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	11.391989054386995
He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself.	12.616353539222581
There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs.	14.631896063930599
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.	11.103056421273045
She then took a large house in Edward - street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	7.776292128693973
This Mrs.	12.614015997483406
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	14.507675463771772
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.	13.20744633721549
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.	10.256743346475428
They were in - - - - street.	12.988361333803125
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.	10.646249463895636
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	13.621083417049922
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	8.115819847750972
She cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving Wickham.	12.424217485803307
She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.	12.542803903596102
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	11.652457227205646
He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	11.190902360694391
Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.	11.058245937526246
But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	11.220164102602046
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.	10.491224759940762
They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.	15.507548569561399
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	13.518132004461716
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch - street the evening before I came home.	9.724422592956598
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	12.626279195261338
He did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.	14.168048101025066
On Saturday he came again.	11.02784130813997
Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.	13.741089785275044
They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.	11.857662184913918
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	10.28878901505227
But our visitor was very obstinate.	10.18786765606986
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all.	13.525158257472608
He has been accused of many faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	8.860882676675919
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	11.920361169795852
They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.	11.049039596599144
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.	9.384201594092126
You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.	14.468554748400848
His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased.	10.49215314619895
It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.	13.55167732124861
Perhaps there was some truth in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve, can be answerable for the event.	10.052049641026763
But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair.	10.071091423544267
I believe I have now told you every thing.	12.712335416099494
Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.	15.02414029466781
_He_ was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no fresh pain.	12.336925349578474
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	15.620429882992756
If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.	13.641652571078078
I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	10.742431276389727
Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.	11.360958084106175
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.	10.008702916671789
But slyness seems the fashion.	6.8030932233205474
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.	12.122558798432557
A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	9.8998002690376
But I must write no more.	13.947456784043935
The children have been wanting me this half hour.	9.138160351662613
Your's, very sincerely,"M.	15.002679631630278
GARDINER."The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.	9.667492571912655
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	10.48402836415605
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	11.395907089995772
Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	11.470948207394192
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	10.355072357949899
Brother - in - law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.	9.03169090927609
She was ashamed to think how much.	11.632203778671883
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.	11.231419509883702
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him.	12.763999235254689
Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.	8.034467416045846
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	13.128299260115428
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.	12.825562371816979
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.	11.842248534816358
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	11.05476052860417
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.	12.103135028755934
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"said he, as he joined her.	8.495358883908311
"You certainly do,"she replied with a smile;"but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.""I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	12.683225448222705
_We_ were always good friends; and now we are better.""True.	12.53887927358944
Are the others coming out?""I do not know.	10.149629747502418
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.	13.957924284682294
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."She replied in the affirmative.	12.919723687701081
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?	13.493466181334282
But of course she did not mention my name to you.""Yes, she did.""And what did she say?""That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had - - not turned out well.	11.772850381822582
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.""Certainly,"he replied, biting his lips.	8.725661071191812
We passed each other several times.	10.700426040018744
I wonder what he can be doing there.""Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,"said Elizabeth.	11.264250149716082
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.""Undoubtedly.	12.862568700434002
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?	13.67619829171996
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.""Yes; he introduced us to his sister.""And do you like her?""Very much.""I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.	11.539480317763276
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	13.249726021810346
A most delightful place! - - Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.""How should you have liked making sermons?""Exceedingly well.	9.401215731650213
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?""I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.""You have.	10.950954630795572
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember.""I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.""You did! and it was not wholly without foundation.	12.696582022105458
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	11.824626271781527
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.	12.373704295341986
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.	10.574694675881942
"Oh! my dear Lydia,"she cried,"when shall we meet again?""Oh, lord! I don't know.	9.471380166349617
But you know married women have never much time for writing.	9.257780553928388
They will have nothing else to do."Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	10.460916473388963
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	11.37697556124256
"He is as fine a fellow,"said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house,"as ever I saw.	11.975102512472276
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.	15.123622372309317
I am prodigiously proud of him.	8.351531097541429
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son - in - law."The loss of her daughter made Mrs.	10.251115185742057
Bennet very dull for several days.	7.903428684597872
One seems so forlorn without them.""This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,"said Elizabeth.	9.86296849535344
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.""It is no such thing.	10.066176425769159
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	13.177120888625906
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	12.998549794089827
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.	11.910160704831632
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.	17.24842895715183
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	12.448891198863288
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"(for Mrs.	13.698166905767243
Not that I care about it, though.	16.935824249286267
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.	12.22854330323753
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	13.428307068415554
And who knows what _may_ happen?	7.654912075156975
But that is nothing to us.	14.202622171302762
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?""You may depend on it,"replied the other,"for Mrs.	13.741666390446298
Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	13.166395432344588
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	9.111245277542073
She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed."Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour.	11.83488508691204
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,"I saw you look at me to - day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.	13.595619881900692
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.	9.298750596445185
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.	13.854478097172754
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.	9.9750025018733
I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	11.385847738349499
Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	11.594300094115841
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.	12.193032361646017
"Yet it is hard,"she sometimes thought,"that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	13.671404802776891
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"said Mrs.	10.251945098737346
Bennet,"you will wait on him of course.""No, no.	13.144518341553297
But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.	11.339580936350808
"'Tis an etiquette I despise,"said he.	6.854335087732003
"If he wants our society, let him seek it.	9.037813754988516
I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again.""Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.	9.809188656940588
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.	10.638412906673805
We must have Mrs.	12.62129175113848
Long and the Gouldings soon.	13.687049309952075
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did.	11.095927694292646
As the day of his arrival drew near,"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,"said Jane to her sister.	15.838610942578594
My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says.	12.416778314277584
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!""I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,"replied Elizabeth;"but it is wholly out of my power.	13.21612897624143
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."Mr. Bingley arrived.	12.26077242782793
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	10.431121067292372
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing - room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	11.294529766204581
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	7.718638367970148
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window - - she looked, - - she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.	14.290659552223099
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,"said Kitty;"who can it be?""Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.""La!"replied Kitty,"it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.	12.453554470219002
Mr. what's his name.	11.684847433939776
Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	11.513020337302168
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.	11.046409035948964
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.	10.119972360326992
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.	9.82066677630171
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	10.47937570897448
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.	13.692814462330094
Her astonishment at his coming - - at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.	12.60705023115053
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.	9.5595249845801
But she would not be secure.	15.753978136657453
"Let me first see how he behaves,"said she;"it will then be early enough for expectation."She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	10.063556074925064
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.	10.416386098048871
On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	9.068314293551744
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	12.279085266494064
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	8.841915869887435
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	11.829284653099608
He was received by Mrs.	8.92166211128049
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.	9.9685111387512
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs.	13.36875061355426
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	12.762906411271572
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.	15.296705888102942
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	11.097915245030356
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"said she.	12.687652956144435
"Yet why did he come?"She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.	12.661258433835485
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"said Mrs.	9.819754952383859
Bennet.	12.110967658241837
He readily agreed to it.	9.962909809161808
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	14.572117467773582
People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.	12.092989280333809
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.	8.40778115842802
Miss Lucas is married and settled.	9.457557079128922
And one of my own daughters.	18.204352957199138
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.	14.823572332618399
Did you see it?"Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	14.525482278031733
How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.	13.826931937630492
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"continued her mother,"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.	13.583822894509241
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.	11.83418602134846
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	13.983499780223985
Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	12.924225633664767
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.	13.054800824545792
A few weeks, he believed.	15.516555735279411
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,"said her mother,"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr. Bennet's manor.	11.489517680126117
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.	11.079723776971147
"The first wish of my heart,"said she to herself,"is never more to be in company with either of them.	14.71511073212056
Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her former lover.	9.856141800573285
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	11.9711375563914
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.	14.286610862869123
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.	13.475995284915752
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.	9.693648534428826
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.	12.5642024391978
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year.	11.350449314164473
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.	8.64093438219286
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"said she,"did he come at all?"She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	13.291836717620903
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?	17.17428812108688
If he fears me, why come hither?	10.484592576135025
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?	11.159860564109207
Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him."Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.	12.261184001571172
"Now,"said she,"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.	10.244341308152665
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.	6.670287207293667
It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.""Yes, very indifferent indeed,"said Elizabeth, laughingly.	9.057181830345316
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.	14.521428546215523
When they repaired to the dining - room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.	12.768655221329936
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.	13.638186927712072
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	8.949243397293543
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half - laughing alarm.	10.447787937284488
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	9.935941463359425
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.	12.878176136414833
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	11.669160909250179
He was on one side of her mother.	13.519106886564565
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.	11.078911890873957
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did.	11.275116303912778
Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.	11.693289356107472
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	10.740180858310449
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing - room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.	12.400836610245218
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	14.229807552290627
"If he does not come to me, _then_,"said she,"I shall give him up for ever."The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.	11.603180241782058
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.	12.93242374597118
We want none of them; do we?"Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	12.015469661404476
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	12.182430209877369
Annesley is with her.	11.3844415311032
When the tea - things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.	10.369415406971024
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	12.46141043362888
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	9.538186119276403
"Well girls,"said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,"What say you to the day?	14.725645751381498
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.	11.356587885191727
The venison was roasted to a turn - - and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.	9.300513888128762
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.	10.194199479374753
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.	11.393871010490333
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.	11.880056200638933
And what do you think she said besides?	13.884807756702957
'Ah! Mrs.	7.633733334069849
I do think Mrs.	9.507964888088338
Long is as good a creature as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."Mrs.	10.545588599923681
"It has been a very agreeable day,"said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.	15.409734476138361
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	11.53153505776988
I hope we may often meet again."Elizabeth smiled.	12.618810857364116
"Lizzy, you must not do so.	15.484041432018516
You must not suspect me.	10.129211282455083
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	8.892412094447115
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man.""You are very cruel,"said her sister,"you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.""How hard it is in some cases to be believed!""And how impossible in others!""But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?""That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	11.562431440429892
We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	9.548207296098695
His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.	11.899407074927847
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.	11.48049595361826
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	12.46926585555207
"Next time you call,"said she,"I hope we shall be more lucky."He should be particularly happy at any time, & c.	9.891247298242074
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.	16.370715465866553
In ran Mrs.	9.171406545022647
Make haste, make haste.	9.323912684459746
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair.""We will be down as soon as we can,"said Jane;"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.""Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it?	11.036289435553226
After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.	13.040262666633554
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.	8.81375271456168
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.	9.12063939076262
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said,"What is the matter mamma?	13.819936284725042
What do you keep winking at me for?	10.908190720627962
What am I to do?""Nothing child, nothing.	12.950679784818515
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	11.902936225644726
In a few minutes, Mrs.	7.498614411181517
Bennet half opened the door and called out,"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."Elizabeth was forced to go.	12.491679723076636
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.	13.534384739491019
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room."Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing - room.	11.265027321017334
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	8.373955424277568
Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	11.043755014967811
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	10.848695059550755
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	13.426779157763102
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.	9.202165120025573
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.	14.523455914471114
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.	9.913677486714011
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.	14.579501660358273
Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.	11.320678451399303
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	11.249225690131821
But on returning to the drawing - room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.	12.618150348097439
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.	10.721818217958946
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse.	8.129345272481917
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.	11.306631753642929
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	12.32362382983826
I do not deserve it.	9.573246894127298
Oh! why is not every body as happy?"Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.	11.438492320409066
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.	11.03646771024076
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.	11.404628678958348
He is gone to my father already.	14.519006078373636
Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	12.107667526581203
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.	8.986617403036904
"And this,"said she,"is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.	11.719496229377716
"Where is your sister?"said he hastily, as he opened the door.	12.214455059939088
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.	11.375848422006996
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super - excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.	11.424668617728296
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.	9.84244802788798
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,"Jane, I congratulate you.	12.880262546900452
You will be a very happy woman."Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.	14.86641418337032
"You are a good girl;"he replied,"and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.	12.297408195734558
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.	12.694165091810282
Your tempers are by no means unlike.	7.872541723859629
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_.""Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,"cried his wife,"what are you talking of?	8.992802499862457
Why, he has four or five thousand a - year, and very likely more."Then addressing her daughter,"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	8.959567068977615
I knew how it would be.	11.55314546551674
I always said it must be so, at last.	14.37914142514197
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.	12.836265491655658
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.	15.013127617908344
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.	9.406055848720797
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.	11.523505469420382
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	12.091022860683617
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.	9.87430316016345
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	12.343850860996154
In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.	13.619850532703552
"He has made me so happy,"said she, one evening,"by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.""I suspected as much,"replied Elizabeth.	12.859200290962969
"But how did he account for it?""It must have been his sister's doing.	12.200456439233841
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	11.215688169122444
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.""That is the most unforgiving speech,"said Elizabeth,"that I ever heard you utter.	13.088566621674643
Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.""Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!""He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.	12.24830219793895
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.	12.333768176749386
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"cried Jane.	8.322915192365187
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!""If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.	11.061078076499879
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.	14.479362672282718
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.	11.868516719412828
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.	8.612421786343045
Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.	13.525245068723015
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	11.147298289631228
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.	11.472477809592652
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	15.726054246965946
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.	12.277191618803279
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.	11.611237616212367
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.	8.032400877607477
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	14.609448068910625
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.	11.516745682638371
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.	13.027945482759804
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	12.264339757937401
That lady I suppose is your mother."Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	11.240902117162133
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.""Yes, madam,"said Mrs.	9.680982020833666
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.	14.651452411020077
"She is my youngest girl but one.	10.955958350981271
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.""This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."Mrs.	10.707570501091226
Collins well.""Yes, very well.	12.097232823740367
I saw them the night before last."Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	14.103381456742955
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	10.44831180391984
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.	11.47263460719102
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.	8.728425147259781
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?"said she, as she looked in her face.	12.757347110444895
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner: - -"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.	10.943198165727342
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	9.889944883595302
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.	13.20873112257523
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.""Miss Bennet,"replied her ladyship, in an angry tone,"you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.	13.670368115749264
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	9.457339206161379
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.	13.685880632804466
Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.""If you believed it impossible to be true,"said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain,"I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.	10.97537826573026
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?	8.098708267546918
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?""I never heard that it was.""And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?""I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	9.481105087803433
_You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer.""This is not to be borne.	11.963815834057934
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	13.479872397582154
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	9.889562468888835
You may have drawn him in.""If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.""Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	14.924417092432488
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.	8.810213180304327
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.""But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.""Let me be rightly understood.	9.382843909863173
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.	11.793212702020208
No, never.	17.86645737485836
Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.	6.675558686081734
From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.	11.129506786978606
It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.	12.49093983430012
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?	8.05782748006794
Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?""Yes, and I had heard it before.	12.566032409434479
But what is that to me?	16.96230804633814
You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.	12.58014240833634
Its completion depended on others.	6.7976617315654355
If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?	9.919799857961323
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?""Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	7.725489614889556
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	13.299478114550405
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.""These are heavy misfortunes,"replied Elizabeth.	9.439639498587788
"But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.""Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?	11.114372854903376
"Let us sit down.	11.048046035002766
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.	8.67349064496407
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	10.55356344176305
Hear me in silence.	13.855700150026998
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.	8.675594429632154
They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	12.387759418146516
Their fortune on both sides is splendid.	6.9097131749802205
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be.	15.969499075673678
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up.""In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.	11.862796593867007
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.""True.	13.24080035744875
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	10.826410419283352
But who was your mother?	15.900795120066203
Who are your uncles and aunts?	6.608723665773062
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?""I will make no promise of the kind.""Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.	11.696109076889064
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.	12.699474598490252
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.	11.717122542098188
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require.""And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	10.57817757866779
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.	7.92280910935155
Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished - for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable?	9.185695544343176
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged.	11.272564703850257
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	10.07083976331767
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.	9.478617442435752
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.""Not so hasty, if you please.	10.599828709326921
I have by no means done.	11.106883480937272
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.	12.068061989656933
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched - up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	14.457995945437668
And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	14.933614064221866
Heaven and earth! - - of what are you thinking?	11.515681157726444
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?""You can _now_ have nothing farther to say,"she resentfully answered.	9.38441341232295
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.	12.556245293320028
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.	12.409040986584227
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	9.274502668209879
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?""Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.	10.832541005321984
You know my sentiments.""You are then resolved to have him?""I have said no such thing.	11.394228951435336
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.""It is well.	12.164740451040045
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	13.241323177782386
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	8.409444740941625
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern - - and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.""And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.	11.951025839694461
I shall now know how to act.	11.780237652312238
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.	11.68971550351616
I came to try you.	13.534912461551272
I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.	13.062994370442361
I send no compliments to your mother.	10.10275665005182
You deserve no such attention.	10.281004396774414
I am most seriously displeased."Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	9.279870280491457
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	9.075246647981123
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	12.08487419325215
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	11.899461952409288
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	13.435543440349651
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	8.978385485482745
Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.	8.791763670980488
It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.	11.429839337888982
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.	10.47244166203642
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.	10.3330865715154
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.	13.401113936571171
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.	11.465805368980806
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	8.059274745947995
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.	12.432831166700794
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days,"she added,"I shall know how to understand it.	11.403745225220748
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.	10.519354653520718
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."* * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.	10.50311240860889
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	9.432869072613748
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	16.3114160974423
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.	10.82985925603736
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	14.659727504568524
He then said,"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.	9.592714625753107
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.	10.904394804983802
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.	12.559564317351827
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,"You look conscious.	12.776567698139168
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.	9.216196801713956
This letter is from Mr. Collins.""From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?""Something very much to the purpose of course.	13.08221280042368
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good - natured, gossiping Lucases.	11.742555761746113
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.	6.149591443624778
Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	10.451767716026074
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.""Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?""This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire, - - splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.	10.023621112714107
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.""Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?	11.796940538162781
But now it comes out.""My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	10.835530932044453
We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.""_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.	11.595045468815409
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?	10.051327308056669
Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!"Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.	9.982114415433305
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.	9.45041989032893
Pray read on.""After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	11.657447806667914
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.""Mr. Collins moreover adds,""I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.	10.547339533676869
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.	8.958078412351172
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.""_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive - branch.	10.653396237488428
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.	11.375206074586442
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	12.865077137398535
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?""Oh!"cried Elizabeth,"I am excessively diverted.	10.313886007990137
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration.	9.55127295919492
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law.	10.14595891968533
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?	11.56570952140296
Did she call to refuse her consent?"To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.	11.229944600074207
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.	12.61302593514189
It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.	10.973451881160326
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	11.076152528205261
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.	10.738440366052956
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.	12.087905376050548
It was agreed to.	10.774376736344308
Mrs.	5.816950069042645
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.	10.08294549382622
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.	10.889950141544542
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.	14.506686162114237
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	11.460951268245735
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.	12.387721303666636
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.	9.015165282369356
I did not think Mrs.	11.328826281542254
Gardiner was so little to be trusted.""You must not blame my aunt.	14.315728338492935
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.	14.451165878422904
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.	12.73382201707526
But your _family_ owe me nothing.	6.19608976721378
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_."Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	14.92323476296515
After a short pause, her companion added,"You are too generous to trifle with me.	9.251795635432432
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.	8.646413578000452
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	10.376793317024761
The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	11.854064171812894
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.	11.13744456231425
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.	12.922070620351633
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	10.597800385153102
But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	9.426771538050856
"It taught me to hope,"said he,"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.	13.141683205963291
It was unpardonable.	9.948928803535384
I cannot think of it without abhorrence.""We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,"said Elizabeth.	11.312608883650398
The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	15.116174963482665
Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget:'had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner.'Those were your words.	7.962030621139088
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; - - though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.""I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.	11.74760640943762
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.""I can easily believe it.	11.49762547894505
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me.""Oh! do not repeat what I then said.	12.544098530387679
These recollections will not do at all.	12.18418661156736
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."Darcy mentioned his letter.	11.793371952837042
"Did it,"said he,"did it _soon_ make you think better of me?	11.854158938464163
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	11.459665171543241
There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.	11.049131952584432
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.""The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.""When I wrote that letter,"replied Darcy,"I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.""The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	10.133424062608213
The adieu is charity itself.	6.445584173423529
But think no more of the letter.	14.26994778498416
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	13.31508708919886
You must learn some of my philosophy.	13.487276840971237
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.""I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	10.068544902643648
_Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.	12.48381276305295
But with _me_, it is not so.	12.405760961709364
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	11.751675340559016
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	12.13200915006695
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.	10.855215316584266
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.	9.5048364799487
By you, I was properly humbled.	14.862137884466396
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.	15.936602317617751
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.""Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?""Indeed I had.	10.279893800907686
What will you think of my vanity?	19.352967273396207
I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.""My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.	9.973967176073588
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	9.359510828335416
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?""Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.""I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley.	10.591413278784906
You blamed me for coming?""No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.""Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	10.224364157108045
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.""My object _then_,"replied Darcy,"was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.	11.425563636023393
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.	10.663716224632076
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.	12.626752461551353
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.	12.284498297050652
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!"was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	8.402214822095004
"I must ask whether you were surprised?"said Elizabeth.	10.576189112629278
"Not at all.	11.679632954716938
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.""That is to say, you had given your permission.	13.872996872693058
I guessed as much."And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.	14.582842282243584
"On the evening before my going to London,"said he"I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	12.688119477746815
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.	10.951574527669383
He had never had the slightest suspicion.	12.295381937708916
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.	12.40200496280469
"Did you speak from your own observation,"said she,"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?""From the former.	11.655506863536134
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	8.965116123122002
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	9.188351499943984
I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	12.297661739079764
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	12.736933365645314
He was angry.	13.107289950944521
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	10.337014385747565
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.	11.531328738912702
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.	13.522061851001263
In the hall they parted.	11.439894571665148
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.	12.969651404604981
She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.	14.101475162212804
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	12.933936547827528
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	8.275938320680547
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	7.307583566783663
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.	10.279530625432145
At night she opened her heart to Jane.	8.8433373524669
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	10.35311542480722
"You are joking, Lizzy.	8.843177319070243
This cannot be! - - engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me.	13.463614717616055
I know it to be impossible.""This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	10.714462791580337
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.	14.341687604401129
He still loves me, and we are engaged."Jane looked at her doubtingly.	12.748310395303474
"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be.	13.12583285300106
I know how much you dislike him.""You know nothing of the matter.	12.244596847827005
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.	15.282228427759376
But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.	10.133653741832578
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	12.076626529374892
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"cried Jane.	9.417414801504204
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain?	13.177386481166632
forgive the question - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?""There can be no doubt of that.	15.780940187899684
But are you pleased, Jane?	16.07216081387472
Shall you like to have such a brother?""Very, very much.	16.649539306706725
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.	7.193068414038588
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	16.630210202724747
And do you really love him quite well enough?	13.689871035309007
Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection.	11.255819071146446
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?""Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all.""What do you mean?""Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.	12.635936848479515
I want to talk very seriously.	11.563111391474303
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	13.725749712189238
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	10.741523032854547
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.	9.124028689900488
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.	11.115964746557077
"Now I am quite happy,"said she,"for you will be as happy as myself.	12.919311240446703
I always had a value for him.	12.10718165246007
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.	13.06045146251034
But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	11.357151999265128
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you."Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	15.036948923098288
But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.	12.222131538882056
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.	13.660959062890555
* * * * *"Good gracious!"cried Mrs.	5.609732819312243
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.	10.374027281391118
What shall we do with him?	16.00784340925044
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.	11.486503231213623
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud,"Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day?""I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"said Mrs.	10.998333918847369
Bennet,"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.	7.805574121789694
Wont it, Kitty?"Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	14.829119229956609
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.	8.417578173810671
Bennet followed her, saying,"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.	12.184074147455103
But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.	12.409745755713601
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.	12.983412457193728
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.	10.82096999685533
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	10.244195276370382
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.	13.284099272738805
* * * * * In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.	10.577357164188378
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	12.316246429564295
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper,"Go to your father, he wants you in the library."She was gone directly.	12.183587438440615
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	10.405340956346638
"Lizzy,"said he,"what are you doing?	11.780694939172529
Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?	15.470675052811927
Have not you always hated him?"How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.	11.198489474762711
He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.	9.428075950530292
But will they make you happy?""Have you any other objection,"said Elizabeth,"than your belief of my indifference?""None at all.	10.097358778026571
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.""I do, I do like him,"she replied, with tears in her eyes,"I love him.	14.119525629582833
Indeed he has no improper pride.	11.703141804913981
He is perfectly amiable.	11.339426385052198
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.""Lizzy,"said her father,"I have given him my consent.	11.811472234495767
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	13.1248200836049
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.	13.147724828287917
But let me advise you to think better of it.	12.60636544207853
I know your disposition, Lizzy.	11.592947039991316
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.	6.990618381457986
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	8.967019769447845
You know not what you are about."Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	10.85652766331326
"Well, my dear,"said he, when she ceased speaking,"I have no more to say.	10.946747115800282
If this be the case, he deserves you.	13.972123858005816
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.	11.946955645898717
He heard her with astonishment.	11.362795492907646
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better.	9.335757830244
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.	7.530238857218574
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.	9.713444595577906
I shall offer to pay him to - morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go - - saying, as she quitted the room,"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.	12.167866145898866
Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.	10.379332148481758
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.	11.001087023780324
Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.	9.76928543766142
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.	12.548816419682659
She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.	10.499398955800027
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true?	8.698746694449044
Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin - money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it - - nothing at all.	10.557896455189539
I am so pleased - - so happy.	12.110330266251077
Such a charming man! - - so handsome! so tall! - - Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	10.0274074562798
I hope he will overlook it.	10.100097311404305
Dear, dear Lizzy.	14.55174099278588
But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.	15.423410419797975
"My dearest child,"she cried,"I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence.	8.375187319288122
You must and shall be married by a special licence.	10.642299264481336
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to - morrow."This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'consent, there was still something to be wished for.	14.370282403538331
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.	10.027817577510493
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.	11.630956128528803
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.	11.015972268493147
"I admire all my three sons - in - law highly,"said he.	8.003107688405846
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's."Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	10.885877032294246
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?""I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.	11.501354234825728
It is too long ago.	10.648716635428825
I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.""My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners - - my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	11.718088573334288
I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.	16.786821749749276
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.	10.009106266437868
There - - I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.	13.400918939006743
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me - - but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.""Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?""Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her?	11.52254607369651
But make a virtue of it by all means.	12.200741472934746
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.	10.326349258564125
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?	12.366122340809655
Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?""Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.""But I was embarrassed.""And so was I.""You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.""A man who had felt less, might.""How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	12.725501324973646
I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.	9.520626288720573
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?	11.16351720356654
This will never do.""You need not distress yourself.	10.890245694752647
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	8.934816696862448
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.	13.397264564291786
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.""Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.	12.97697859555287
But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?	15.61375370389488
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	8.793456429019924
or had you intended any more serious consequence?""My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.	12.086361085538014
But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.""And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	13.743467225492443
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over - rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.	10.252152672171102
Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.	11.758245175001216
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.	8.308292449943636
You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	12.560737874740925
I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.	15.459934407815195
How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	12.420409357486246
We will go round the Park every day.	9.949356937549343
I am the happiest creature in the world.	8.196500545636086
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.	14.766348529882556
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.	11.720120122594334
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me.	11.00920927146404
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	10.825556275939546
Your's, & c."Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.	12.128375496737577
"DEAR SIR,"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	9.849727329776496
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.	9.757166412095087
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.	15.644100350941565
He has more to give.	14.552802192152019
Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	11.37464700123655
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.	10.392922924271526
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.	10.401113447497547
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.	12.022454425514894
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.	11.96579031374352
He bore it however with admirable calmness.	7.21669291100668
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.	8.195082448930718
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.	10.582041040112188
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	11.20737305571258
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.	13.895052269841967
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.	5.625520599566661
Darcy may be guessed.	17.11081174106858
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well - informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.	11.472542253880794
He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	12.061793381688553
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	10.630709156685858
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.	13.632716970774137
In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.	11.137291234935477
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.	9.919918317489953
Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.	8.933763655359636
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters'beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.	11.053115164368029
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.	9.365993794934491
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	13.4157131560553
The letter was to this effect:"MY DEAR LIZZY,"I wish you joy.	8.843670525355423
It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.	15.419582727412608
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.	9.491881872527527
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.	13.338387423596494
"Yours, & c."As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	10.345777723883597
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.	12.19036106397329
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.	9.073265537056137
Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.	12.337843123290519
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.	10.09901680161509
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	11.870274323698021
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	11.339662546382645
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.	13.018123509533929
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.	10.979631985437644
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.	8.419302114512371
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.	10.25960942099966
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	11.82186165894601
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	13.999618117771169
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	12.347313369893676
