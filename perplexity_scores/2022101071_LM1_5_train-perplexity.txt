2475.252882733078
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	2306.2664272892493
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.	3028.835170132728
"My dear Mr. Bennet,"said his lady to him one day,"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.	2207.809751915241
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?"cried his wife impatiently.	2257.2877048599244
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."This was invitation enough.	2434.378416133517
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.	1915.064248974302
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.""What is his name?""Bingley.""Is he married or single?""Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.	2956.3708289508313
how can it affect them?""My dear Mr. Bennet,"replied his wife,"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""Is that his design in settling here?""Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.""I see no occasion for that.	2927.3553780668162
You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.""My dear, you flatter me.	2793.797445793049
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	2438.425464870206
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.	2881.362496320657
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	2716.8485160825226
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.""You are over scrupulous surely.	2650.005814821975
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.	2920.555806339919
But you are always giving _her_ the preference.""They have none of them much to recommend them,"replied he;"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.""Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	2730.348856978862
You take delight in vexing me.	2057.9695876252676
I have a high respect for your nerves.	1554.9753410194012
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.""Ah! you do not know what I suffer.""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	2826.1340406054956
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.	3223.054000588838
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.	2044.5419187733858
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	2458.3206776641746
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.	2621.572748980687
It was then disclosed in the following manner.	1506.9387721912549
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"said her mother resentfully,"since we are not to visit.""But you forget, mama,"said Elizabeth,"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.	2865.006270280575
Long has promised to introduce him.""I do not believe Mrs.	2256.0735284715174
Long will do any such thing.	2621.1752857137876
She has two nieces of her own.	1656.2400228811157
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.""No more have I,"said Mr. Bennet;"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."Mrs.	2294.612777487812
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	2478.747180390576
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves.	2561.408186229762
You tear them to pieces.""Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,"said her father;"she times them ill.""I do not cough for my own amusement,"replied Kitty fretfully.	2631.9759392945193
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?""To - morrow fortnight.""Aye, so it is,"cried her mother,"and Mrs.	2522.3059764448585
Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.""Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.""Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?""I honour your circumspection.	2945.4217664536445
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.	2558.919164084609
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.	2562.1480961384505
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.	2285.02247269672
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet said only,"Nonsense, nonsense!""What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"cried he.	2549.76952677657
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.	1564.751703064604
What say you, Mary?	2389.2801461922904
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts."Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	3070.5259362524907
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,"he continued,"let us return to Mr. Bingley.""I am sick of Mr. Bingley,"cried his wife.	2332.276085305345
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.	2563.4294851156965
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.	2550.6932278078093
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.	2741.8161498010377
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last.	2397.2117273104213
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.""Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,"said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	2723.5425063906523
"What an excellent father you have, girls,"said she, when the door was shut.	1875.5588410689218
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.	2003.832547159154
At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.	2856.732503386181
Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.""Oh!"said Lydia stoutly,"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest."The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.	2703.4213894663417
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.	2506.4881751394314
Her report was highly favourable.	2038.6403672203119
Sir William had been delighted with him.	2440.2943142384265
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.	2503.1066058751785
Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.	2689.517121691632
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"said Mrs.	1802.8527075698428
Bennet to her husband,"and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.	2703.7274164597516
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.	2537.7399615625577
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	2670.9697053125415
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.	2936.68151850423
Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, & c.	2094.9549757041336
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.	2587.4840971304907
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	2897.579787549709
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.	2799.273195561689
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman - like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	2071.2275657723358
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.	2301.6725995584975
His brother - in - law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	2851.196079999755
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.	2889.2206283005958
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.	2498.9903595063647
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.	2618.3658794591397
What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.	2640.3590388210964
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	2782.3060957823486
His character was decided.	1712.5968560682
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	2318.973805975296
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.	2285.3291747255835
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.	2816.76800247804
"Come, Darcy,"said he,"I must have you dance.	1884.4298492151206
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	2233.2283664411316
You had much better dance.""I certainly shall not.	2306.1672890185905
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	2422.4844636357802
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.""I would not be so fastidious as you are,"cried Bingley,"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	2920.904854742884
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.""Which do you mean?"and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.	3003.5912074867115
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."Mr. Bingley followed his advice.	2684.2146559890593
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	1822.0027245409376
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	2657.1702303208863
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	2002.231724147821
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.	2101.8800734554684
Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.	1868.0368645163144
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.	2027.2053735046775
They found Mr. Bennet still up.	2042.3812820571059
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	2844.0323708245887
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.	2535.7067289104843
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,"as she entered the room,"we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	2015.5207749572965
Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.	2761.3887944398957
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.	2878.059172960916
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	3079.712352739188
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	2916.5042682886356
Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger - - - -""If he had had any compassion for _me_,"cried her husband impatiently,"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners.	3027.9687298325357
Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!""Oh! my dear,"continued Mrs.	2210.6756329019163
He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women.	2075.3408096045073
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	1929.1208460594316
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.	1890.7634770846107
Hurst's gown - - - -"Here she was interrupted again.	2576.9487890497658
Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery.	1445.1426608194697
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.	2298.1423083920445
"But I can assure you,"she added,"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.	2340.7531065689795
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	2986.712255466223
I quite detest the man."When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.	2765.185843957045
"He is just what a young man ought to be,"said she,"sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! - - so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!""He is also handsome,"replied Elizabeth,"which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	2526.318483454663
His character is thereby complete.""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	2533.8298362299934
_I_ did for you.	2943.7194375525787
But that is one great difference between us.	1742.3750607789325
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	3183.311443368421
What could be more natural than his asking you again?	2478.0864674977947
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.	2348.3544846185305
No thanks to his gallantry for that.	2667.3242304568216
Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.	2467.4342757794793
You have liked many a stupider person.""Dear Lizzy!""Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	2626.979065863363
You never see a fault in any body.	2228.917105825125
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.	2762.073948216504
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.""I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.""I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	2656.0542696378557
With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough; - - one meets it every where.	2908.72145714718
But to be candid without ostentation or design - - to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad - - belongs to you alone.	2696.9021733691607
And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?	2385.145991110725
Their manners are not equal to his.""Certainly not; at first.	2663.6701476515796
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.	2246.7349214230394
They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.	2614.434708830101
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. - - Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.	2787.9348755021483
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.	2793.3696290175917
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.	2845.7692989739517
Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.	2134.725917465621
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. - - Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.	3054.754639382185
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	2634.7019437959925
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.	2483.4247618608856
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	2407.3151337987956
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	2672.736894264774
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.	2995.1564901534607
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.	2867.828599363363
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.	2397.979728017002
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.	2635.274509819026
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.	3074.055926051254
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	2869.533117878976
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	2051.9432179945543
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	2873.8875340788854
For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.	2851.0928605590607
By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.	2645.6124501947506
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.	2639.1964668184673
Bennet. - - They had several children.	1890.4568634387306
The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty - seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.	2611.543311661256
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	2885.404137280974
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,"said Mrs.	1585.0385645918707
Bennet with civil self - command to Miss Lucas.	2133.525052597628
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her - - indeed I rather believe he _did_ - - I heard something about it - - but I hardly know what - - something about Mr. Robinson.""Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?	2848.987202572211
Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	2561.468503133333
and his answering immediately to the last question - - Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.""Upon my word! - - Well, that was very decided indeed - - that does seem as if - - - - but however, it may all come to nothing you know.""_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,"said Charlotte.	2997.663582445395
"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? - - Poor Eliza! - - to be only just _tolerable_.""I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill - treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.	2767.0946229719425
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.""Are you quite sure, Ma'am? - - is not there a little mistake?"said Jane. - -"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.""Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; - - but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.""Miss Bingley told me,"said Jane,"that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	2930.6555944902843
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.	2201.261981347129
Long.	1539.6758731008151
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.	2896.1954506064435
If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.""That is very true,"replied Elizabeth,"and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.""Pride,"observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections,"is a very common failing I believe.	2676.985548297601
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	2896.7915550120497
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.	3153.8264552033042
I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.""Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,"said Mrs.	2271.0311884649263
Bennet;"and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly."The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	2817.276268396159
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	2121.2329907652725
The visit was returned in due form.	1962.3255922262217
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs.	2271.9055196108575
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	2998.8809753967967
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.	2851.361095060002
"It may perhaps be pleasant,"replied Charlotte,"to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.	2561.0190906590087
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	2571.1276616716523
We can all _begin_ freely - - a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.	2766.5629157414523
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.	2641.0796173381577
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.""But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.""Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	2932.606123873974
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.	2791.5956325625584
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.	2749.670409803564
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.""Your plan is a good one,"replied Elizabeth,"where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.	2819.2637919579233
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	2360.5035867880697
As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.	2748.751185669084
She has known him only a fortnight.	1656.2400228811157
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.	2647.0526297194237
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before - hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.	2816.51919829431
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.""You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	2894.2032793232197
You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.	2693.760558806985
Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	2411.858462251957
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	2753.906795194366
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	2374.944261129818
Of this she was perfectly unaware; - - to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.	2993.440836292778
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	2595.8331025070584
His doing so drew her notice.	2160.383505845306
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.	1971.622184352181
"What does Mr. Darcy mean,"said she to Charlotte,"by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?""That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.""But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.	2633.7243823792023
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?""With great energy; - - but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.""You are severe on us.""It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed,"said Miss Lucas.	2848.3864673528756
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.""You are a very strange creature by way of a friend! - - always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body! - - If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers."On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added,"Very well; if it must be so, it must."And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy,"There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with - -'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'- - and I shall keep mine to swell my song."Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	2836.5060120647495
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.	2905.701432540169
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.	2999.2280015034803
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.	2552.060241183422
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! - - There is nothing like dancing after all. - - I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.""Certainly, Sir; - - and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. - - Every savage can dance."Sir William only smiled.	2752.862133135799
Do you often dance at St. James's?""Never, sir.""Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?""It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.""You have a house in town, I conclude?"Mr. Darcy bowed.	2757.4584503637125
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? - - Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. - - You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. - - I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.	2888.5701514473126
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.""Mr. Darcy is all politeness,"said Elizabeth, smiling.	2490.2515126680423
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,"I can guess the subject of your reverie.""I should imagine not.""You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner - - in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	2826.515129693204
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people! - - What would I give to hear your strictures on them!""Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.	2630.961363637878
My mind was more agreeably engaged.	2199.4709061124004
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	2663.05067311536
How long has she been such a favourite? - - and pray when am I to wish you joy?""That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.	2857.78329213094
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.	2786.5303999261123
I knew you would be wishing me joy.""Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.	2587.6213754561245
You will have a charming mother - in - law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	2779.077269154723
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.	2431.4665359113997
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.	2596.466456496772
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.	2838.9049557309
The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.	2864.76772369201
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.	2838.628172754662
Their visits to Mrs.	2200.4367646390792
Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.	2644.4759781622574
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers'names and connections.	2735.7604089874208
Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	2776.2326068535563
Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.	2194.955634416946
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.	2644.9393740763153
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed,"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.	2870.8240081532426
I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.	2659.3518148776484
"I am astonished, my dear,"said Mrs.	850.8070206528483
Bennet,"that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.	1917.723429181608
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however.""If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.""Yes - - but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.""This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	2831.3833835489777
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.""My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. - - When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.	2700.172280634516
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well - - and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals.""Mama,"cried Lydia,"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."Mrs.	2923.303892071434
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.	2560.1772309558796
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
what does he say?	3088.2165139917147
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.""It is from Miss Bingley,"said Jane, and then read it aloud.	2568.2515315031906
"My dear Friend,"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête - à - tête between two women can never end without a quarrel.	2604.8106702621267
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.	3009.5479666519877
Yours ever,"CAROLINE BINGLEY.""With the officers!"cried Lydia.	3005.638760710824
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_.""Dining out,"said Mrs.	1741.4029172978042
They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?""They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.""But if you have got them to - day,"said Elizabeth,"my mother's purpose will be answered."She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.	2580.0873830372334
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.	2698.06314922606
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.	2592.255295599181
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.	2500.501950862003
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.	2421.242144080691
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"said Mrs.	1819.3789938637024
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	2243.1223101647292
Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.	2887.1458621868437
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better.	2597.289881044218
They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones - - therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me - - and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache there is not much the matter with me.	2817.9934475776167
"Yours, & c.""Well, my dear,"said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud,"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.""Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying.	2382.562734824258
She will be taken good care of.	1846.7743020552944
As long as she stays there, it is all very well.	2581.9799177700947
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage."Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse - woman, walking was her only alternative.	2734.6757482321063
She declared her resolution.	1533.2062818991246
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	1339.8761598283081
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.	2385.7284119796586
She was shewn into the breakfast - parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. - - That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.	2716.2911492960466
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.	2259.903885057296
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	2715.315571281289
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	1892.174763835143
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	2416.8299897670195
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.	2612.2640821777304
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	2762.6984300944264
She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	2446.192177149426
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.	2824.322968515766
The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	2812.1777170675173
The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.	2482.253761045302
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.	2774.1130611786825
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.	2399.166370532641
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.	2735.9729285902745
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	2803.985503585754
To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.	2642.711264373523
Jane was by no means better.	1990.1334249747194
The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	2893.4766304206555
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.	2736.1117117400113
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.	2837.2352611581728
She had very little notice from any but him.	1648.4080019290548
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	2792.452958229011
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	2582.4012679675334
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	2769.5867374604345
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.	1580.6781472855619
I could hardly keep my countenance.	1632.1744727856
Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?	3007.6304114222016
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!""Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office.""Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,"said Bingley;"but this was all lost upon me.	2900.6100998508605
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.""_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley;"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition.""Certainly not.""To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it?	2616.408751121054
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,"observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.""Not at all,"he replied;"they were brightened by the exercise."- - A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.	2401.3616553902457
Hurst began again.	2186.9506643954883
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.	2286.798067782017
But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.""I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.""Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.""That is capital,"added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	2621.7884620919867
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,"cried Bingley,"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.""But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,"replied Darcy.	2659.6204646027068
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.	2831.039272294972
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	2801.422974155476
Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	1400.89253581841
"Do you prefer reading to cards?"said he;"that is rather singular.""Miss Eliza Bennet,"said Miss Bingley,"despises cards.	2330.4559291036776
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into."Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.	2696.558320521142
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.""I wish it may.""But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	3029.6861202477294
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.""With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.""I am talking of possibilities, Charles.""Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card - table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.	2786.5125552148656
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"said Miss Bingley;"will she be as tall as I am?""I think she will.	2534.7506088888554
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller.""How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.	2572.320373067022
Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano - forte is exquisite.""It is amazing to me,"said Bingley,"how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are.""All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?""Yes, all of them, I think.	2811.8357768977817
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.	2338.564927957418
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	2611.526283151661
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	2091.57145913622
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.""Nor I, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley.	2251.120847330553
"Then,"observed Elizabeth,"you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.""Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.""Oh! certainly,"cried his faithful assistant,"no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.	2626.4358227265893
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.""All this she must possess,"added Darcy,"and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.""I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	2952.886263102056
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.""Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?""_I_ never saw such a woman.	2647.3849644587153
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."Mrs.	2827.1098822660965
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	2715.514566951545
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.	2661.619458356819
"Eliza Bennet,"said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.	2562.8522848403745
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.""Undoubtedly,"replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.	2662.7131506957203
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.	3071.902404550728
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.	2542.927171076704
Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.	2933.2605854804838
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.	2816.480992982993
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	2848.379402918713
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.	2885.8336002691412
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.	2763.2273624621234
The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.	2346.1088140732745
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	2166.4930895533125
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.	2480.7203465422467
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	2815.968043808562
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.	2618.3658794591397
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	1973.5901052063252
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.	1857.7979719854397
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.""Removed!"cried Bingley.	2590.891418452826
"It must not be thought of.	1387.2316668797998
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.""You may depend upon it, Madam,"said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."Mrs.	2485.882035983544
"I am sure,"she added,"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with.	2463.0391331240903
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.	2205.6575044345936
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.	1683.1484804371103
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease.""Whatever I do is done in a hurry,"replied he;"and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.	2764.913650864612
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?"cried he, turning towards her.	2104.4156644413024
"Oh! yes - - I understand you perfectly.""I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.""That is as it happens.	2370.0949622882235
It must be an amusing study.""Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	2289.99281220563
They have at least that advantage.""The country,"said Darcy,"can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.	2499.2542931431185
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.""But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.""Yes, indeed,"cried Mrs.	2521.1779072675595
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.	1895.407409176359
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town."Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.	2503.618485583985
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.	2084.6890487392907
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.	2180.7813935351032
The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?""When I am in the country,"he replied,"I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.	2651.390920612272
But that gentleman,"looking at Darcy,"seemed to think the country was nothing at all.""Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,"said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.	2417.6139133113825
"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.	1187.224546443911
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.""Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.	2820.604553444852
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	2524.8073525056707
What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley - - is not he?	2783.449199722696
so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! - - He has always something to say to every body. - - _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.""Did Charlotte dine with you?""No, she would go home.	3056.6983615497998
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	1989.8992327903193
For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	2597.3160129134258
But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.	2382.6692936012587
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain - - but then she is our particular friend.""She seems a very pleasant young woman,"said Bingley.	2528.9646611706007
"Oh! dear, yes; - - but you must own she is very plain.	2034.8093509115115
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.	2586.025850994047
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane - - one does not often see any body better looking.	2327.2472950946876
It is what every body says.	1344.164700996889
I do not trust my own partiality.	1222.0912847262066
Perhaps he thought her too young.	2592.7152715600937
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.""And so ended his affection,"said Elizabeth impatiently.	2866.2856654010934
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.	2246.77269197759
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!""I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,"said Darcy.	2595.791896167048
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	2056.4169619278296
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	2720.720112091521
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	2355.2418578831903
Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.	2190.7002327191926
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.	2227.0935460588157
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	1923.3381059225128
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.	3013.545578535387
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	2750.627777817529
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self - consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	2626.0507781540014
She was very equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	2508.945610309707
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	2574.1078506479125
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.	2350.209860162506
And when you have given _your_ ball,"she added,"I shall insist on their giving one also.	2240.160309888788
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations'behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	2829.128196306334
The day passed much as the day before had done.	2002.231724147821
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room.	2502.5254614794358
The loo table, however, did not appear.	2051.3718374356245
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.	1690.7348803491502
Hurst was observing their game.	2408.813694855011
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.	2638.3118597252687
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	2858.215494329915
"You write uncommonly fast.""You are mistaken.	1590.432753215312
I write rather slowly.""How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!""It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.""Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.""I have already told her so once, by your desire.""I am afraid you do not like your pen.	2720.991689709567
I mend pens remarkably well.""Thank you - - but I always mend my own.""How can you contrive to write so even?"He was silent.	2687.3780720823065
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.""Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? - - At present I have not room to do them justice.""Oh! it is of no consequence.	2809.638514684155
But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?""They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.""It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill.""That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,"cried her brother - -"because he does _not_ write with ease.	2755.4662332236117
He studies too much for words of four syllables. - - Do not you, Darcy?""My style of writing is very different from yours.""Oh!"cried Miss Bingley,"Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.	2653.038802688417
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.""My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them - - by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.""Your humility, Mr. Bingley,"said Elizabeth,"must disarm reproof.""Nothing is more deceitful,"said Darcy,"than the appearance of humility.	2611.5280991617574
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.""And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?""The indirect boast; - - for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.	2821.39926200435
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.	2596.4820067919845
When you told Mrs.	1922.220532025545
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself - - and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?""Nay,"cried Bingley,"this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.	2915.3065568154884
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.	2740.185668690089
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.""I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.	2859.9276963419343
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,'you would probably do it, you would probably not go - - and, at another word, might stay a month.""You have only proved by this,"cried Elizabeth,"that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.	2904.7042334385583
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.""Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?""Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself.""You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.	2856.61438624631
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.""To yield readily - - easily - - to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you.""To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.""You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.	2965.858810796881
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.	2840.7677302331413
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley.	1884.7906870792672
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.	2787.966806655952
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?""Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?""By all means,"cried Bingley;"let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.	2941.2764714650402
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	2761.7488056481147
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.	2559.644519826461
Arguments are too much like disputes.	3243.110958441556
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.""What you ask,"said Elizabeth,"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter."Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	2702.0860803491814
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.	2683.733139942877
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.	2756.7177397297028
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.	2622.15552663273
The supposition did not pain her.	1855.7874325813505
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.	2168.488797892349
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her - -"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"She smiled, but made no answer.	2917.8473248542755
He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.	2279.1073466864136
"Oh!"said she,"I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.	1875.534105189223
You wanted me, I know, to say'Yes,'that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.	2857.014926656127
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.	2593.1614781877756
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	2724.346956192086
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	2643.5621301618994
"I hope,"said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day,"you will give your mother - in - law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. - - And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.""Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?""Oh! yes. - - Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.	2726.253766752528
Put them next to your great uncle the judge.	3194.1014661681547
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.	2295.0530614704085
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.	1769.7725589450604
"I did not know that you intended to walk,"said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	2023.4225933785935
"You used us abominably ill,"answered Mrs.	1747.1955894890295
Hurst,"in running away without telling us that you were coming out."Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.	2690.0735282935843
The path just admitted three.	1727.2645730490492
Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said, - -"This walk is not wide enough for our party.	2075.4009294552743
We had better go into the avenue."But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,"No, no; stay where you are. - - You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.	2867.137391828385
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	2128.302613962198
Good bye."She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.	2887.8423766694887
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing - room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	2817.434774337983
Their powers of conversation were considerable.	2390.8928505437025
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.	2583.404921832559
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	2514.615971325007
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was"very glad;"but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	2783.7126120903717
He was full of joy and attention.	1523.2238170369503
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	2629.214060933723
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.	2654.977415841063
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.	2251.0033983098765
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? - - I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.""If you mean Darcy,"cried her brother,"he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins - - but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards.""I should like balls infinitely better,"she replied,"if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	2919.3713491638846
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; - - but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	2769.399765644806
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. - - I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	2843.9376515567105
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.	2513.8355400234855
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	2407.1492498243874
He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.	2659.2977378631986
"What could he mean?	1152.2326900787918
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,"said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.	1809.1324939151273
How shall we punish him for such a speech?""Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,"said Elizabeth.	2616.328222123228
"We can all plague and punish one another.	1873.8874440600948
Teaze him - - laugh at him. - - Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.""But upon my honour I do _not_.	2968.939576996148
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.	1765.7293386863428
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no - - I feel he may defy us there.	3072.542426069841
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	2669.6331538666122
Mr. Darcy may hug himself.""Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!"cried Elizabeth.	1684.0124498482683
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	2583.8628394550783
I dearly love a laugh.""Miss Bingley,"said he,"has given me credit for more than can be.	2202.5866534506376
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.	1922.4136092090675
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.""Such as vanity and pride.""Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	2534.484814312196
But pride - - where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	2691.7390951787597
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,"said Miss Bingley; - -"and pray what is the result?""I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.	2573.843508191584
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	1882.8321971805362
My temper I dare not vouch for. - - It is I believe too little yielding - - certainly too little for the convenience of the world.	2633.877105059651
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.	2328.8925618774206
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	2413.848454681789
But you have chosen your fault well. - - I really cannot _laugh_ at it.	2328.4748750158064
You are safe from me.""There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.""And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body.""And yours,"he replied with a smile,"is wilfully to misunderstand them.""Do let us have a little music,"- - cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. - -"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst."Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano - forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.	2953.1290944468815
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	2196.997906296924
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.	2666.726667380818
But Mrs.	823.0086948142413
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	2717.8608523538014
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. - - Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved - - nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	2889.2539380236462
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her - - that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.	2847.068114050271
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence - - Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.	2568.8350248056518
She attracted him more than he liked - - and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	2613.538129961393
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.	2866.1941028604906
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.	2776.209978918933
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. - - Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	2842.981066543549
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	1874.5811949455792
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. - - But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	2850.3176686252045
The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.	2613.802898159595
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread - bare morality to listen to.	2798.8779535093076
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.	3076.774064076802
Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.	3069.50809781908
"I hope, my dear,"said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning,"that you have ordered a good dinner to - day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.""Who do you mean, my dear?	2396.2218265295896
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.	2545.9049920540324
Bennet's eyes sparkled. - -"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure.	2225.561689052985
Why Jane - - you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. - - But - - good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day.	2890.084365897696
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.	2189.741752942148
I must speak to Hill, this moment.""It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,"said her husband;"it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	2633.5009152901557
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	2630.012675060563
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.	2696.6938543900983
It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.""Oh! my dear,"cried his wife,"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	2249.1458485877565
Pray do not talk of that odious man.	2926.4387286720435
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	2689.9193026012817
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	2318.524520328755
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.""No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	2658.7910137485355
I hate such false friends.	1554.0663135195255
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?""Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, <NUM> th <URL> DEAR SIR, The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance. - -"There, Mrs.	3032.1231868489585
Bennet."- - My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.	2872.638391091848
As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	2964.7487183761405
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends, - - but of this hereafter.	2703.548061207882
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well - wisher and friend, WILLIAM COLLINS.""At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace - making gentleman,"said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.	2631.789692242319
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.""There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.""Though it is difficult,"said Jane,"to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.	2907.439273746143
There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter, which promises well.	2344.7139831745953
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.	2738.092095064333
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	2543.934455262648
As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill - will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.	2652.2226770871985
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.	1791.014786519543
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	2015.3406420181323
His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.	2544.217702063196
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.	1817.6547985681932
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	2876.747628336803
Things are settled so oddly.""You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.""Ah! sir, I do indeed.	3041.639930912663
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.	1835.9120766292833
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.	2734.1457769452763
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.""I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, - - and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.	2709.597980081832
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.	2045.0233777781043
At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted - - - -"He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.	2657.768535184183
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.	1661.268859309877
The hall, the dining - room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.	2571.0109655273236
Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.	2198.245613052571
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.	2659.0698696494264
But here he was set right by Mrs.	1965.1748941590058
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	2484.634375889466
He begged pardon for having displeased her.	1909.3972264098163
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.	2555.0192858041205
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	3092.091541300103
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.	1340.4094956215004
Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.	1032.091195298366
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank - - such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.	2816.881428134173
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.	2333.839685927331
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.	2433.1402277309767
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	2579.864003065941
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself, - - some shelves in the closets up stairs.	2703.2676413475306
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,"said Mrs.	1419.8566917435394
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.	1848.3298114448623
Does she live near you, sir?""The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.""I think you said she was a widow, sir?	3027.225381830845
has she any family?""She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.""Ah!"cried Mrs.	2908.687719848249
And what sort of young lady is she?	1982.3914978043613
is she handsome?""She is a most charming young lady indeed.	2998.1470599247423
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.	2799.21368547658
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.	2700.788191103856
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.""Has she been presented?	2493.24276261024
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.""Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.	2607.3367004236206
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.	2778.1743919990554
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?""They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.	3003.262176914453
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.	2896.566238456027
Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. - - Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. - - Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	2706.3762465988852
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	2972.798840210209
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.	2257.3312097135513
I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	2791.492812643943
It amazes me, I confess; - - for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.	2627.255089412576
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.	2297.396305810716
Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	2172.3462208537567
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.	2594.871331422422
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.	2843.0737257664887
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self - importance and humility.	2960.1597089614966
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	3042.3009937426164
This was his plan of amends - - of atonement - - for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.	2864.8932481544975
His plan did not vary on seeing them. - - Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.	2885.7245508029437
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête - à - tête with Mrs.	2285.049427698424
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. - -"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say - - she could not positively answer - - but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; - - her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention - - she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth - - and it was soon done - - done while Mrs.	2967.876103380848
Bennet was stirring the fire.	1378.1605749723428
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	2242.2000703808844
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.	2810.1314600759692
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.	2915.8167313267904
Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.	2618.3658794591397
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.	2947.5791049334216
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.	2737.6235955384573
The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.	2642.811613603535
All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.	3009.1875275882667
Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.	2576.9831588929133
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	2801.8381688055797
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation - - a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.	2852.5204975867787
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.	2238.429035180234
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.	3076.774064076802
Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat - - a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.	2166.567151328602
What could be the meaning of it? - - It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.	2736.707075426288
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	2707.4039816320633
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	2617.578469156839
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.	2993.905629246725
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the - - - - shire.	2748.233856216166
Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	2063.913772168933
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.	1292.3294663173338
Bennet by admiring Mrs.	1686.8940246689199
Philips's manners and politeness.	2103.6680746500265
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.	2718.3576929029327
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs.	2352.29035237549
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing - room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.	2747.609735336391
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.	2893.7189600266274
Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing - rooms, and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.	2922.8421143234127
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.	2870.4657231586316
Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.	2893.8161998850414
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.	2890.570960860618
It was over at last however.	1261.6306040663444
The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	2680.5537111906256
The officers of the - - - - shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman - like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	2717.029626024788
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.	2764.409297919549
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.	2958.567119451294
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	2576.9387451085217
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.	2499.3839944183287
"I know little of the game, at present,"said he,"but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life - - - -"Mrs.	2175.381767561819
Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	2675.2267344777733
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.	2200.412286349354
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.	2959.036791597809
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.	2951.523973087634
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.	2145.419699333378
A clear ten thousand per annum.	2390.8928505437025
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself - - for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	2719.1679174487313
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. - - Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?""As much as I ever wish to be,"cried Elizabeth warmly, - -"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.""I have no right to give _my_ opinion,"said Wickham,"as to his being agreeable or otherwise.	2749.7961266693605
I am not qualified to form one.	1147.762947139756
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.	2006.0847762325661
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - - and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. - - Here you are in your own family.""Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	2632.989170175837
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.	1775.1689225816629
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	2424.3665692230006
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.""I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill - tempered man."Wickham only shook his head.	2786.2107721852803
"I wonder,"said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.	2368.163558136856
I hope your plans in favour of the - - - - shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.""Oh! no - - it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.	2247.148006260496
If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	2532.01032181472
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.	2531.5947169294823
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,"he added,"which was my chief inducement to enter the - - - - shire.	2139.9561492338207
Society, I own, is necessary to me.	3078.5545102606466
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.	1873.001186309208
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.	2776.209978918933
The church _ought_ to have been my profession - - I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.""Indeed!""Yes - - the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.	2800.1738027868173
He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.""Good heavens!"cried Elizabeth;"but how could _that_ be? - - How could his will be disregarded? - - Why did not you seek legal redress?""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.	2889.2858098089164
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it - - or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	2936.1925760508148
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.	3090.762648077518
I can recal nothing worse.	1444.7645950951276
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.""This is quite shocking! - - He deserves to be publicly disgraced.""Some time or other he _will_ be - - but it shall not be by _me_.	2644.4653113759655
Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.	2938.493134757324
"But what,"said she, after a pause,"can have been his motive? - - what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?""A thorough, determined dislike of me - - a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	2553.854279835806
Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.	2843.5679176220647
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood - - the sort of preference which was often given me.""I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him - - I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued,"I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	2881.6695924321984
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to - - but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.	2928.0168546174555
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.	2034.434173341852
"How abominable! - - I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! - - If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, - - for dishonesty I must call it.""It _is_ wonderful,"- - replied Wickham, - -"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; - - and pride has often been his best friend.	2855.9871859489967
It has often led him to be liberal and generous, - - to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.	2694.117398108233
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	2941.185296869815
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.""What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"He shook his head. - -"I wish I could call her amiable.	2788.764808505777
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.	2250.530009705392
But she is too much like her brother, - - very, very proud. - - As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.	2679.4844956045945
But she is nothing to me now.	1537.7127429666311
Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?	3028.7263578643506
How can they suit each other? - - Do you know Mr. Bingley?""Not at all.""He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	2701.4673119623108
He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.""Probably not; - - but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.	2619.181558691555
He does not want abilities.	1767.0021223845913
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.	2371.144277530981
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	3071.720694349092
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal - minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable, - - allowing something for fortune and figure."The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.	2891.599759812764
It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.	2244.0973557009465
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.	2955.4598562730944
"I know very well, madam,"said he,"that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things, - - and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	2390.6077169012615
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	2750.7279650729797
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,"she replied,"has very lately given him a living.	2126.406612154853
I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.""You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.""No, indeed, I did not. - - I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections.	2734.575964914993
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.""Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.	2750.319715492486
"Mr. Collins,"said she,"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.""I believe her to be both in a great degree,"replied Wickham;"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	2705.2208114863793
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.	2870.5572253684313
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.	2414.4545300212376
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.	2476.5840168302307
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.	3074.471485681085
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	2269.5433547984903
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs.	2444.5496924933045
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.	2522.10758273424
Jane listened with astonishment and concern; - - she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. - - The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.	2917.5266413089257
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.	3194.1014661681547
It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.""Very true, indeed; - - and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? - - Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.""Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.	2815.172240708723
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, - - one, whom his father had promised to provide for. - - It is impossible.	2827.100197245186
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.	2903.9282143900173
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?	2917.130006389275
oh! no.""I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony. - - If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.	2947.4124937638835
Besides, there was truth in his looks.""It is difficult indeed - - it is distressing. - - One does not know what to think.""I beg your pardon; - - one knows exactly what to think."But Jane could think with certainty on only one point, - - that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.	2783.191497519335
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.	2749.9977818434486
To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.	2422.9081121639597
Bennet's civilities.	904.4322769550076
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.	2269.80695354953
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.	2736.4239186353225
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.	2862.2453082890734
"While I can have my mornings to myself,"said she,"it is enough. - - I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	2233.9391093782356
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.	2921.1885879112297
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances: - - and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed.	2477.572293325115
Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.	2046.666878468366
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. - - It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	2689.1095326478858
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	2876.523535043843
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.	2700.1367983820783
Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	2028.6311416895612
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.	2944.2655431118046
No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; - - the very shoe - roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.	2932.3985849651112
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	3069.3438142591403
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	2973.384930627341
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	2575.2722675630334
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.	2487.219170549595
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.	2896.901601488697
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.	2374.6392954431385
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.	2128.302613962198
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	2573.112785400687
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.	2765.2304139290563
He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	2672.174501272206
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.""Heaven forbid! - - _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! - - To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! - - Do not wish me such an evil."When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	2838.803170843572
Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours'looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	2695.8418032266127
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.	2850.6144906193667
He replied, and was again silent.	1997.3497367365544
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. - - _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.	2886.3236482978045
"Very well. - - That reply will do for the present. - - Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. - - But _now_ we may be silent.""Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?""Sometimes.	2769.348004967917
One must speak a little, you know.	2597.434704035765
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?""Both,"replied Elizabeth archly;"for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. - - We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"said he.	2832.093431462204
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added,"When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."The effect was immediate.	2732.3964295968212
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends - - whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.""He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,"replied Elizabeth with emphasis,"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	2923.708281239104
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.	2914.110077623547
Such very superior dancing is not often seen.	2660.1043737150685
It is evident that you belong to the first circles.	1769.5910623919924
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.""I do not think we were speaking at all.	2787.071404527977
"Books - - Oh! no. - - I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. - - We may compare our different opinions.""No - - I cannot talk of books in a ball - room; my head is always full of something else.""The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes - - does it?"said he, with a look of doubt.	2803.127577964127
"Yes, always,"she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.	2635.728341679267
"I do not get on at all.	1180.8342438534237
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.	2858.2123794070726
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.	2785.509656423573
His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.	2764.5879177139977
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,"said Elizabeth angrily;"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.""I beg your pardon,"replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	2724.2993554722693
"Excuse my interference. - - It was kindly meant.""Insolent girl!"said Elizabeth to herself. - -"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	2732.7187308372154
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. - - Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	2984.4790228378656
"I want to know,"said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's,"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.	2178.1725741574683
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.""No,"replied Jane,"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.	2567.7930336662153
Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	2756.7610941477724
I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.""Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.""This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.	2439.298471273488
I am perfectly satisfied.	902.002228855213
Mr. Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before."She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.	2682.045318552075
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.	2782.407768421753
On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.	2929.3110472334133
"I have found out,"said he,"by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.	2024.5335957151906
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.	2717.730767770416
How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with - - perhaps - - a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! - - I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	2928.3342110110384
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.""You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?""Indeed I am.	2475.1125680998257
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.	2063.254628767163
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. - - Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom - - provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.	2923.150869532465
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.	2631.9560586281964
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself."And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.	3054.342491435458
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words"apology,""Hunsford,"and"Lady Catherine de Bourgh."- - It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.	2929.2947022359476
Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.	2259.5157235762317
Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	2323.5241154789915
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	1066.5083014943268
Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	1308.0549747519995
He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	2681.1061967520354
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.	2923.979707545374
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	2704.2912733965413
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	2629.819989219903
When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley. - - It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	2789.1501680977954
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.	2373.807515595285
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	2774.765212260296
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.	2375.7643928679777
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.	2605.587158227875
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.	2748.8735636589104
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?	2177.294520884582
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.""For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. - - What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? - - You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	2740.737250326406
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	2311.8908727751223
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.	2187.442385644972
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	2575.7227044974115
At length however Mrs.	1739.1254018595862
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	2643.048188320968
Elizabeth now began to revive.	1910.7758551211236
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.	2778.8568926764483
By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, - - but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	3000.3273275071588
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.	2858.367387032505
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. - - Elizabeth was in agonies.	2940.9477515534913
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.	2232.7679151743146
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.	2444.539989236835
She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.	2216.1319884423715
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,"That will do extremely well, child.	2440.12090375371
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. - - Others of the party were now applied to.	2990.2034124418406
"If I,"said Mr. Collins,"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. - - I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	2686.8189278749774
The rector of a parish has much to do. - - In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.	2717.9916883609976
He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.	2809.410552181287
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	2753.7547188463673
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.	2992.1127247493964
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	1789.3165289847957
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	2611.2036377674035
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.	2825.274092604511
There was no arguing upon such a project.	1854.9822685655956
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good - naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.	2498.787619120137
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	2335.9805332143287
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.	2415.145361668623
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs.	2532.7683615752703
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	2701.512199808185
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs.	2042.0541781876354
Darcy said nothing at all.	2489.1721969647765
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.	2071.3400705955037
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of"Lord, how tired I am!"accompanied by a violent yawn.	2926.283955447942
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.	2428.120816247795
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	2755.357158540444
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.	2705.6497438866127
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.	1926.1249478162383
Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.	1185.3297749907472
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	3044.6080510982447
On finding Mrs.	2059.0548503852665
Bennet instantly answered,"Oh dear! - - Yes - - certainly. - - I am sure Lizzy will be very happy - - I am sure she can have no objection. - - Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs."And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,"Dear Ma'am, do not go. - - I beg you will not go. - - Mr. Collins must excuse me. - - He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	2864.990227958131
I am going away myself.""No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. - - I desire you will stay where you are."- - And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added,"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction - - and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.	2791.5253347617877
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.	2077.403596714055
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	2518.071946793131
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.	2782.8863201401878
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	2766.92694416909
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.	3133.0060489334373
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying - - and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.	2918.7178119518326
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly - - which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	3094.087960508924
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford - - between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.	3011.408472506799
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot - stool, that she said,'Mr. Collins, you must marry.	2958.768479552142
This is my advice.	1908.982114851301
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.	2997.8897661315127
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	2735.1687312730355
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.	3100.6077338598516
But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place - - which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.	2835.8753286350216
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	2757.0305474366405
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	2924.9933094491353
"You are too hasty, Sir,"she cried.	1676.8422428116999
Let me do it without farther loss of time.	2359.960039580096
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.	3183.311443368421
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.""Upon my word, Sir,"cried Elizabeth,"your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.	2421.112201758106
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.	2415.856376012192
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.	2323.240333767005
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self - reproach.	2851.5560678486977
This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled."And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.""Really, Mr. Collins,"cried Elizabeth with some warmth,"you puzzle me exceedingly.	2970.2249955781854
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.""You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	2866.531390932749
My reasons for believing it are briefly these: - - It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.	2874.3573516570177
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	2938.2436122872828
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	2817.937764222281
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	2044.9453891034884
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.	2514.5190325438393
My feelings in every respect forbid it.	2113.149025516301
Can I speak plainer?	2751.512316844041
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart.""You are uniformly charming!"cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry;"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	2961.5921492764455
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.	1708.4956531976231
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast - room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	2731.5314489503744
This information, however, startled Mrs.	2414.7446430016976
Bennet; - - she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.	2742.9398009859906
"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,"she added,"that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.	1764.3255246527
I will speak to her about it myself directly.	1754.511561783337
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it.""Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,"cried Mr. Collins;"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	2788.9246412843345
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.""Sir, you quite misunderstand me,"said Mrs.	2703.033629639286
Bennet, alarmed.	877.5472136976572
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.	1923.0112361620875
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.	2568.069013089189
I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	2697.368433705224
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,"said he, when she had finished her speech.	1652.573434099576
"Of what are you talking?""Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.	2259.308328998966
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.""And what am I to do on the occasion? - - It seems an hopeless business.""Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.	2872.38122096124
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.""Let her be called down.	2840.1852402641684
She shall hear my opinion."Mrs.	1691.6148262401825
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.	2414.727372963139
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.	1523.0120872371915
Is it true?"Elizabeth replied that it was.	2867.976014142924
"Very well - - and this offer of marriage you have refused?""I have, Sir.""Very well.	2455.640239639049
We now come to the point.	2303.749449045435
Your mother insists upon your accepting it.	2287.085062208077
Is not it so, Mrs.	2636.3008939798992
Bennet?""Yes, or I will never see her again.""An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.	2464.1902383439733
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. - - Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_."Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs.	2750.300749641834
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	2202.898554623558
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?	1759.162616752894
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.""My dear,"replied her husband,"I have two small favours to request.	2482.2662976487145
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	3071.902404550728
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.	2537.9159955552263
She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.	2305.6588693555186
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering; - - and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	2681.5108271825557
Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.	2715.2989988414315
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	1651.1278086532925
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.	2718.507022121467
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	2753.7271516387827
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.	2877.7060428610803
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper,"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! - - What do you think has happened this morning? - - Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room, where Mrs.	2723.298467072984
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.	2629.3897595610288
"Aye, there she comes,"continued Mrs.	1969.6160969883201
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. - - Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.	2299.764408914243
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.	3074.055926051254
Those who do not complain are never pitied."Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	2993.413729281014
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.	2919.948722101308
In a doleful voice Mrs.	1649.0115470941575
Bennet thus began the projected conversation. - -"Oh! Mr. Collins!"- -"My dear Madam,"replied he,"let us be for ever silent on this point.	2720.195930696795
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.	3038.576088475875
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	3011.087615968328
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	2760.5030881425637
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	2745.2688000438493
But we are all liable to error.	1811.5395326665139
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	1654.0201787602225
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	2852.4113191719994
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	2774.491764051322
He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.	2834.2343640750987
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.	1962.3255922262217
Bennet's ill humour or ill health.	1474.046358087131
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.	2460.5606599176463
He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	2201.5950214927316
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	2847.66707792976
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over. - - To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	2862.763746091759
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	2805.586005800329
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	2834.696878204615
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	2970.653326123518
When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.	2721.106834094696
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	2534.4813562237673
You shall hear what she says."She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.	2854.166398215308
The next was in these words.	1617.7948983950305
"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.	2603.7893277069725
"It is unlucky,"said she, after a short pause,"that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.	2077.9469432546484
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? - - Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.""Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.	2863.3190271709345
I will read it to you - -"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	2826.3776093623446
It must be his own doing. - - He is his own master.	2311.5236414936294
But you do not know _all_.	1649.5615131481215
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.	2133.8129548348115
I will have no reserves from _you_.""Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.	2362.500692636936
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.	2816.056991732043
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.	2373.0037281499353
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?""What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"- - said Jane as she finished it.	2959.7917632304047
"Is it not clear enough? - - Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?	2788.0455673669703
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?""Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. - - Will you hear it?""Most willingly.""You shall have it in few words.	2914.6312581973116
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.	2455.398738908976
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."Jane shook her head.	2703.772923856041
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. - - No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.	2485.273216105465
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.	1865.3219181088884
She is not such a simpleton.	1430.038498911722
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	2984.970157875868
But the case is this.	1411.7273574880874
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.	2941.201477963143
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.""If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"replied Jane,"your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	2747.9730310918567
But I know the foundation is unjust.	1492.0709236176062
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.""That is right. - - You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.	2969.464614865342
A thousand things may arise in six months!"The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.	2832.1109788423305
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.	2824.0190663682633
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	2531.369038800434
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	2887.031110057273
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	2863.458506856151
After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.	2962.459437427879
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.	2617.2567892895963
"It keeps him in good humour,"said she,"and I am more obliged to you than I can express."Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	2458.2462768885366
This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; - - its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.	2716.2211512373738
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.	2377.0334128046456
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	2795.7635703941714
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	2449.6092826852473
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	2787.9728465249786
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.	2850.880304628899
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	2676.0983588273884
Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.	2173.8344321742447
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's.	2837.7595524231633
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	2033.814205760333
The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.	2759.179639879572
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	2733.7094720664936
She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	1945.2307694776146
Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.	2156.7764373138025
But still he would be her husband. - - Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.	2863.7317300602967
This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty - seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	2831.4980328212237
The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.	2682.4749982476196
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.	2673.2376926037177
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	2642.365101482697
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.	2743.043853734248
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	2696.4073828788146
"My dear Madam,"he replied,"this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? - - You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness.""My dear sir,"replied Mr. Collins,"I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.""You cannot be too much on your guard.	2746.226448864827
As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	2879.417135763274
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	2741.7882155542716
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.	2849.322460191874
"I see what you are feeling,"replied Charlotte, - -"you must be surprised, very much surprised, - - so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.	2490.7184576328964
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.	2434.7897682144944
I am not romantic you know.	1015.0665196648706
I never was.	973.3048091379999
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."Elizabeth quietly answered"Undoubtedly;"- - and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.	2699.9772037810744
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	2895.308836147987
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.	2046.9321099683775
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.	2602.068601307533
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture! - - And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.	2883.1110743384615
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	2831.1951819900833
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.	2588.357124425825
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	2779.119959454269
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	2988.0839498660607
Nothing could console and nothing appease her. - - Nor did that day wear out her resentment.	2826.769117726673
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	2786.0740509864527
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.	2890.903452271131
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.	2586.025850994047
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.	2721.4057649801994
Bennet's sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.	2126.2408565948585
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	3044.2376032914103
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	2916.997618276704
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	2714.616287645249
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.	2982.67660109679
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.	1597.5968858411986
Bennet.	450.3779225555953
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.	2392.8455889150023
Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.	1876.2475898885057
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.	3102.3281330434456
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.	1936.802628057055
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.	3106.6516641626627
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	2799.890581003011
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.	2227.7025307590934
He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company.	2562.0138656374934
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	2751.303639460369
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	1751.9592811489622
As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	2611.7535965941934
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.	2979.1917402638624
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"said she,"it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!""My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	2352.19179776675
Let us hope for better things.	2298.3995863339082
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	2394.7642844584143
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it.""What should not you mind?""I should not mind any thing at all.""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.""I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.	2783.635754097628
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! - - Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?""I leave it to yourself to determine,"said Mr. Bennet.	2808.5924369349077
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	2145.203738317685
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.	2767.554107542349
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.	3070.4341386512347
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.	2832.856339952396
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.	2378.581269557765
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.	2380.0714917177174
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	2517.880019677634
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.	2627.342710074546
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.	2904.895307982039
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	2084.933282830588
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends'interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	2835.9668273554116
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.	2775.455501502622
Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	2616.749933527774
But I will not repine.	1005.6077614059736
It cannot last long.	1417.6078151349132
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.	2552.083910690929
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.	2008.3340108083466
Thank God! I have not _that_ pain.	2992.425588077823
A little time therefore. - - I shall certainly try to get the better."With a stronger voice she soon added,"I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself.""My dear Jane!"exclaimed Elizabeth,"you are too good.	2910.0093068537813
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.	2669.475673478771
"Nay,"said Elizabeth,"this is not fair.	1657.2904594546892
_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.	2999.243381494392
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.	2829.419267556823
You need not.	1377.4183773990728
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.	2488.83195927309
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.	2802.2576151267363
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.	2242.869852248479
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.	2211.645579493551
Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.	2721.598121290301
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.""To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.	3068.2512761971916
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.	2204.9452843647005
You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.""I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"replied Jane,"and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.	2721.9362890189655
But enough of this.	1562.6542783334069
You alluded to something else.	1943.951414474562
You mentioned _two_ instances.	1801.692530537418
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.	2566.580397629696
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.	2480.137204351645
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.	1859.6026171623714
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.""And do you impute it to either of those?""Yes; to the last.	2922.9232988511767
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.	2383.166131822821
Stop me whilst you can.""You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.""Yes, in conjunction with his friend.""I cannot believe it.	2893.662627029067
Why should they try to influence him?	2437.5871489637325
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.""Your first position is false.	2761.737195137208
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.""Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,"replied Jane;"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	2903.1475626093893
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.	2541.510132017434
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.	2332.790950725869
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?	2797.457221660323
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	2796.639602164772
By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.	2916.5494920487226
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken - - or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	2419.353666474909
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	2691.861947925226
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.	2821.576534004097
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	2933.06258325311
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.	2031.290680120537
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.	1222.609653843146
"So, Lizzy,"said he one day,"your sister is crossed in love I find.	2409.2175185164624
I congratulate her.	1284.032297070475
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	3073.349603584195
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.	2167.0585394687328
When is your turn to come?	2160.383505845306
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.	2005.0987028988427
Now is your time.	2943.7194375525787
Let Wickham be _your_ man.	2476.388483749762
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.""True,"said Mr. Bennet,"but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.	2637.9149472497757
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.	2529.717707601246
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.	2742.188570167883
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes - - but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	2864.64817368652
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.	2689.797354870016
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	2693.4721407695474
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.	2682.625751433093
On the following Monday, Mrs.	1883.5098984198296
Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman - like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	2219.3785033552285
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.	2734.2787917237383
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.	1790.5968198729165
Bennet and Mrs.	1201.6969978491568
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	2709.2697012286817
Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.	3020.176095410557
They had frequently been staying with her in town.	1990.2409443712852
The first part of Mrs.	1630.095637016643
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	2395.7230910627836
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.	2476.3661148007145
It became her turn to listen.	1927.797777297317
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	2101.8800734554684
They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister.	2278.220177068532
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.	3032.9872210068343
"I do not blame Jane,"she continued,"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could.	1966.593993741353
But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.	2318.8708576588774
He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.	2409.587589000703
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.	2694.091836454715
The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.	2128.302613962198
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.	1733.4524617935565
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."Mrs.	2713.2190693114226
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	2389.2694552569546
"I am sorry it went off.	1057.3203699883466
But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.""An excellent consolation in its way,"said Elizabeth,"but it will not do for _us_.	2711.2084682505238
We do not suffer by _accident_.	2303.702507037465
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.""But that expression of'violently in love'is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	2906.4475637908563
He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	2068.9323730264496
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	2748.9645912286383
Could there be finer symptoms?	2794.512635379856
Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.	3007.650839877605
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?	2193.140243382254
Change of scene might be of service - - and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.	3050.5008073131603
"I hope,"added Mrs.	1066.630652861404
Gardiner,"that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.	2188.484707546101
We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.""And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it?	2929.3262396505984
Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.""So much the better.	2445.4090705634603
I hope they will not meet at all.	1750.9487862834767
_She_ will not be able to help calling.""She will drop the acquaintance entirely."But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	3008.7490667899624
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re - animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.	2516.3166332666424
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.	2867.8323162217284
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.	2590.50842039419
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.	2521.3301871472363
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.	2715.37713913687
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	2379.626108901427
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.	3090.332750550969
To Mrs.	1790.8862637667478
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.	2309.613241468314
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.	2384.0076679089325
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.	3207.097781346334
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.	2856.7531288153364
On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill - natured boy.	2843.419936021092
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.	2772.367174538055
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.	3077.5899740564087
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.	2847.747347367054
I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.	2524.8583588638335
But as it is - - you must not let your fancy run away with you.	2357.1151322513283
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.	2428.346787536843
You must not disappoint your father.""My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.""Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.""Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	2435.2351699205146
I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.	2036.3941435524782
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.""Elizabeth, you are not serious now.""I beg your pardon.	2483.9780171832344
I will try again.	1101.602593835745
At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	2467.7882353223167
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not.	2672.7329378713366
I see the imprudence of it. - - Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! - - My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	2642.3527686453444
My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.	2094.1253327551904
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?	2940.3113215277194
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.	1944.4127329788325
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him.""As I did the other day,"said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile;"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	2721.9949216536984
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.	2029.632295957059
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.	2030.42782246992
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.	2359.576985577409
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied."Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.	2844.9630434061974
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.	2378.705073068434
Bennet.	450.3779225555953
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she"_wished_ they might be happy."Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.	2915.501506405184
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.""_That_ you certainly shall.""And I have another favour to ask.	2788.2467433940915
Will you come and see me?""We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.""I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.	2670.5846241985687
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.	2973.7058610758927
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March,"added Charlotte,"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.	2273.347127752996
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.	3016.887429506018
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.	2794.315192279196
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	3033.872054102717
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.	2411.9517632239595
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.	2670.2473652308618
It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.	2333.1477261949744
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	2833.147345981098
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.	2606.134275911111
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.	2629.0712542300553
"My aunt,"she continued,"is going to - morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor - street."She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	2606.547983100505
"I did not think Caroline in spirits,"were her words,"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.	2464.8033219136305
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	2006.2807756742643
He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	2134.5656784772013
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	2064.61643838927
I wish I could see her.	1528.9301817812122
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.	2457.2541266889534
Hurst were going out.	2313.758981232298
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.	2590.857673596564
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.	2867.4851061384375
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.	2551.5289295181756
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.	2925.169097427694
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	2429.9472344262545
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.	2444.510771995633
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	2572.058698797183
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.	2363.82236675239
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.	3071.7021488947003
When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	2894.430980823004
I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.	1989.8992327903193
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.	2350.4859053548053
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.	2534.4333266778062
I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	2592.0932609913325
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.	2746.637261227763
I cannot understand it.	1117.6639970583906
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.	2700.9964395420893
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	2425.658235845824
Let me hear from you very soon.	2226.454028039195
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.	2615.829380356106
We had better not mention it.	2081.715035729301
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.	2958.293140420919
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.	1353.2678633172475
"Your's, & c."This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	2389.4567239723165
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	2735.904255161618
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	2092.4658943416566
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.	2768.6068431556455
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.	2810.0812194983123
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.	2724.564491277584
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: - -"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.	2856.990341311271
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.	2506.3693575590355
There can be no love in all this.	2038.1728929111812
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	2840.7690218798084
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.	2701.497201925626
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.	2848.2161943809206
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.	3223.054000588838
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.	3073.625003680291
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.	2715.449687501144
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	2785.7727994532042
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.	1705.1052451143694
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	2825.5043489971613
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her - - their opinion of every body - - would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	2977.075849398282
Her fellow - travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.	2693.350965899988
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty - headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.	2892.668082057192
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.	2493.530077033542
It was a journey of only twenty - four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch - street by noon.	2264.675715368484
As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.	2834.075114161204
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	2729.3380626292947
All was joy and kindness.	2418.8274948287744
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	2478.089610577121
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	2202.2212763415637
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.	2836.2637356933124
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	2691.2758313135173
"But, my dear Elizabeth,"she added,"what sort of girl is Miss King?	1880.7726229494695
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.""Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	2527.5019205678896
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	2992.425588077823
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.""If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.""She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.	2948.7707598766206
I know no harm of her.""But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune.""No - - why should he?	2539.024731964898
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?""But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event.""A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.	2918.7684718216537
If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?""_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	2764.546468926347
It only shews her being deficient in something herself - - sense or feeling.""Well,"cried Elizabeth,"have it as you choose.	2375.4302648374055
_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.""No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.	2888.0376474819755
I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.""Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.	2641.5305308197526
I am sick of them all.	1224.87847122362
Thank Heaven! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	2970.3852839149476
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.""Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	3045.4345301751196
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,"said Mrs.	1744.4124310939046
Gardiner,"but perhaps to the Lakes."No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	2577.592860770585
"My dear, dear aunt,"she rapturously cried,"what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.	2189.194933072552
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.	3269.0819840970694
What are men to rocks and mountains?	2414.3960508332298
Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	2831.8531540670742
Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.	3104.2629893494473
Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	2990.2077033659616
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	2690.7377014318395
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.	2251.3923863835666
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	2493.479272129373
The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.	2670.097381634573
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.	2361.2863152788964
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.	2418.7513517685616
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.	2815.3923353820733
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	2709.9532446107164
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	2674.390217909882
When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.	2606.784433776027
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	2943.2201596741115
He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	2513.5898733381996
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.	2794.874734173117
It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.	1672.2192299264057
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.	3007.0736823334855
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	2488.5229142687767
When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.	2676.4137850219663
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	1792.089442483534
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed,"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.	2669.4093988363825
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.	2466.2824898388776
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.	2304.371877187492
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.	2680.5603951261783
I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.""Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"added Charlotte,"and a most attentive neighbour.""Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.	2665.521051825609
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.	2856.865869762474
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.	2341.5850053662293
A lively imagination soon settled it all.	2457.973447011143
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	3025.9653480877587
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining - room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.	2734.8569392063782
Make haste, and come down this moment."Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining - room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.	2951.1796516503405
"And is this all?"cried Elizabeth.	1479.4326910836714
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!""La! my dear,"said Maria quite shocked at the mistake,"it is not Lady Catherine.	2471.7645354638507
The old lady is Mrs.	1727.2645730490492
Jenkinson, who lives with them.	2592.7152715600937
The other is Miss De Bourgh.	1855.7874325813505
Only look at her.	2836.3285864109084
She is quite a little creature.	1430.038498911722
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!""She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	2985.8332521168263
Why does she not come in?""Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	2751.9865980426534
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in.""I like her appearance,"said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	2284.8462590050885
"She looks sickly and cross. - - Yes, she will do for him very well.	2317.811644411527
She will make him a very proper wife."Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.	2823.7429587802685
Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.	2422.2709001671433
Mr. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	1342.5487568186452
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	2754.3712643499293
"I confess,"said he,"that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.	2218.833120562387
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.	2279.344347359489
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!""I am the less surprised at what has happened,"replied Sir William,"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	3032.556642173023
About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.	3034.3601942184296
Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	2284.952096075118
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	2323.9529294159074
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.	2543.164445819383
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.	2468.4213787815875
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.	2389.2485577357384
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. - - Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	2961.586572992343
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. - - Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	2762.1366033601116
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.	2550.044966357954
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti - chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.	2865.4202518756106
Jenkinson were sitting. - - Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.	2892.942674293436
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.	2921.5550597304878
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	2821.7597242767483
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. - - Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly - marked features, which might once have been handsome.	2767.0803836273367
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	2747.689359842604
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self - importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.	2637.374611315775
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.	2748.4856733848947
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.	2297.1551484681136
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.	2917.5642097779096
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.	2849.113091885207
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.	2680.0543529891183
The party did not supply much conversation.	1962.3255922262217
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh - - the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.	2768.679028921867
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	3139.98229745342
When the ladies returned to the drawing - room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.	2711.905619468287
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.	2816.2430357928597
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.	2658.371974221183
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.	1930.181095865096
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.	2784.872899369417
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	2365.2849921601883
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? - - Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. - - Lady Catherine then observed,"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.	2908.2224951757294
For your sake,"turning to Charlotte,"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. - - It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. - - Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?""A little.""Oh! then - - some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	2806.8526933177704
Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to - - - - You shall try it some day. - - Do your sisters play and sing?""One of them does.""Why did not you all learn? - - You ought all to have learned.	3031.792194873717
The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's. - - Do you draw?""No, not at all.""What, none of you?""Not one.""That is very strange.	2599.575689090678
But I suppose you had no opportunity.	1492.0709236176062
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.""My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.""Has your governess left you?""We never had any governess.""No governess! How was that possible?	2933.0255274790106
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.	2743.971817094068
"Then, who taught you?	1578.3942473878965
who attended to you?	3088.2165139917147
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.""Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.	2982.9457734148523
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	2523.2801078847915
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.	2125.6436963220494
Four nieces of Mrs.	2836.3285864109084
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.	2913.735140717428
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?	2542.2677781260677
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	1823.3871358426413
'Lady Catherine,'said she,'you have given me a treasure.'Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?""Yes, Ma'am, all.""All! - - What, all five out at once?	2824.0701560394973
Very odd! - - And you only the second. - - The younger ones out before the elder are married! - - Your younger sisters must be very young?""Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	2919.6388203566767
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. - - The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.	2812.3629224336937
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, - - therefore you need not conceal your age.""I am not one and twenty."When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.	2426.8172424503437
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.	2856.3918570984233
Jenkinson to make up her party.	2727.5092564532165
Their table was superlatively stupid.	2307.329348099017
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.	2962.2082399746655
A great deal more passed at the other table.	2466.3865445363704
Lady Catherine was generally speaking - - stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	2560.5358332235605
Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	2204.8636865233416
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.	1814.4760296159172
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.	2685.613728881309
Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	2187.8991859617363
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands.	2620.0811635207247
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.	2935.68088419879
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	2128.302613962198
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	2929.4751309786916
From the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.	2955.036023418157
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes'conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	2657.1851690691647
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.	3042.85234517256
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.	3041.970678555314
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.	2851.199348308932
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.	2927.4843791172325
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.	2779.8309627324224
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses'reach.	2786.5303999261123
This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.	2919.8927962872153
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	2867.3195595879
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.	3110.126088706786
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.	2928.7041143439396
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.	2321.2461333694796
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord - - - - and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	2872.208431588915
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.	3017.108129265349
Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door - bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	2497.457140077916
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.	2801.455848901922
Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.	2162.9466929606137
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	2175.291067598172
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.	2899.8018505505047
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	2173.692854409299
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.	2554.926544223777
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	2326.0773285612318
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.	2820.959463288702
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter - day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.	2771.0496729425076
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.	2875.3743338959102
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.	2758.175730715535
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.	2551.444366538353
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.	2777.1566086555717
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	2343.2593255484458
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud.	1824.0233677624087
It is of all subjects my delight.	1473.1918114292835
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	2173.251395277196
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	2647.850051935861
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	2791.9495943549723
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,"said Lady Catherine;"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal.""I assure you, Madam,"he replied,"that she does not need such advice.	2434.622280414619
She practises very constantly.""So much the better.	1792.1677354737446
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	2536.023743204332
I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.	2492.7628271330427
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.	2289.3697722107554
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	2764.5712238474025
He drew a chair near her.	1893.0917342896107
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.	2875.200738285463
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?	2602.247579315242
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	1822.7347508159608
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.	2376.4277131715285
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.	2552.6922956189946
Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire - - and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too - - for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.""I am not afraid of you,"said he, smilingly.	2690.193442798623
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.	2419.7639884096325
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball - - and at this ball, what do you think he did?	2660.9227450202425
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	2728.461514768075
Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.""I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.""True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	2440.1205066918005
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	2289.241826518617
My fingers wait your orders.""Perhaps,"said Darcy,"I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.""Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.	2790.905045939697
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?""I can answer your question,"said Fitzwilliam,"without applying to him.	2752.098520496924
It is because he will not give himself the trouble.""I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"said Darcy,"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.	2451.212615595414
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.""My fingers,"said Elizabeth,"do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.	2522.277030176339
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault - - because I would not take the trouble of practising.	2608.732609880384
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."Darcy smiled and said,"You are perfectly right.	2394.7421773576257
You have employed your time much better.	1844.3499735129337
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	1803.2833147566903
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.	2784.84608936245
She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.	2355.223536674821
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	3082.5044667846482
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.	2586.8553578959068
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.	2766.1455858938198
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.	2804.4513149743257
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.	2732.319253822844
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	2672.7621443567637
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	2678.1296895493024
It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.	2838.636681677231
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.""Perfectly so - - I thank you."She found that she was to receive no other answer - - and, after a short pause, added,"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?""I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	2876.2717878572257
He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.""If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.	2799.777952857581
But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.""I should not be surprised,"said Darcy,"if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."Elizabeth made no answer.	2629.0936763933473
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.	2477.447152367963
He took the hint, and soon began with,"This seems a very comfortable house.	2216.1342697762334
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.""I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.""Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.""Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.	2788.2254881829786
My friend has an excellent understanding - - though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.	2806.794744482045
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.""It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.""An easy distance do you call it?	2854.9726902688685
It is nearly fifty miles.""And what is fifty miles of good road?	2020.7663285545786
"I should never have said Mrs.	1301.4754553247226
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.	3068.882109895946
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	2421.26536140756
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	3025.3432484729
But that is not the case _here_.	1636.2733385814868
Mr. and Mrs.	434.60244753918306
Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance."Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,"_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.	2863.337618083242
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn."Elizabeth looked surprised.	2966.032089622867
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,"Are you pleased with Kent?"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise - - and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.	2879.6094972194746
"What can be the meaning of this!"said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.	1961.5357296957166
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.	2782.9431396241316
All field sports were over.	2563.0122216516675
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.	3049.929198792116
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	2692.7459726457428
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.	2808.819810156232
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.	2505.3133611440517
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice - - a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	2847.406078796615
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Collins knew not what to make of him.	2513.0724257296474
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.	2528.718402253859
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.	2384.8081652283254
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.	2321.0621720016047
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	2940.7116764284865
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.	2568.069013089189
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. - - She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers. - - How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd! - - Yet it did, and even a third.	3013.7630668260044
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs.	2694.065730826297
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	2910.3831857191303
His words seemed to imply it.	2160.383505845306
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	2681.263804426934
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.	2559.5434716701916
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re - perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.	2597.9946388399994
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.""I have been making the tour of the Park,"he replied,"as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	2821.152428760512
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"said she.	1965.4117616821538
He arranges the business just as he pleases.""And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.	2653.3807643750697
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.""He likes to have his own way very well,"replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	2403.0013318423084
"But so we all do.	1382.6227551127959
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self - denial and dependence.""In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.	2874.6646958953634
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?""These are home questions - - and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.	2872.639375398969
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.	2245.8235024001506
Younger sons cannot marry where they like.""Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.""Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.""Is this,"thought Elizabeth,"meant for me?"and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone,"And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	3040.7520072051316
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	3107.557657060571
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.	2196.5792574269108
But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.""No,"said Colonel Fitzwilliam,"that is an advantage which he must divide with me.	2562.7718802672766
Does your charge give you much trouble?	2984.25228923396
She directly replied,"You need not be frightened.	2168.518255652172
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	2249.3695686705714
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.	1955.4072471998902
Hurst and Miss Bingley.	1165.9485751499049
I think I have heard you say that you know them.""I know them a little.	2308.9345306262876
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man - - he is a great friend of Darcy's.""Oh! yes,"said Elizabeth drily - -"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.""Care of him! - - Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.	2755.231542182893
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.	2890.4165459633164
It was all conjecture.""What is it you mean?""It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing.""You may depend upon my not mentioning it.""And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.	2644.584556091704
"He only told me, what I have now told you."Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.	2263.226812474086
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.	2681.034072459239
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	2021.4453519079989
Why was he to be the judge?""You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?""I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.""But,"she continued, recollecting herself,"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	2923.90231621036
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.""That is not an unnatural surmise,"said Fitzwilliam,"but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.	2620.2109794008056
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	1972.8578873913148
There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence.	2691.8468686823585
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.	2753.8160050707343
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	2841.879775027357
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.	2555.7534952391966
"To Jane herself,"she exclaimed,"there could be no possibility of objection.	2419.7639884096325
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	2896.74691691398
Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach."When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.	3050.1242246758384
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	2830.383601271971
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	2662.388996168883
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	2794.817737886276
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.	2688.4530347624186
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	3022.457470528277
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	2760.7260318826434
She answered him with cold civility.	1589.5173638062272
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	2366.169107017247
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,"In vain have I struggled.	2703.7219411863794
It will not do.	1375.2163210165484
My feelings will not be repressed.	2017.0059047218535
This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.	2814.04120710469
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.	2695.2888994971045
His sense of her inferiority - - of its being a degradation - - of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.	2906.045300986281
She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.	2467.8363725314107
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.	2795.506600087118
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.	2626.2967233592285
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.	2371.144277530981
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.	2927.691371634859
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	2302.0105470156473
But I cannot - - I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.	2313.493115660288
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.	1554.640037192278
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.	2330.5863289348954
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.	2732.183513925216
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.	2665.8800628188787
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.	2831.273018775463
But it is of small importance.""I might as well enquire,"replied she,"why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	2758.185835401978
But I have other provocations.	1100.0146329596864
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	2958.9722844813655
With assumed tranquillity he then replied,"I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	2898.440582008121
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself."Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	3104.2493127963303
"But it is not merely this affair,"she continued,"on which my dislike is founded.	2056.620191911912
On this subject, what can you have to say?	2597.868917867844
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	2464.9762987091904
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?""You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,"said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	3049.23113692438
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?""His misfortunes!"repeated Darcy contemptuously;"yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.""And of your infliction,"cried Elizabeth with energy.	2791.127431436125
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.	2378.3868115233545
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.	2534.488412391689
You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.""And this,"cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully.	2830.299861867763
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,"added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her,"these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	2916.703167725534
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	2046.459968058131
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.	2938.9462839522457
They were natural and just.	1397.426423357738
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner."She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	2934.1529075370763
She went on.	1334.6824589420685
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.""You have said quite enough, madam.	2908.9901852047815
I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	2492.7628271330427
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	2128.302613962198
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	2304.2520544034405
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.	2605.1889507461196
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.	3002.5250012544684
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	2650.6701972336386
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	2432.652698983565
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.	2550.685856801409
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.	2725.085699874654
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.	2541.783767693822
But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.	2468.10795239499
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.	2383.093261781584
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"- - And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.	2951.3051275365947
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. - - The envelope itself was likewise full. - - Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	2986.833939753245
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	2836.2029734072653
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	2579.2166932931814
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.	2450.3114045492116
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.	2941.256260524384
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. - - If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.	2872.064404268797
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. - - I will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. - - He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. - - The part which I acted, is now to be explained. - - His sisters'uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. - - We accordingly went - - and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice. - - I described, and enforced them earnestly. - - But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.	3013.767592901614
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. - - But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. - - To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.	2781.1365310377587
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. - - I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.	2889.2855172308828
I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. - - That they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. - - Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. - - It is done, however, and it was done for the best. - - On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.	2879.0137714344946
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.	3023.7071958222978
Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on George Wickham, who was his god - son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.	2696.224330246602
My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; - - most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	2808.840588970228
My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	2814.110075895805
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.	2665.4546973754573
The vicious propensities - - the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	2829.910608079555
My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant.	2957.359694592881
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	1921.0919551888103
His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.	2941.351362555598
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.	2580.5370907521706
I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.	2525.9834437234963
I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.	2105.187694078149
The business was therefore soon settled.	1764.1100389410726
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.	2737.8637443083703
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.	2667.3242304568216
I thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.	2365.7801388991506
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	2840.338963705551
His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.	2683.7748052158427
He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.	2820.209681263933
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	2432.399223027567
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances - - and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	2830.9298505927013
After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	2563.491327082023
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	2297.2394196781574
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.	2568.271053196903
Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.	2965.9284898711667
My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.	2706.6218693834626
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	3022.642175546372
She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.	2507.853008281535
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	2784.227725441761
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.	2177.9768315708943
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.	2893.3677282070967
Younge was of course removed from her charge.	2810.2010342953035
Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement.	2365.666639505984
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.	2848.6934365271336
I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.	2480.5233735271377
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	3116.3362637899195
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.	2332.305087807147
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	2217.6746751097926
If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.	2848.7726558201925
I will only add, God bless you.	1659.2066523799622
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.	2747.9871495199354
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	2654.3611849469507
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	2416.8299897670195
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	2938.215319867307
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.	2725.2163269659927
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.	2690.11355173157
His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.	2832.8492550634196
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	2593.1614781877756
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	2854.2600930231315
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	3183.311443368421
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,"This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"- - and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.	2874.9034127882132
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	2855.1233803486416
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.	2633.101854467994
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.	2977.5564172102477
But when she read, and re - read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	2787.9101036893708
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - - deliberated on the probability of each statement - - but with little success.	2703.759567867672
On both sides it was only assertion.	2457.973447011143
Again she read on.	3304.0338263711733
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	2704.318989111252
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.	2644.996697854254
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the - - - - shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	2416.1750947484825
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.	2713.7091660561605
His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	2632.43345939456
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	2857.000232888514
But no such recollection befriended her.	1696.1512272840855
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.	2702.329489498609
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself - - from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.	2837.7208163446617
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.	2589.9005047566075
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	3183.311443368421
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.	2257.8226124763605
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.	2447.8436320666647
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy - - that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.	2688.8668057246405
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	2963.5422576303895
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust - - any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	2940.438889655168
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - - that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	2948.465829774571
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	2957.792951237601
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. - - Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.	2703.786277733534
But vanity, not love, has been my folly. - - Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.	2849.502108404353
Till this moment, I never knew myself."From herself to Jane - - from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	2871.646005598759
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. - - How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? - - He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; - - and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been. - - Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. - - She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.	3030.919977010556
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.	2722.1910379267515
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	2251.420617717162
It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family; - - and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.	2894.191197828386
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re - considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	2954.362239389824
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. - - Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	2814.8462353657974
She could think only of her letter.	1528.3472889865088
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	2812.338803707462
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.	2949.3949962649863
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. - -"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,"said Lady Catherine;"I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	2680.666331927953
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.	2670.082372739808
Collins so before you came.	2307.329348099017
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.	2181.8541366862887
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.""But my father cannot. - - He wrote last week to hurry my return.""Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. - - Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.	2738.511354852671
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you - - and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.""You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	2922.7712702821123
"Mrs.	994.7808920748562
Collins, you must send a servant with them.	2256.154706142496
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	2534.488412391689
You must contrive to send somebody.	1663.3100411791406
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.	2039.7225446459859
Collins.	1578.7159945142807
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.""My uncle is to send a servant for us.""Oh! - - Your uncle! - - He keeps a man - servant, does he? - - I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.	2667.5330598320475
Where shall you change horses? - - Oh! Bromley, of course. - - If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	3033.399007894344
Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	1615.8534902376016
She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.	2434.124087128892
When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	2813.4773236108313
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	2766.700676293209
They were hopeless of remedy.	1397.426423357738
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	2809.2448649526655
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?	2690.9003228721213
Catherine, weak - spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self - willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.	3070.107933555349
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.	1698.8280829194412
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.	2993.0780682751865
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.	2788.67745757765
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.	2809.7523634713593
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.	2763.447897702844
The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	2889.037866135034
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.	2763.6977693049644
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.	2887.389891967335
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.	2107.5528032420234
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	2658.092471883528
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	3010.203617604485
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.	2463.2202005274453
Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.	2204.8636865233416
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	2988.3256176398345
You see on what a footing we are.	2140.3848625905125
You see how continually we are engaged there.	2140.3848625905125
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.	2954.5219831390164
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	2164.450839701224
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.	2109.1421666346396
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate - - but on this point it will be as well to be silent.	2917.984922055695
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.	2881.5116680214605
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.	2424.985766314769
Poor Charlotte! - - it was melancholy to leave her to such society! - - But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.	3037.2113953499334
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.	2747.6721411024228
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs.	2729.588424680318
Gardiner, though unknown.	1373.1542209764582
He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.	2699.4084399944804
"Good gracious!"cried Maria, after a few minutes silence,"it seems but a day or two since we first came! - - and yet how many things have happened!""A great many indeed,"said her companion with a sigh.	2665.1839339156973
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! - - How much I shall have to tell!"Elizabeth privately added,"And how much I shall have to conceal."Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.	2770.266379176138
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.	2823.6300878678926
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	2447.47041091986
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals.	1996.1336072188947
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.	2941.5102287480004
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch - street, for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs.	2747.8898208424075
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	2066.5639312976946
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern,"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.	2840.269536191829
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the - - - - shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.""Are they indeed?"cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	2795.0301096635303
Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!""Yes,"thought Elizabeth,"_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.	2939.8402119240423
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.""Now I have got some news for you,"said Lydia, as they sat down to table.	2905.5969812275293
"What do you think?	1087.4886873805094
It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.	2536.345893453783
Lydia laughed, and said,"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	2640.5627892599564
You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.	2757.491837510472
I never saw such a long chin in my life.	1901.2435937098576
Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	2665.2646233174073
There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	2727.2646110466476
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.	1977.5744867715848
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	3043.1340897476066
"How nicely we are crammed in!"cried Lydia.	1850.768933634648
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.	2441.2381671643852
Have you seen any pleasant men?	2652.374222606796
Have you had any flirting?	2597.9064969606206
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.	2186.105941604482
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	2614.46587559326
Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.	2475.2748975800077
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady, - - only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col.	2878.0366792024133
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.	2916.4704639279776
Forster.	2243.0040785323354
I thought I should have died.	1285.750487067003
And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.	2925.9214263194485
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."Their party in the dining - room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.	2842.439218699656
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	2834.4296627848794
"Oh! Mary,"said she,"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.	2667.857412017919
And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach.	2686.9368241606585
I was ready to die of laughter.	1511.855678855699
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"To this, Mary very gravely replied,"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.	2865.653068262443
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.	2387.856521197775
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.	1786.5720871636186
I should infinitely prefer a book."But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.	2351.642578074537
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.	2538.6054960494835
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.	2587.5332692013735
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	2685.955622174851
There was another reason too for her opposition.	1988.055957566824
She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	2379.9494481065794
The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	2482.253761045302
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.	2535.2874940343595
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	2823.9290501457663
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.	2810.9741218548816
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	2686.6934102222863
She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	2555.1160046614027
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,"said she;"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.""Indeed,"replied Elizabeth,"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	2672.3955932003614
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?""Blame you! Oh, no.""But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham.""No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.""But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day."She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.	2787.6584514733213
"This will not do,"said Elizabeth.	1435.2673867029146
"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.	2061.673462045896
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.	3166.4292894719256
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.	2683.4076694424493
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	2600.9590834367455
"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief.	2102.405115205792
And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.	2649.1811772670417
Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing.	2850.805370975908
I am sure you must feel it so.""Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.	2127.7580571828726
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.""Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.""There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.	2980.4228349890122
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.""I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do.""And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.	2899.1813207682703
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	2317.551238635719
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.""Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.""Indeed I could not.	2947.3598047629675
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.	1719.354804493822
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.	2396.0810885125084
There is one point, on which I want your advice.	2184.785071767035
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character."Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied,"Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	2731.0647012626564
Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.	1525.3438082654206
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?	2801.1348138855997
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.	2639.6447789851386
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.	2885.2700429784645
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	3072.332156187528
At present I will say nothing about it.""You are quite right.	2053.0305337074674
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.	2599.0986858224514
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re - establish a character.	2274.4185753941974
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.	2547.6946929552637
But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	2322.190506300835
She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.	2286.5361399163426
"And then,"said she,"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	2255.795744202908
Jane was not happy.	1610.229345628037
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.	2101.2136817530495
For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.	2416.8420877287626
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	1938.5609159147693
Well, he is a very undeserving young man - - and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	2679.7525518788407
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know.""I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.""Oh, well! it is just as he chooses.	2644.022728165589
Nobody wants him to come.	3269.0819840970694
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.	2916.305729219764
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.	2763.026232241039
Well, well, I only hope it will last.	2289.241826518617
And what sort of table do they keep?	1982.3914978043613
Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.	2747.702722031942
If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.	2559.0435366443357
There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.""No, nothing at all.""A great deal of good management, depend upon it.	2380.723157447916
Yes, yes.	2541.88126510419
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.	2967.1874776150994
_They_ will never be distressed for money.	2945.451821170591
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	2666.901508422234
They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.""It was a subject which they could not mention before me.""No. It would have been strange if they had.	2770.932954589133
But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.	1937.4442425544294
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	2530.129274467082
_I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."The first week of their return was soon gone.	3038.119137048592
The second began.	1372.8304433889339
The dejection was almost universal.	1727.2645730490492
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	2547.0791973759747
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family.	2898.968377303543
"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!"would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	2474.0774730350267
"I am sure,"said she,"I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.	1466.2899697862338
I thought I should have broke my heart.""I am sure I shall break _mine_,"said Lydia.	2017.4762640287365
Bennet.	450.3779225555953
"Oh, yes! - - if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.""A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever.""And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"added Kitty.	2459.241931989161
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn - house.	2614.654765581867
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.	2576.331624418026
She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.	2299.2034254875834
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.	2396.2052897471726
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	2705.151515416377
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months'acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	2845.6781556182846
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.	1878.3512363489283
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	3090.426595993025
"I cannot see why Mrs.	1056.5648100272592
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"said she,"though I am _not_ her particular friend.	2388.8126634929713
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.	2618.904240806299
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.	2612.751998765995
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.	2837.085487560977
He heard her attentively, and then said,"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.""If you were aware,"said Elizabeth,"of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.""Already arisen!"repeated Mr. Bennet.	2800.4849960481865
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?	1810.3983873460759
Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down.	2949.41007228941
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.	2866.0120674621494
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	1938.6934521164296
Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.	3005.3919861619765
Excuse me - - for I must speak plainly.	3194.196128650943
A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	2953.869918850507
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.	2071.1066674681742
Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	2979.00040916683
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - - or I may say, three very silly sisters.	3101.477905750001
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.	2526.7805632032528
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.	2770.87805676792
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.	2754.1311793058944
The officers will find women better worth their notice.	2051.3110434381892
Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.	2697.950928813812
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	1915.0848410052433
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.	2425.0949191655677
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.	2829.381824821934
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.	2619.2330644655735
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	2370.2288805663993
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.	2339.8828324987194
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.	2789.194536490239
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	2791.0296951383457
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.	2082.411102437196
Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	3012.1751000923164
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	2368.6111580113607
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	2892.4681692535687
Her answer was warmly in his favour.	2134.022760820015
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added,"How long did you say that he was at Rosings?""Nearly three weeks.""And you saw him frequently?""Yes, almost every day.""His manners are very different from his cousin's.""Yes, very different.	2728.7513874767506
But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.""Indeed!"cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.	2340.885803918714
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?	3076.074884831852
for I dare not hope,"he continued in a lower and more serious tone,"that he is improved in essentials.""Oh, no!"said Elizabeth.	2889.2597127370896
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.	2967.9310429762263
His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.	2812.237857881688
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.	2771.708501173555
His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.	2847.6651260532735
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.	2703.622864505596
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.	2106.7580646973456
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	2902.2465076497233
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	2301.634298827991
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	2828.024172299953
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.	2817.71530716727
He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.	2272.215232816847
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	2866.1425587101658
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.	2363.85284287756
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.	2748.5604243858984
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	2830.288466594651
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	2741.6882600791378
Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.	2996.4565961783373
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.	2969.0075055518155
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.	2661.7389712357353
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	2914.403741734831
"But it is fortunate,"thought she,"that I have something to wish for.	1998.221531517376
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.	2680.0493359657585
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.	3016.492380930812
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at Longbourn.	2779.7020987572882
Everything wore a happier aspect.	3269.0819840970694
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	2575.290519866646
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.	2862.4754639595344
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.	2705.014526367258
In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.	2737.5700527749614
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	2260.9144264978054
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.	2834.5882356248126
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	2528.9181285509526
But it was her business to be satisfied - - and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.	2412.4503838404744
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	2531.4731700932557
"But surely,"said she,"I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."The period of expectation was now doubled.	2226.1193897334647
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	2831.5319735786293
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.	2106.9129714593673
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way - - teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	2873.8194189837623
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	2528.240750961089
One enjoyment was certain - - that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences - - cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure - - and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	2989.346036722613
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, & c.	2481.8644578745457
are sufficiently known.	3353.5951024182027
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.	2597.833627688276
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	2772.7754214431843
It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	1954.1786724021392
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.	2420.495774266667
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.	2389.8746038491113
Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	1870.0899652875848
"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.	2314.553323451916
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."Elizabeth was distressed.	2892.572352117408
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	2459.923989038555
She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	2669.890798686222
Gardiner abused her stupidity.	1941.1956057149375
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,"said she,"I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.	2060.3367905115188
The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.	2422.3756253927418
It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.	2683.595005203567
But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	2749.387303716467
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.	3097.6055261089073
A most welcome negative followed the last question - - and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.	2954.6828524091898
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	2522.113051154719
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	2593.484070568217
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	2235.956913433268
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.	2433.93367332541
They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.	2887.6458026891123
Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	2938.9462839522457
Elizabeth was delighted.	1124.7679771199328
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.	2792.532689390055
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.	1942.8703385159558
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.	2814.7767674385314
The housekeeper came; a respectable - looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	2586.0466846716367
It was a large, well - proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.	1741.2237578972274
The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.	2627.7240845690094
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	2971.552308126799
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.	2638.444430925651
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.	2847.0766792477366
"And of this place,"thought she,"I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. - - But no,"- - recollecting herself, - -"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."This was a lucky recollection - - it saved her from something like regret.	2831.4037379801957
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.	2409.9130753154855
At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.	2518.922668271205
Reynolds replied, that he was, adding,"but we expect him to - morrow, with a large party of friends."How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	3016.0995173678975
She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle - piece.	2596.9500653589453
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	2461.53011398061
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence. - -"He is now gone into the army,"she added,"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."Mrs.	2602.6367514164895
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.	2372.419830385625
"And that,"said Mrs.	918.7714510057028
It was drawn at the same time as the other - - about eight years ago.""I have heard much of your master's fine person,"said Mrs.	2141.652652227194
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."Mrs.	1802.5490024396456
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"Elizabeth coloured, and said - -"A little.""And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?""Yes, very handsome.""I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	2591.5447994910814
This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.	2803.985503585754
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.	2932.9535718951975
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?"said Mr. Gardiner.	2041.5883682685217
"Oh! yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished! - - She plays and sings all day long.	2271.1892035693877
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - - a present from my master; she comes here to - morrow with him."Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.	2794.1082700887896
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.	2938.8957362188667
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?""Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.""Except,"thought Elizabeth,"when she goes to Ramsgate.""If your master would marry, you might see more of him.""Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.	2710.854219515938
Gardiner smiled.	1544.3547255008566
Elizabeth could not help saying,"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.""I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him,"replied the other.	2648.598242843381
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.	2894.096390283506
That he was not a good - tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.	2494.81650798137
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.	2832.856339952396
But I have always observed, that they who are good - natured when children, are good - natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest - tempered, most generous - hearted, boy in the world."Elizabeth almost stared at her. - -"Can this be Mr. Darcy!"thought she.	2700.9245515550256
"His father was an excellent man,"said Mrs.	1506.5654081228329
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him - - just as affable to the poor."Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	2626.856349777755
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.	2792.213754920433
She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.	2596.8992821817183
"He is the best landlord, and the best master,"said she,"that ever lived.	1764.405332374376
Not like the wild young men now - a - days, who think of nothing but themselves.	2880.2268283456006
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.	2380.4653866250624
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.	3140.278543941603
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.""In what an amiable light does this place him!"thought Elizabeth.	2884.1340864281938
"This fine account of him,"whispered her aunt, as they walked,"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.""Perhaps we might be deceived.""That is not very likely; our authority was too good."On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.	2842.117300294857
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.	2819.9613084336097
"And this is always the way with him,"she added. - -"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	2459.366595486927
There is nothing he would not do for her."The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed - rooms, were all that remained to be shewn.	2620.466106292636
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.	2787.784040620715
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.	2507.680249150801
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.	2494.6902345271697
At last it arrested her - - and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.	2740.9128697403808
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.	2559.5434716701916
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.	2911.2945987388734
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.	2699.8907648850527
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.	2727.4536797665637
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?	2707.013522014939
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship! - - How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! - - How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.	2942.597941268307
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	2873.441239268624
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	2890.032227584466
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	2443.8122889899455
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.	2745.651937515602
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.	2803.695486749157
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.	2333.839685927331
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	2914.3373582427853
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.	3090.3156738938346
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.	3044.6313118839084
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.	2679.8204154077835
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.	2743.0517345560093
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.	1340.311773468548
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	3017.0800406679796
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	2882.3643531280145
That he should even speak to her was amazing! - - but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	2889.228587964689
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.	2856.38287695872
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.	2824.4972685453113
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was.	2747.6721411024228
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.	2660.5152725642056
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease.	2932.6352869884795
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.	3071.498386999826
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	2923.7004464950815
Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.	2127.64099482679
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.	2614.0600306019332
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it.	2912.618449394639
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.	2658.40530887509
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.	2554.8980639199835
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	2603.8042589314114
For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	2894.0325274323773
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.	2823.373101348371
Her colour changed, and she said no more.	2365.082992446343
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	2734.7182112792257
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.	2880.8802462107997
"What will be his surprise,"thought she,"when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion."The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.	2787.623319491584
That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.	2717.0023278275175
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.	2184.739636829853
It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	2220.424484077806
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.	2740.8458496657254
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.	2313.6151876154045
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.	2521.9561411788104
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.	2350.2932429831344
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.	2536.30822831811
It is impossible that he should still love me."After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	2761.9784064132273
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.	2533.9913865134076
Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.	1725.4216079250168
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.	2169.340334457306
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected - -"for your housekeeper,"she added,"informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country."He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	2846.1216482614127
"They will join me early to - morrow,"he continued,"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you, - - Mr. Bingley and his sisters."Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	2601.865859672438
"There is also one other person in the party,"he continued after a pause,"who more particularly wishes to be known to you, - - Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	2831.916736114129
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	2468.8931853036493
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.	2624.730916353529
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.	2102.9856048400316
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.	2303.352375467444
He then asked her to walk into the house - - but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	2591.1411605520534
At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.	2488.768049008375
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.	2201.9076810277857
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.	2744.3078058202545
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly - - and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over.	2972.556572140875
On Mr. and Mrs.	1324.0229622740248
Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.	2082.4197239997393
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	2592.1302928322452
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure,"replied her aunt,"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	2534.5506358158104
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.	2186.4994474933974
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.""To be sure, Lizzy,"said her aunt,"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.	2773.5820983318717
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.	2763.445050095584
Gardiner,"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.	2531.3494940073333
He has not an ill - natured look.	1758.3874181067858
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.	2403.481819871663
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	2686.9368241606585
But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	2598.1260733621134
But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.	2903.0349807460993
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	3069.742941450205
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	2663.98166705545
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.	2495.9494856729993
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.	2795.235983425335
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.	2740.236572657245
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.	2878.2198850122263
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	2990.2115696270184
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	2691.886439169319
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.	2463.603299497745
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	2802.766423941527
Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.	3035.3444675164837
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.	2364.8104248817417
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.	2784.486836679548
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.	2405.5909480370574
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.	2472.2306381144717
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	2800.766595185493
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.	2980.65811427194
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done.	2718.4931737021593
To Mr. and Mrs.	1152.6468638372958
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.	2407.086373038341
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	2094.3743584377085
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.	2817.0312521386395
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.	3012.1939856171266
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	1967.9002091651157
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	2834.3533802151296
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner.	2827.944557949431
But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.	2443.0394396574675
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	2868.110223404656
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it"was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;"and, before she could reply, he added,"It is above eight months.	2884.8574175938957
We have not met since the <NUM> th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.	2881.97812651409
There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.	2627.0697290327316
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	2768.241135348391
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.	2923.4205907671135
Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self - consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.	3035.6215801823314
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.	2294.1149408786596
Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.	2593.316289677571
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.	2697.4324549023568
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	2941.3549610445707
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.	2825.8807405594425
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	3031.39956825676
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	2362.7054008338837
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	2314.587684471976
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	2984.431671614434
They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy.	2768.40868036161
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	3073.04694363853
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town, where the family did not visit.	2738.593801112969
It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	2220.5396149502894
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.	2969.0915056604686
She certainly did not hate him.	1823.3871358426413
It was gratitude. - - Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	2644.9552226749383
He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	2890.6168026303485
She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	2885.895582564524
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.	2851.0186880559827
They were, therefore, to go. - - Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	2502.1915088241035
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	2656.9454207775816
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.	3022.1295083521377
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	2832.129442669028
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	3029.433487028208
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs.	2520.4026059461808
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.	2080.6951456747097
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	3069.5900889126005
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	2474.1465475691525
By Mrs.	2355.2149120418076
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.	2593.263272882698
It was first broken by Mrs.	1261.6306040663444
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	2164.6181444429785
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	2784.446792958049
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.	2618.3263242267476
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.	2877.1053593597494
Her own thoughts were employing her.	2145.419699333378
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	2262.2637857914306
She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	2622.5876411191125
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.	2762.8871378754143
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.	3074.9703859114693
There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.	2766.202523602025
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.	2946.1943385627146
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.	2727.1997080887054
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; - - a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.	2953.2711420801584
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.	2897.469321039093
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	2825.836599271444
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the - - - - shire militia removed from Meryton?	2589.428193998073
While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	2965.606544957959
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.	3004.516163113915
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.	2641.870866079492
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.	2749.114022239592
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	2861.2208498100886
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	2939.7925739659213
But Georgiana would not join her.	1849.5906571441847
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.	2852.412976047311
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.	2734.9636091541715
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"she cried;"I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	2397.548749382395
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, - - no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.	2728.772895759377
"For my own part,"she rejoined,"I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.	2479.7209961280496
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	2693.271159358626
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	2500.501950862003
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self - sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.	2924.5958269820508
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield,'_She_ a beauty! - - I should as soon call her mother a wit.'But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.""Yes,"replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,"but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	2894.693281566415
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.	2660.1891073042752
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	2611.543311661256
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.	1913.2676307616769
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.	2583.581090960671
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.	2860.486289632295
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	2283.417591483665
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.	2582.762320221253
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.	2453.2756880440675
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.	2804.950712194435
It was to this effect:"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you - - be assured that we are all well.	2562.016993352833
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! - - Imagine our surprise.	3028.8256751879053
To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.	2630.043298443453
I am very, very sorry.	1224.8535126696493
So imprudent a match on both sides! - - But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.	2996.5878992313183
His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.	2646.2858569429663
My father bears it better.	1720.8474483127657
How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.	2847.895493299451
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.	2414.426819482362
The express was sent off directly.	1855.8252475284564
My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.	2452.721881677612
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.	2520.570155747361
Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.	2749.592560095682
I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.	2075.646320809457
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	2706.879776580731
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	3071.960181770477
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.	2966.8281688196
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.	2726.414377016723
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs.	2759.564075259336
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F.	3132.933101807515
who instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.	3077.589974056414
intending to trace their route.	3269.0819840970694
All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.	2870.742607269727
I know not what to think.	1315.5769772300732
After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.	2630.012675060563
came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through.	3103.329836618605
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.	2786.418053649451
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs.	1471.6687798641958
F.	3559.386868537643
but no one can throw any blame on them.	3194.1014661681547
Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.	2742.156117686908
My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.	2341.854395679555
I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F.	2133.928875683914
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.	3071.902404550728
was not a man to be trusted.	3223.17075781386
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room.	2375.645863919769
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder.	3005.0753573369934
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	2540.695818061415
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	1876.2676278009649
I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible.	2693.8560903761186
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.	2381.748100673159
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.	2449.7049831010477
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""Oh! where, where is my uncle?"cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.	2843.8731211979584
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed,"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	2777.6659208238234
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.""Good God! what is the matter?"cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself,"I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs.	2659.3368143877424
Gardiner.	937.6791275413445
You are not well enough; - - you cannot go yourself."Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	2727.3500723343573
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.	3107.6023475081224
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,"Let me call your maid.	2886.981281530331
Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief? - - A glass of wine; - - shall I get you one? - - You are very ill.""No, I thank you;"she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	2886.233219196176
"There is nothing the matter with me.	1507.101461067995
I am quite well.	902.002228855213
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.	2514.4497250497902
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.	2815.0266752381385
At length, she spoke again.	1787.3543463392364
"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.	1693.2352461292357
It cannot be concealed from any one.	1697.6309260332803
My youngest sister has left all her friends - - has eloped; - - has thrown herself into the power of - - of Mr. Wickham.	2722.451448116784
They are gone off together from Brighton.	1751.0092677990215
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	2938.9462839522457
She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to - - she is lost for ever."Darcy was fixed in astonishment.	2549.4612836257584
"When I consider,"she added, in a yet more agitated voice,"that _I_ might have prevented it! - - _I_ who knew what he was.	2481.115995185668
But it is all, all too late now.""I am grieved, indeed,"cried Darcy;"grieved - - shocked.	2266.975442060532
But is it certain, absolutely certain?""Oh yes! - - They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.""And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?""My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.	2819.5604430411076
How is such a man to be worked on?	2591.562815940734
I have not the smallest hope.	1066.6836837853298
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character. - - Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not - - I was afraid of doing too much.	2669.299545139847
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.	2595.8331025070584
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	2054.812090938938
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	2747.654914047785
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	2522.5278345201873
It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.	2485.3739302249724
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	2297.2394196781574
Lydia - - the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	3000.7841783515646
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress. - - But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	3069.828080028299
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day.""Oh, yes.	2746.515714194324
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.	2982.3665255409705
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.	3207.097781346334
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible. - - I know it cannot be long."He readily assured her of his secrecy - - again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.	3085.9474906306928
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	2935.4551460767607
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	2764.5276916755097
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.	2895.380458304385
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.	2914.0090540613423
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.	2715.8588705186485
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.	3183.311443368421
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise - - all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.	2995.075130825162
But now it was all too natural.	1731.7691016179824
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.	3132.933101807515
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl. - - Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.	2540.2298722343144
Mr. and Mrs.	434.60244753918306
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; - - but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy. - - Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs.	2784.577754860407
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.	2260.996322917059
They were to be off as soon as possible.	1683.1638819883324
Gardiner.	937.6791275413445
"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; - - was it so?""Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	2624.9357715135193
_That_ is all settled.""That is all settled;"repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.	2918.3908554788122
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.	2699.135246323695
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.	2930.9327441298105
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.	2987.5443675463557
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"said her uncle, as they drove from the town;"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.	2531.290334283664
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.	2855.6611921923995
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?	2742.0071562715757
His temptation is not adequate to the risk.""Do you really think so?"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	2620.1145177703524
"Upon my word,"said Mrs.	1182.8205113252975
Gardiner,"I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.	1929.3284194503024
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?""Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	2893.3088295538964
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.	2066.3995850560295
If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it.	2586.4454756596915
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?""In the first place,"replied Mr. Gardiner,"there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.""Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.""Well, then - - supposing them to be in London.	2758.4529598537943
They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	2529.717707601246
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.""But why all this secrecy?	2573.1033679591387
Why any fear of detection?	2563.0122216516675
His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.	2683.2661207486703
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	2714.2679668189653
He cannot afford it.	1506.56385257825
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	2793.207388009295
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	2840.631607155259
But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.	2321.0053667860266
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?""It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes,"that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.	2965.107713814759
But, really, I know not what to say.	1754.9343004995635
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.	2641.5654507763147
But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.	2654.3620549892285
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	2463.3669241040707
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater - - what shall I call it?	2498.1207015724162
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	3183.311443368421
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.""But you see that Jane,"said her aunt,"does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.""Of whom does Jane ever think ill?	2765.3518433376726
And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?	2771.2049715069516
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.	2281.112199747728
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.	2658.1195534103294
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	2172.126824417244
That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.""And do you really know all this?"cried Mrs.	2492.641598554012
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	2269.0563340756235
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	2620.3850211033523
From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.	2797.445904706876
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?""Oh, yes! - - that, that is the worst of all.	2671.248339070744
Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.	2884.7138426544075
As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	2942.1966678525555
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.	2540.471702287375
Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	2685.2480372794894
That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	2731.601399404904
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	2644.3730825705147
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.	2650.7794863356185
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	2694.7484554878365
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	3127.1439546194424
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner - time the next day.	2664.3816251020125
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	2820.058442580753
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	2823.453480682337
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.	2578.0949741419013
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well.""Is my father in town?""Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word.""And have you heard from him often?""We have heard only once.	2638.624954838042
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.	2737.8637443083703
He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention.""And my mother - - How is she?	2552.1661205274727
How are you all?""My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.	2839.2102606674
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.	2094.2607469372665
She does not yet leave her dressing - room.	2101.2759597730496
Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well.""But you - - How are you?"cried Elizabeth.	2620.123159435788
"You look pale.	995.3349944342757
How much you must have gone through!"Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.	2636.9741854353547
Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.	2582.0341467197327
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	2628.4801729418577
When they were all in the drawing - room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.	2605.8791236194925
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	2868.293242114573
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	2792.337756628221
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?	2803.7044216189483
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.	2431.2657712818823
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over - ruled, as I always am.	2523.249641949841
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.	2884.6807320471294
"Do not give way to useless alarm,"added he,"though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	2563.520031301267
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.	1594.275605726864
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.	2728.0613012583362
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.""Oh! my dear brother,"replied Mrs.	2517.4490558893767
Bennet,"that is exactly what I could most wish for.	1734.131804757596
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.	2803.010913082521
And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.	2467.864150239307
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, - - that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	3035.9624605088957
Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	2972.5942943993464
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.	2989.3913103438113
In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.	2653.943380430893
One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.	2803.7370674365243
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.	2854.6193451184963
As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	2841.8260109180824
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable - - that one false step involves her in endless ruin - - that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful, - - and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.	2939.4147969184487
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	2932.9308049355363
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.	2720.4651933914843
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying,"But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard.	2958.9725143072333
Give me farther particulars.	3304.0338263711733
What did Colonel Forster say?	2389.2801461922904
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?	2557.0551196026286
They must have seen them together for ever.""Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	2743.2340601330175
I am so grieved for him.	1164.3447627658427
He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.""And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?	2851.8811395466487
Did he know of their intending to go off?	2890.6784587317093
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?""Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	2808.404654667646
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying - - and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.""And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?""How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy - - a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.	2881.2980766157366
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.	2433.844277507027
Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	2965.6065449579646
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.""But not before they went to Brighton?""No, I believe not.""And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?	2633.948783404732
Does he know his real character?""I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.	2994.3000665160234
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	2084.9092787405593
"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	2324.709021031006
We acted with the best intentions.""Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?""He brought it with him for us to see."Jane then took it from her pocket - book, and gave it to Elizabeth.	2939.7561857712135
These were the contents:"MY DEAR HARRIET,"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.	3006.871927390997
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia Wickham.	2728.1560687244814
What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing.	2633.0725041699816
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	3007.077305965365
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up.	2563.9358714212117
Good bye.	2128.090397260505
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	1998.4824242726172
But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	2395.133378148295
My poor father! how he must have felt it!""I never saw any one so shocked.	2668.3177581256023
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.	1925.5030715991006
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!""Oh! Jane,"cried Elizabeth,"was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?""I do not know. - - I hope there was. - - But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	2671.7326888060547
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties.""Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	2894.8181703497007
Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.""Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	2748.399177268557
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us.""She had better have stayed at home,"cried Elizabeth;"perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.	2825.989145648832
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	2959.645547710634
"He meant, I believe,"replied Jane,"to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.	2522.995096024148
His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.	2683.7539724985068
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	2734.9995988722358
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	2808.3146365638245
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	2717.5458573126693
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	2467.1364281072943
Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	1750.639764256371
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	2855.43142670601
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.	2712.695753808292
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.	1931.8422143922587
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	1989.9051583737587
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.	2922.351559857566
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	2586.93620439182
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.	2823.9463914523244
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.	2554.5190198629975
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.	2983.3976038864084
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	2358.152162297524
He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.	2644.0141651983254
There was also a postscript to this effect.	1833.2618948766776
At present we have nothing to guide us.	2216.009681892828
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	2643.56337296705
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	2242.7572387648383
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the - - - - shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.	2373.2457392375104
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.	2858.7009117120474
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	2421.242144080691
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	3111.527303693427
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	2869.0882146558283
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.	2967.231449628379
Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	2833.3720600648885
No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	2948.032954489697
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	2385.777021448644
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.	2837.826301111446
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.	2441.2054619664614
Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs.	3124.6145677204795
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.	2538.600098207991
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family.	2848.3688501799825
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.	2861.341536824028
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.	2820.12661667022
"I am, dear Sir, & c.	1145.2216029089068
& c."Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	2864.8147479448903
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	2343.651822952494
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.	2790.828317805124
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.	2413.938217697776
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.	2918.168678234396
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	2671.7193793099013
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	2528.6977917061167
Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.	2054.399839053681
"This is wholly unexpected.	1220.7746303755648
Rendered spiritless by the ill - success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother - in - law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.	3030.3133117448915
When Mrs.	1521.7661859564578
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.	2544.83692855225
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!"she cried.	2003.6164898264292
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"As Mrs.	2956.7879457262525
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.	2780.405279523414
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.	2575.308772299617
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	2717.1500098477222
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs.	2728.8906602791353
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	2582.7963866797936
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better.	2907.07173245321
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.	2310.8589664864903
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.	2318.023550454932
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.	2751.462489760979
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied,"Say nothing of that.	2563.4912887458577
Who should suffer but myself?	2733.7094720664936
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.""You must not be too severe upon yourself,"replied Elizabeth.	2350.59162566246
"You may well warn me against such an evil.	1565.0747359572945
Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.	3113.0226288455765
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	1359.7128930103129
It will pass away soon enough.""Do you suppose them to be in London?""Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?""And Lydia used to want to go to London,"added Kitty.	2603.961233694693
"She is happy, then,"said her father, drily;"and her residence there will probably be of some duration."Then, after a short silence, he continued,"Lizzy, I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.	2793.8327297559854
"This is a parade,"cried he,"which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can, - - or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away.""I am not going to run away, Papa,"said Kitty, fretfully;"if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.""_You_ go to Brighton! - - I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.	2884.9428701769307
No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.	2870.7426072697244
Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	3074.500966833807
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	2874.758532850252
"Well, well,"said he,"do not make yourself unhappy.	1564.7292291792446
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet,"I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.""What do you mean, Hill?	2859.8305563669305
We have heard nothing from town.""Dear madam,"cried Mrs.	2325.063045801339
Hill, in great astonishment,"don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?	3036.969576443223
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	2559.562836888582
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library; - - their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	2968.4750594498582
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,"Oh, Papa, what news?	2895.083587942635
what news?	3098.8797460633723
have you heard from my uncle?""Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.""Well, and what news does it bring?	2831.590649542323
good or bad?""What is there of good to be expected?"said he, taking the letter from his pocket;"but perhaps you would like to read it."Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	3050.8692494436827
Jane now came up.	2170.186444386352
"Read it aloud,"said their father,"for I hardly know myself what it is about.""Gracechurch - street, Monday, August <NUM>.	2643.0966311169605
Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.	3124.6145677204795
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	2051.9432179945543
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both - - - -""Then it is, as I always hoped,"cried Jane;"they are married!"Elizabeth read on;"I have seen them both.	2575.4281997471685
They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.	2784.4921244713114
These are conditions, which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.	3019.4772892075935
I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	2201.7678892766303
You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.	2409.8469294142515
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	2754.99603622344
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.	2862.5880320374977
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.	2825.077107561511
Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.	2958.037032191657
We have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.	2698.0832923092185
Your's, & c.	1124.7231769734358
"EDW.	994.7808920748562
GARDINER.""Is it possible!"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	2635.8124401671116
"Can it be possible that he will marry her?""Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;"said her sister.	2675.7854337206995
"My dear father, I congratulate you.""And have you answered the letter?"said Elizabeth.	1886.8150129720943
"No; but it must be done soon."Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.	2573.814220480517
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case.""Let me write for you,"said Jane,"if you dislike the trouble yourself.""I dislike it very much,"he replied;"but it must be done."And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	2849.256677817704
"And may I ask?"said Elizabeth,"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.""Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.""And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!""Yes, yes, they must marry.	2605.1958400953718
There is nothing else to be done.	1739.8968047485455
But there are two things that I want very much to know: - - one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him.""Money! my uncle!"cried Jane,"what do you mean, Sir?""I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.""That is very true,"said Elizabeth;"though it had not occurred to me before.	2831.2313559696595
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.	2760.1662142778296
Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast - room.	2789.496783598342
"And they are really to be married!"cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.	1964.0518306715364
"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.	2140.3512677122894
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!""I comfort myself with thinking,"replied Jane,"that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	2835.894529013993
He has children of his own, and may have more.	1999.305320646375
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?""If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"said Elizabeth,"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.	2784.7557949892325
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	2876.0945118232644
By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!""We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"said Jane:"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.	3021.7652548867045
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.	2697.615731955288
It is useless to talk of it."It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	2461.4532250084985
They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.	2678.3373579410854
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.	2525.245154778602
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet could hardly contain herself.	1570.5341529176817
As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.	2619.5102864677615
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	2257.8226124763605
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.	2396.0457627832684
"My dear, dear Lydia!"she cried:"This is delightful indeed! - - She will be married! - - I shall see her again! - - She will be married at sixteen! - - My good, kind brother! - - I knew how it would be - - I knew he would manage every thing.	2500.17509667398
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.	2894.0036451535916
Stay, stay, I will go myself.	3207.097781346334
My dear, dear Lydia! - - How merry we shall be together when we meet!"Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	2791.7532358875487
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,"she added,"in a great measure, to his kindness.	2161.3074396877837
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.""Well,"cried her mother,"it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?	2652.150739392037
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	2770.859302458368
Well! I am so happy.	2521.7552252214255
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.	2195.9104473530642
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Wickham! How well it sounds.	2727.4536797665637
And she was only sixteen last June.	2287.9092061017914
Other schemes too came into her head.	3223.054000588838
"I will go to Meryton,"said she,"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.	2006.1275929614303
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.	2490.6693018469477
Long.	1539.6758731008151
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.	2717.30718246779
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.	2567.681262556869
Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?	3174.2098987362506
Oh! here comes Hill.	2011.825994232193
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."Mrs.	2673.859654978804
Hill began instantly to express her joy.	2984.25228923396
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	2660.324518101929
Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.	2607.5651682396824
He now wished it more than ever.	1909.3972264098163
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	2899.5300810384183
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	2682.50414544724
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	2639.732059561915
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	2745.837387436853
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.	2809.882545635505
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.	2877.73073254449
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.	2206.492143189887
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.	2754.220950367242
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.	2419.183842426221
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.	3077.589974056414
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.	2383.166131822821
This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	2816.648560196034
He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.	2504.8386192566454
He would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.	2887.581652322908
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.	2902.6830523717767
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	2595.525393878223
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.	2660.5322607084736
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.	2453.2756880440675
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.	1607.4792229118866
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.	2795.697652113914
It was a fortnight since Mrs.	1061.0303124566587
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.	2552.2509862002235
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	2452.8605632870044
Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	3166.466158791014
I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs.	2505.556704572499
Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.	2641.236449356059
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.	2347.991593064427
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet could hardly comprehend it.	1570.5341529176817
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.	2928.162646551888
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.	2622.5593564659466
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.	2832.0060219717816
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	1882.9841133436773
Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.	2941.217257764172
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	2860.343302230276
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	2770.5126280865666
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.	2694.1059963581947
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.	2116.8241157006046
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.	2491.0552496596274
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.	2257.8386148479694
But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.	2246.7630943543536
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.	2555.1375729233773
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	2509.10647956907
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.	2654.5940676799355
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	2988.1503972025025
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.	2767.329200697734
* * * * * Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	2442.3092254832945
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.	2455.3976084797873
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,"he added,"as soon as his marriage was fixed on.	2274.7497401937117
And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.	2780.256680212393
It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	2471.3253085789333
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General - - - -'s regiment, now quartered in the North.	2432.7995934707506
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.	2080.272499424818
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.	2684.8274323535197
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information.	2816.8599568166046
He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.	2288.508721121176
Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.	3159.7015234210685
They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.	2597.0346805400877
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South.	2410.0107391864603
She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother. - - Your's, & c.	2079.554483630351
"E.	994.7808920748562
GARDINER."Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the - - - - shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.	2566.2836787489505
But Mrs.	823.0086948142413
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.	2922.1857692814488
"She is so fond of Mrs.	1486.6630089576938
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	2704.834100187404
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.	2788.868946723512
When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.	2668.2678065970695
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.	2822.705080432725
The carriage was sent to meet them at - - - -, and they were to return in it, by dinner - time.	2643.1621232339453
They came.	1359.6300184719883
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.	2301.6610986335863
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.	2325.538562965892
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.	2440.073402868845
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	2795.1646485711553
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.	2776.7748823589654
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.	2476.3661148007145
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.	2421.2885789570537
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.	2019.2616428555064
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.	2656.8065492329756
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.	2802.0584361934416
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	3011.077991575241
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.	2661.7113948283604
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	3072.078632091592
There was no want of discourse.	1635.860475023494
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.	2830.1242617356925
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.	2322.693160986547
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.	2969.318883361271
"Only think of its being three months,"she cried,"since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.	2647.1562023175625
Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."Her father lifted up his eyes.	2955.246744253508
Jane was distressed.	1535.0644782987376
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,"Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to - day?	2853.988344331017
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing."Elizabeth could bear it no longer.	2835.233269792793
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour.	2647.177875874435
Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called"Mrs.	2622.2595884948014
Hill and the two housemaids.	2961.02280857848
"Well, mamma,"said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room,"and what do you think of my husband?	2144.5837320993714
Is not he a charming man?	2636.3008939798992
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.	1404.0182731573643
They must all go to Brighton.	1845.279446248357
That is the place to get husbands.	2496.306260244279
But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.	2455.073910305224
Must it be so?""Oh, lord! yes; - - there is nothing in that.	2893.9609362319293
I shall like it of all things.	1536.030911558227
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.""I should like it beyond any thing!"said her mother.	2778.451101733808
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.""I thank you for my share of the favour,"said Elizabeth;"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	2767.3951892554414
Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	2129.6760317348517
No one but Mrs.	2173.1181517584723
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.	3017.7839288766054
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.	2962.2261243577022
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	2260.538249825888
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.	2544.7859775000866
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.	2757.0635193742155
You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.	2592.722016534867
We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.	2798.67931888452
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.	2564.4569187627917
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.	2699.3105273507217
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.	2851.0068533760405
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.	2636.65032862493
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.	2671.5500026642094
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	2762.073948216504
To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.	2426.312923733984
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.	2717.3958378712523
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.	2781.0814696521857
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	2272.729816358667
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.""Mr. Darcy!"repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	2705.838632288185
"Oh, yes! - - he was to come there with Wickham, you know.	1802.6010126207927
But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.	2405.8419160395856
I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?	2133.8129548348115
You may depend upon my seeking no further.""Oh! certainly,"said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;"we will ask you no questions.""Thank you,"said Lydia,"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.	2675.164693604228
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.	2496.673244982335
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	2333.550496301559
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.	3122.391124869481
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	2995.895121802029
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.	2604.455221401805
"You may readily comprehend,"she added,"what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.	2422.273286568859
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it - - unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.""Not that I _shall_ though,"she added to herself, as she finished the letter;"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it; - - till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	3021.3214048977898
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.	2147.752962587993
She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.	2710.456302544381
"Gracechurch - street, Sept.	1660.4880129797637
"MY DEAR NIECE,"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.	2721.042467584668
I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.	2215.2425796250245
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know, that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side.	3108.8717910041446
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.	2373.2960253427673
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am - - and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done.	2901.0055969835794
But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.	2147.3917688947304
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	2575.274517490245
It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been.	2297.4270993944756
He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.	2749.3391930234675
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.	2843.746897139069
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.	2805.0015156591
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	2718.4931737021593
He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself.	2672.0656749963523
There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs.	2004.800038115821
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.	2984.3708622642525
She then took a large house in Edward - street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	2467.7597786267493
This Mrs.	1790.8862637667478
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	2889.6610141661076
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.	2168.296805448093
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.	2584.0128868657857
They were in - - - - street.	1769.672193576741
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.	2223.407321866859
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	2899.937033328365
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	1924.2969967753531
She cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving Wickham.	2493.3081490158797
She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.	2192.961377738395
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	2814.9844232977166
He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	2524.6488520699327
Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.	1707.1765155107998
But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	2579.464323217566
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.	3073.1185041516487
They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.	2361.5656304903655
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	2926.3833628458506
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch - street the evening before I came home.	2735.694866906453
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	2605.285775718402
He did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.	2485.3085763147515
On Saturday he came again.	2307.329348099017
Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.	2811.1730016302904
They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.	2361.5656304903655
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	2109.4008240936428
But our visitor was very obstinate.	1849.5906571441847
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all.	2354.5524703992296
He has been accused of many faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	2240.2079641733076
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	3003.7535748501327
They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.	2678.147879966822
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.	1977.1226537103032
You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.	2378.5805955796745
His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased.	2751.3815538185986
It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.	2567.830263569372
Perhaps there was some truth in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve, can be answerable for the event.	2969.318883361271
But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair.	2659.409429970832
I believe I have now told you every thing.	1917.9428415015811
Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.	2729.639632610026
_He_ was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no fresh pain.	3026.303003637348
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	2708.333721154554
If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.	2671.8828267607287
I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	2400.9002870088893
Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.	2899.593784729074
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.	2739.4713713063643
But slyness seems the fashion.	1720.674584715767
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.	2026.6836928213818
A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	2761.6929527664242
But I must write no more.	1363.5589824911458
The children have been wanting me this half hour.	2051.3110434381892
Your's, very sincerely,"M.	2126.951345028349
GARDINER."The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.	2919.030241165029
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	2958.3869637080597
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	2171.1497468840207
Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	2379.9372178533
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	2748.9062563221487
Brother - in - law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.	3140.197665320608
She was ashamed to think how much.	1402.0759115700694
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.	2308.163177643086
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him.	2502.5946864207676
Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.	2749.396333196405
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	2742.3701583060415
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.	3072.840125708834
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.	2262.239200777727
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	1607.4792229118866
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.	2493.0389471976005
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"said he, as he joined her.	1900.2237168663771
"You certainly do,"she replied with a smile;"but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.""I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	2485.3065803624236
_We_ were always good friends; and now we are better.""True.	3002.12530962255
Are the others coming out?""I do not know.	2180.3223837731475
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.	2075.6985219343455
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."She replied in the affirmative.	2620.994021904
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?	2325.8292758160733
But of course she did not mention my name to you.""Yes, she did.""And what did she say?""That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had - - not turned out well.	2596.7425718460468
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.""Certainly,"he replied, biting his lips.	2515.6471470195515
We passed each other several times.	2303.702507037465
I wonder what he can be doing there.""Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,"said Elizabeth.	2266.3910198255626
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.""Undoubtedly.	2216.997023421537
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?	2616.040320433778
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.""Yes; he introduced us to his sister.""And do you like her?""Very much.""I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.	2550.1098996147634
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	2396.288189241976
A most delightful place! - - Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.""How should you have liked making sermons?""Exceedingly well.	2869.4718423254603
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?""I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.""You have.	2937.1514363201136
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember.""I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.""You did! and it was not wholly without foundation.	3034.3027058492185
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	2838.92383850316
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.	2529.481410249676
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.	2079.8167767590126
"Oh! my dear Lydia,"she cried,"when shall we meet again?""Oh, lord! I don't know.	2045.132994478528
But you know married women have never much time for writing.	2093.9070566934106
They will have nothing else to do."Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	2266.470882816003
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	2279.1073466864136
"He is as fine a fellow,"said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house,"as ever I saw.	1938.3931744251154
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.	2327.959516261726
I am prodigiously proud of him.	1164.3447627658438
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son - in - law."The loss of her daughter made Mrs.	2541.525207840437
Bennet very dull for several days.	1958.8189368357964
One seems so forlorn without them.""This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,"said Elizabeth.	2519.2298684954776
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.""It is no such thing.	2080.252292690633
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	2867.6947273991636
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	2933.531830964027
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.	2638.503024809231
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.	1523.0935050450084
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	1982.1358241491116
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"(for Mrs.	2164.809990710048
Not that I care about it, though.	2354.842815447308
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.	2305.726319311605
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	2110.189147241321
And who knows what _may_ happen?	2096.654420496435
But that is nothing to us.	1512.7162186939368
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?""You may depend on it,"replied the other,"for Mrs.	2570.6069003941934
Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	3070.4982169601776
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	2371.144277530981
She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed."Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour.	2704.4813618443936
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,"I saw you look at me to - day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.	2540.742996454211
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.	2246.7349214230394
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.	2193.796588735886
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.	2026.1618048672854
I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	2128.5508066103844
Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	2761.144571990488
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.	2949.2654269260406
"Yet it is hard,"she sometimes thought,"that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	2865.0211907438184
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"said Mrs.	1611.070691007928
Bennet,"you will wait on him of course.""No, no.	1841.4535866300216
But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.	2725.514451634704
"'Tis an etiquette I despise,"said he.	1950.1065571891506
"If he wants our society, let him seek it.	1889.8910094299947
I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again.""Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.	2565.1565900310848
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.	2103.9247983432747
We must have Mrs.	1797.6673269361165
Long and the Gouldings soon.	2563.0122216516675
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did.	2978.1671002979383
As the day of his arrival drew near,"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,"said Jane to her sister.	2706.6392066400886
My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says.	2682.0970826250186
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!""I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,"replied Elizabeth;"but it is wholly out of my power.	3010.304519471052
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."Mr. Bingley arrived.	2612.1399110168804
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	2589.889497472472
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing - room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	2578.722564448654
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	2416.8299897670195
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window - - she looked, - - she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.	2814.5868312272896
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,"said Kitty;"who can it be?""Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.""La!"replied Kitty,"it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.	2720.550785328449
Mr. what's his name.	1405.0782387177387
Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	2598.999238332846
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.	2673.838760086005
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.	3085.1766211585605
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.	2600.8730247202416
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	2293.6008826274588
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.	2983.5405278452317
Her astonishment at his coming - - at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.	2826.6905802756646
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.	2834.6063547249296
But she would not be secure.	1581.6535125329121
"Let me first see how he behaves,"said she;"it will then be early enough for expectation."She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	2791.440132694653
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.	2650.586378682973
On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	2804.1493867810905
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	2637.35060594886
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	1549.1726028625696
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	2212.951939076028
He was received by Mrs.	1247.1561970500127
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.	2817.269782019158
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs.	1954.104078398878
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	2654.552951712776
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.	2407.1492498243874
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	3073.684157151923
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"said she.	2159.909523234423
"Yet why did he come?"She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.	2630.8121797811095
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"said Mrs.	1562.7951874349524
Bennet.	450.3779225555953
He readily agreed to it.	1767.0021223845913
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	1767.6545435392402
People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.	3024.406194876793
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.	2574.2318545397143
Miss Lucas is married and settled.	2217.802470143194
And one of my own daughters.	2205.613503769301
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.	2271.0595477219504
Did you see it?"Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	2782.945704429023
How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.	2610.689548298106
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"continued her mother,"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.	2439.8941566962462
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.	2523.4317362247752
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	2455.0772505629384
Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	2930.1141981577657
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.	2795.032457966824
A few weeks, he believed.	2390.8928505437025
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,"said her mother,"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr. Bennet's manor.	2411.2076195390373
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.	2779.7195267391235
"The first wish of my heart,"said she to herself,"is never more to be in company with either of them.	2500.8057923713363
Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her former lover.	2979.7115261181634
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	2658.458253936942
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.	2698.0957258744515
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.	2371.483731685937
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.	2036.075645478867
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.	2622.832990446466
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year.	2817.8686680818205
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.	2593.3933996854066
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"said she,"did he come at all?"She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	2381.405742851992
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?	2493.356060960322
If he fears me, why come hither?	2081.2652895723672
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?	2220.198630483819
Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him."Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.	3093.4969170023296
"Now,"said she,"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.	1871.5390793893864
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.	1373.160288300331
It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.""Yes, very indifferent indeed,"said Elizabeth, laughingly.	2333.681081156364
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.	2546.555585793381
When they repaired to the dining - room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.	2631.145371531751
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.	2848.858431596887
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	2036.2051259224722
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half - laughing alarm.	2698.4891243786083
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	2901.1483523252527
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.	2569.7676160314
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	1781.5161478565778
He was on one side of her mother.	1568.8117690133959
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.	2408.4743466926184
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did.	2449.242712153961
Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.	2702.7677257859245
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	2640.0974518154535
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing - room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.	2915.765659790157
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	2463.583141730624
"If he does not come to me, _then_,"said she,"I shall give him up for ever."The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.	2662.8249977403907
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.	2798.237202972073
We want none of them; do we?"Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	2651.1837846845438
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	2922.0238761792516
Annesley is with her.	3088.2165139917147
When the tea - things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.	2806.5800877924075
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	2698.7186406418773
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	2625.1826059236582
"Well girls,"said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,"What say you to the day?	1924.5771549113192
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.	2182.2560772987813
The venison was roasted to a turn - - and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.	2554.8980639199835
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.	2815.631469860427
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.	2472.4520939372605
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.	2820.562426180929
And what do you think she said besides?	2149.8826586020537
'Ah! Mrs.	3088.2165139917147
I do think Mrs.	971.7080658339894
Long is as good a creature as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."Mrs.	2811.3475855085703
"It has been a very agreeable day,"said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.	2099.144012196429
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	2256.658860542731
I hope we may often meet again."Elizabeth smiled.	1992.7461639973
"Lizzy, you must not do so.	1751.630547870233
You must not suspect me.	1438.3497118812938
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	2513.8240959141426
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man.""You are very cruel,"said her sister,"you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.""How hard it is in some cases to be believed!""And how impossible in others!""But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?""That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	2788.3400833403275
We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	2640.559909666268
His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.	2683.733139942877
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.	2349.387807668219
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	2624.129481514255
"Next time you call,"said she,"I hope we shall be more lucky."He should be particularly happy at any time, & c.	2093.347922602208
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.	2477.969212052412
In ran Mrs.	1737.6852019407577
Make haste, make haste.	2747.821204987431
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair.""We will be down as soon as we can,"said Jane;"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.""Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it?	2916.6140702137964
After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.	2823.550060771137
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.	3004.7275275761262
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.	2558.030753590924
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said,"What is the matter mamma?	2658.4219763587994
What do you keep winking at me for?	2575.141422840782
What am I to do?""Nothing child, nothing.	2629.860459027819
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	2847.8983029006677
In a few minutes, Mrs.	1553.5732636937119
Bennet half opened the door and called out,"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."Elizabeth was forced to go.	2613.737696388204
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.	2451.5898736355157
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room."Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing - room.	2692.9519401476796
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	1575.5734513546977
Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	2672.7625231785364
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	2896.4603279014686
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	1993.1305965496929
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.	2877.8925261290683
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.	2793.1405287886123
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.	2050.7843800884884
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.	2735.8997487420133
Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.	2126.2408565948585
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	2660.5788775264364
But on returning to the drawing - room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.	2622.487848691995
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.	2959.8146602497004
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse.	3148.651643937304
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.	2787.339361195692
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	2737.4149389828167
I do not deserve it.	939.5703956193421
Oh! why is not every body as happy?"Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.	2819.000617636336
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.	2770.5126280865666
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.	2244.3150085919756
He is gone to my father already.	1670.5276804225891
Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	2912.2750781765308
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.	2606.6275094154894
"And this,"said she,"is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.	2534.949698911298
"Where is your sister?"said he hastily, as he opened the door.	2335.021541621197
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.	2459.302180106199
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super - excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.	2947.43719540045
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.	2523.737036494924
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,"Jane, I congratulate you.	2823.3917610411404
You will be a very happy woman."Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.	2560.318170841167
"You are a good girl;"he replied,"and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.	2235.2734270986452
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.	1651.8629638678583
Your tempers are by no means unlike.	2470.099021463404
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_.""Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,"cried his wife,"what are you talking of?	2708.5497488141878
Why, he has four or five thousand a - year, and very likely more."Then addressing her daughter,"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	2800.44478618155
I knew how it would be.	1434.4131488519356
I always said it must be so, at last.	1911.392615091828
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.	2638.698762075436
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.	2697.637917171812
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.	2087.9539341616146
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.	2735.5791952198215
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	2953.9812234668116
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.	2991.3794501980133
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	2775.011147754056
In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.	2706.237016007047
"He has made me so happy,"said she, one evening,"by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.""I suspected as much,"replied Elizabeth.	2489.219378270709
"But how did he account for it?""It must have been his sister's doing.	2253.907256295622
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	2568.1883998488615
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.""That is the most unforgiving speech,"said Elizabeth,"that I ever heard you utter.	2595.931337730193
Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.""Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!""He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.	3038.037723168347
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.	2726.272583808723
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"cried Jane.	1704.1306611168525
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!""If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.	2681.175341001404
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.	2808.291003066092
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.	2964.7611773104736
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.	1751.9592811489622
Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.	2659.8142595111935
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	2726.288909312527
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.	2879.50397381893
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	2357.2777145469777
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.	2842.3411572198524
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.	2667.1807064435416
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.	1261.6820204945354
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	2377.861704516006
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.	2644.560088267111
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.	2520.61119975975
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	2664.895033349809
That lady I suppose is your mother."Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	2766.9787314269684
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.""Yes, madam,"said Mrs.	1658.5853020700781
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.	1736.5772260887736
"She is my youngest girl but one.	1598.3160461132964
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.""This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."Mrs.	2524.8779223475763
Collins well.""Yes, very well.	1987.380634746497
I saw them the night before last."Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	2708.28326537636
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	2066.62403515928
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.	2741.857885727757
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.	2760.5569824797617
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?"said she, as she looked in her face.	2317.6238946082494
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner: - -"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.	2622.437213466761
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	2817.9777055108198
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.	1634.3557276238005
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.""Miss Bennet,"replied her ladyship, in an angry tone,"you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.	2457.082921606032
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	2814.9221567136155
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.	2526.9074667672903
Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.""If you believed it impossible to be true,"said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain,"I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.	2868.1722761200845
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?	3079.712352739188
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?""I never heard that it was.""And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?""I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	2766.822527386323
_You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer.""This is not to be borne.	2846.0753223863658
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	2120.3686429091617
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	2667.619851788216
You may have drawn him in.""If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.""Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	2654.4449380830865
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.	1480.829308457696
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.""But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.""Let me be rightly understood.	2579.796615581387
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.	2721.4253550019016
No, never.	2199.689313006519
Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.	1201.4009263095083
From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.	2664.5487129518187
It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.	1975.807501559857
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?	2473.2188466516177
Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?""Yes, and I had heard it before.	2699.3248657018926
But what is that to me?	1849.5906571441847
You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.	2479.217869907042
Its completion depended on others.	2868.1877427549675
If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?	2776.232199764105
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?""Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	2780.358985579756
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	2975.6041443293284
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.""These are heavy misfortunes,"replied Elizabeth.	2754.475128765709
"But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.""Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?	2713.602315412522
"Let us sit down.	1521.0630938327831
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.	2597.7766478127382
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	1712.9581642548092
Hear me in silence.	3304.0338263711733
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.	2375.645863919769
They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	2686.271284608161
Their fortune on both sides is splendid.	2457.973447011143
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be.	2916.487236391807
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up.""In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.	2800.848664456735
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.""True.	2321.536295542855
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	2056.5989627620556
But who was your mother?	1720.674584715767
Who are your uncles and aunts?	2773.3043628546006
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?""I will make no promise of the kind.""Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.	2524.30893895778
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.	2064.585842413529
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.	2144.487667315545
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require.""And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	2399.806411145522
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.	1505.4267675413587
Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished - for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable?	2880.236774362885
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged.	3108.810370649697
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	2490.9079916741307
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.	2883.294496064706
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.""Not so hasty, if you please.	2448.599077298344
I have by no means done.	1312.127201607595
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.	2702.329489498609
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched - up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	2497.6161766869536
And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	2540.35341151412
Heaven and earth! - - of what are you thinking?	3174.2098987362506
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?""You can _now_ have nothing farther to say,"she resentfully answered.	2925.092862178771
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.	1689.1691952192969
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.	2181.845932575142
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	1923.9546852892402
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?""Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.	2666.2288324975902
You know my sentiments.""You are then resolved to have him?""I have said no such thing.	2239.5645178198406
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.""It is well.	2492.281180635538
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	2140.3848625905125
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	2413.0473238947725
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern - - and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.""And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.	2943.7154873228524
I shall now know how to act.	1536.030911558227
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.	2615.7909513885056
I came to try you.	1466.6408127799755
I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.	2717.7764832535067
I send no compliments to your mother.	1890.7634770846107
You deserve no such attention.	1943.951414474562
I am most seriously displeased."Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	2318.664376600831
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	2227.0935460588157
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	2638.697716810924
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	2364.962043787643
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	2696.909209043067
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	2712.330294534637
Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.	2547.421580673816
It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.	2734.515084356997
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.	2173.136981139212
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.	2634.1764814423127
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.	2942.3436560367318
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.	2853.6931051189067
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	2899.075210364122
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.	2787.1507800464824
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days,"she added,"I shall know how to understand it.	2310.6806151191995
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.	2025.4684549738613
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."* * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.	2850.8772459290117
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	1913.6085017721812
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	2548.4232293944146
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.	2609.5994086173587
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	2364.834518353876
He then said,"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.	2362.8556241572487
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.	2508.3320458216
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.	2250.931822339067
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,"You look conscious.	2955.7912059034047
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.	3030.0674753509434
This letter is from Mr. Collins.""From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?""Something very much to the purpose of course.	2851.0079385282465
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good - natured, gossiping Lucases.	2737.85061769473
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.	2107.2609967372405
Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	2792.8888132375305
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.""Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?""This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire, - - splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.	3009.016493309556
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.""Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?	3005.252687095698
But now it comes out.""My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	2339.84023159683
We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.""_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.	2876.6149621290274
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?	2951.463706316957
Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!"Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.	2498.3630974990433
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.	2903.9087077095105
Pray read on.""After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	3012.241697140218
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.""Mr. Collins moreover adds,""I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.	2838.5151754247804
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.	2513.4293839115703
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.""_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive - branch.	2922.2200242693034
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.	1625.4121765630905
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	2432.5073472840027
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?""Oh!"cried Elizabeth,"I am excessively diverted.	2632.64022491925
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration.	2794.949760167057
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law.	3014.984942314992
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?	2540.35341151412
Did she call to refuse her consent?"To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.	3018.7008742053476
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.	2344.720719297883
It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.	1742.293792861226
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	2623.70694190721
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.	1998.3883352814216
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.	2677.9705791922056
It was agreed to.	938.2927525882786
Mrs.	119.39296104224451
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.	2428.859546038345
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.	2789.4151128410813
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.	2584.3048809458
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	2805.1299241965653
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.	2902.6909752810925
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.	2249.5994001880263
I did not think Mrs.	1466.7091175874239
Gardiner was so little to be trusted.""You must not blame my aunt.	2422.984631176044
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.	2718.1902528841806
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.	2837.276512333054
But your _family_ owe me nothing.	1849.5906571441847
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_."Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	3071.943133731193
After a short pause, her companion added,"You are too generous to trifle with me.	2535.240280710663
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.	2611.0253363637717
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	3068.504450780274
The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	2760.3468771599746
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.	2908.7941528032575
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.	2199.0835122034305
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	2944.4676513818126
But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	2015.9139232482337
"It taught me to hope,"said he,"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.	2003.0891642890165
It was unpardonable.	740.3946620458912
I cannot think of it without abhorrence.""We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,"said Elizabeth.	2267.6339132672497
The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	2759.191476238924
Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget:'had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner.'Those were your words.	2628.3543673429253
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; - - though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.""I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.	2776.357404303132
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.""I can easily believe it.	2427.555016724505
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me.""Oh! do not repeat what I then said.	2673.7451051137596
These recollections will not do at all.	2911.2239809688785
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."Darcy mentioned his letter.	2425.5313342301224
"Did it,"said he,"did it _soon_ make you think better of me?	1986.5611722321523
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	1645.222035697657
There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.	2560.1450447063607
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.""The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.""When I wrote that letter,"replied Darcy,"I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.""The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	2838.1745110469383
The adieu is charity itself.	1727.2645730490492
But think no more of the letter.	1956.5709204208438
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	2738.0920969296603
You must learn some of my philosophy.	1780.3276585321826
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.""I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	3027.2091656452294
_Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.	3110.11024533032
But with _me_, it is not so.	1887.2107252108467
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	3153.858587432175
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	2024.674774259419
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.	2109.0003920257423
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.	2980.932706806074
By you, I was properly humbled.	2727.4155742392522
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.	1994.4607919935452
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.""Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?""Indeed I had.	2775.3817941601646
What will you think of my vanity?	2525.656053220227
I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.""My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.	2557.6113865724265
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	2188.2979347051814
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?""Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.""I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley.	2855.7219360024615
You blamed me for coming?""No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.""Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	2792.3126643431196
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.""My object _then_,"replied Darcy,"was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.	2931.448823420769
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.	3014.8819761272243
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.	2559.6160180064358
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.	2902.4613041421917
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!"was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	2239.8295311883535
"I must ask whether you were surprised?"said Elizabeth.	1542.4351074667904
"Not at all.	1353.3487756662203
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.""That is to say, you had given your permission.	2510.9131208761064
I guessed as much."And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.	2594.1818003816566
"On the evening before my going to London,"said he"I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	2643.3835198167535
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.	2350.1803421690206
He had never had the slightest suspicion.	1526.7552366677228
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.	2753.931702596146
"Did you speak from your own observation,"said she,"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?""From the former.	2375.273731509048
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	2502.686737002662
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	2774.8080183252496
I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	2264.9319526926065
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	2600.021633848608
He was angry.	870.1691420383486
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	2566.7973384672805
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.	2385.441216517159
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.	2789.96937487064
In the hall they parted.	1582.7255279804579
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.	2426.069711070604
She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.	2279.10058394459
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	2559.5434716701916
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	2071.0124524334115
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	2251.3641554039755
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.	3001.623473907874
At night she opened her heart to Jane.	2473.178530428712
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	2909.342322041583
"You are joking, Lizzy.	1209.3286646231027
This cannot be! - - engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me.	2793.4720836647098
I know it to be impossible.""This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	2371.230939223811
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.	2992.4743687442974
He still loves me, and we are engaged."Jane looked at her doubtingly.	2419.964331005197
"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be.	1525.0816508742055
I know how much you dislike him.""You know nothing of the matter.	2072.7792583116343
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.	2804.1875419894695
But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.	2100.726590433794
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	2678.4808254897116
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"cried Jane.	2268.44924194449
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain?	2034.516434605507
forgive the question - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?""There can be no doubt of that.	3116.4813632099253
But are you pleased, Jane?	1849.5906571441847
Shall you like to have such a brother?""Very, very much.	3148.681836404659
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.	2644.241330962485
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	2130.132275908626
And do you really love him quite well enough?	2413.1600618808147
Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection.	2706.8878303614924
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?""Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all.""What do you mean?""Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.	2727.9257779514724
I want to talk very seriously.	1608.3202028137625
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	2530.776247340521
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	2928.8065752855837
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.	2640.358650813313
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.	2544.1900529325053
"Now I am quite happy,"said she,"for you will be as happy as myself.	1913.9911410645625
I always had a value for him.	1707.8323775596616
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.	3070.045814139743
But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	2341.9273997312835
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you."Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	2931.5195822889477
But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.	2339.5996000530267
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.	2698.942363209911
* * * * *"Good gracious!"cried Mrs.	2062.8593198521276
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.	2506.434367450794
What shall we do with him?	2465.033989740316
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.	2917.788753569704
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud,"Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day?""I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"said Mrs.	2632.0550656598207
Bennet,"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.	1687.077769325171
Wont it, Kitty?"Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	3148.651643937304
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.	2425.661722919556
Bennet followed her, saying,"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.	2672.8209732054816
But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.	2504.5615475058667
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.	2646.7526488324215
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.	2377.513821227224
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	2437.993312697706
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.	2854.6256595351756
* * * * * In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.	2779.9529396923667
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	2927.010967411532
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper,"Go to your father, he wants you in the library."She was gone directly.	2722.0758214121574
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	2275.3871540642726
"Lizzy,"said he,"what are you doing?	1439.0396740468152
Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?	2881.2953973848194
Have not you always hated him?"How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.	2949.2714181106844
He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.	2348.511003663033
But will they make you happy?""Have you any other objection,"said Elizabeth,"than your belief of my indifference?""None at all.	2363.967020409788
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.""I do, I do like him,"she replied, with tears in her eyes,"I love him.	2680.2431730039593
Indeed he has no improper pride.	2892.3167359545387
He is perfectly amiable.	1232.8880024261412
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.""Lizzy,"said her father,"I have given him my consent.	2592.7562907097813
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	2485.3396926280698
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.	2336.4395725329423
But let me advise you to think better of it.	2189.2146243912553
I know your disposition, Lizzy.	1455.7176167599087
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.	2056.5244698983633
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	2702.1281743615723
You know not what you are about."Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	2915.127197709803
"Well, my dear,"said he, when she ceased speaking,"I have no more to say.	1732.7171803393903
If this be the case, he deserves you.	2445.3570908887637
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.	2639.456828092745
He heard her with astonishment.	1485.2505763899505
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better.	2574.2251652138557
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.	2053.725506623935
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.	2883.310163205936
I shall offer to pay him to - morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go - - saying, as she quitted the room,"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.	2833.411886299299
Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.	2905.0168987632956
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.	2972.5617315315067
Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.	2256.066062231962
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.	2986.3813080572554
She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.	2605.57198887201
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true?	2476.1787649393427
Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin - money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it - - nothing at all.	2836.695953590139
I am so pleased - - so happy.	1413.2143231958803
Such a charming man! - - so handsome! so tall! - - Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	2857.211861742003
I hope he will overlook it.	1522.02648546082
Dear, dear Lizzy.	3304.0338263711733
But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.	2268.154522255274
"My dearest child,"she cried,"I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence.	2435.454085157127
You must and shall be married by a special licence.	1971.9006321600702
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to - morrow."This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'consent, there was still something to be wished for.	2884.302446019332
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.	2078.402729247326
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.	2683.919508422185
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.	2516.859512811069
"I admire all my three sons - in - law highly,"said he.	1850.311981218157
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's."Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	2683.115741894012
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?""I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.	2665.785251369867
It is too long ago.	1194.7369679693072
I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.""My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners - - my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	2734.540880297703
I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.	2294.3931278447008
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.	2957.585264453113
There - - I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.	2825.0464087102964
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me - - but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.""Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?""Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her?	2863.447267049709
But make a virtue of it by all means.	2123.131713278941
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.	2925.7870973828253
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?	2797.457221660323
Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?""Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.""But I was embarrassed.""And so was I.""You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.""A man who had felt less, might.""How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	2958.3361909131863
I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.	2554.010336365968
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?	3070.7125303622456
This will never do.""You need not distress yourself.	2631.0823761318916
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	1876.2166609636606
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.	2059.3334758665064
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.""Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.	2848.732050009211
But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?	2297.2394196781574
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	3183.311443368421
or had you intended any more serious consequence?""My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.	3047.7666897404
But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.""And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	2753.9067658580434
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over - rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.	2554.158621834083
Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.	2877.9508512232874
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.	2746.9983412517804
You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	2366.3850789985054
I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.	2220.994951564217
How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	2739.5270515284333
We will go round the Park every day.	2439.40478373982
I am the happiest creature in the world.	1189.1544025916003
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.	2892.248335783777
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.	1879.7985482536462
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me.	1881.0478620795363
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	2076.57107595897
Your's, & c."Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.	2296.952970589997
"DEAR SIR,"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	2271.5738312182775
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.	1727.3261334425783
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.	2015.935831307915
He has more to give.	1385.3577418331492
Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	2737.3781258823115
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.	2927.7130138898724
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.	3106.795821446728
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.	2792.861623561944
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.	2793.5506448878978
He bore it however with admirable calmness.	1767.926644396726
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.	2603.325769926764
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.	2556.077926871415
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	2813.5216098912306
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.	2957.2652601400455
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.	2561.2975634737386
Darcy may be guessed.	2571.924922829479
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well - informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.	2830.2422111753713
He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	2371.144277530981
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	2773.6371601158057
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.	2839.8767186102973
In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.	2595.0549948393386
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.	2537.9728827486247
Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.	1575.5734513546977
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters'beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.	2971.0428485761236
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.	2782.9522819646018
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	2734.291526654589
The letter was to this effect:"MY DEAR LIZZY,"I wish you joy.	2279.2943602397836
It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.	2287.312176495395
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.	2315.13181214592
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.	3035.429210803157
"Yours, & c."As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	2466.190996686285
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.	2877.4659013221208
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.	2857.4434893868065
Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.	2822.705080432725
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.	2438.6147819333205
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	2944.971461163521
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	2927.2133402719032
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.	2174.492504593934
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.	2973.6775948890213
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.	2643.8650177887826
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.	2429.1498553572364
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	2898.030001813248
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	2566.411058423184
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	2923.133490874531
