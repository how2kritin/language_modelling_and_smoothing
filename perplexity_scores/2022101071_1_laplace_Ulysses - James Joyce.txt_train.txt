821.8096255608078
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	948.6572427963229
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	968.5321635132444
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	2169.5802568214676
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	1096.7845383592596
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	1077.8452991942183
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	682.3501809478738
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	992.976545364616
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	1155.0814126295138
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	550.0145631936922
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	784.0172985144654
Slow music, please.	619.5441972330808
Shut your eyes, gents.	556.05399990297
One moment.	258.35973552576525
Silence, all.	167.63089106830853
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	1138.0363617734222
Chrysostomos.	316.5108355747976
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	1980.2500452620563
That will do nicely.	506.3531159517341
Switch off the current, will you?	542.850601855305
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	954.1570490364387
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	2181.467473022768
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	1050.4607570443382
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	283.7709834077444
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	864.8634098435974
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	873.3860761929942
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	447.92219952474744
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	821.838780031023
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	575.8116273434067
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	806.8208717728813
We must go to Athens.	613.0929578506325
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	909.8195486351353
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	536.956240798826
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	1036.0183500519122
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	266.61206853490324
— Yes, my love?	215.74124084848876
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	1131.353831807423
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	386.4711112360533
he said frankly.	218.33950627053585
A ponderous Saxon.	876.0806055454592
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	307.09488483048904
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	929.2625903986842
Because he comes from Oxford.	579.8457606085019
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	399.5180136162823
He can ’ t make you out.	219.4089230006323
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	336.9440530639573
He shaved warily over his chin.	1034.4986762685967
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	425.7766595244245
Where is his guncase?	596.3569418782151
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	659.0734040018427
Were you in a funk?	475.2270664176812
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	341.9321753491773
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	674.6615216290501
I ’ m not a hero, however.	242.38622317192383
If he stays on here I am off.	446.9573866389494
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	789.1793847095777
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	1380.0920306531648
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	706.4573039733381
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	705.532683011515
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	944.7890519220612
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	1284.1343167705054
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	798.6685409354837
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	450.30894664540483
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	1238.0287894492901
— God! he said quietly.	225.62600672408703
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	782.2422256787071
The snotgreen sea.	525.0381249140671
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	3351.415993340726
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	349.65264031203793
You must read them in the original.	328.6543789630999
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	1037.2475168483481
Come and look.	168.16460560928962
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	309.77685290539074
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	641.4756122785385
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	637.2610384234287
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	529.3290823145529
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	442.0637682361833
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	361.6092669138641
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	584.3993308156812
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	500.19062364610033
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	375.6145643377366
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	542.5614916114785
And you refused.	317.65701709854727
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	1162.7194468758848
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	1218.3729861200677
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	480.8206646904744
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	658.9435601416122
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	1385.6582290161928
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	438.0621902702316
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	1014.0647330573331
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	1287.9040752249573
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	1048.1488344876484
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	2686.768640352175
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	1018.1162010904235
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	335.9079475906181
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	464.0586630629944
How are the secondhand breeks?	1041.1447242185093
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	519.3643703993636
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	1542.9439025170893
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	265.6859161635615
Secondleg they should be.	582.4679393694265
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	447.9095628888918
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	423.6698182075181
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	355.74562213907143
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	653.2348774625538
— Thanks, Stephen said.	164.59964576451918
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	417.90329258289233
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	358.0180752507352
Etiquette is etiquette.	976.7604941698461
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	691.2451975046423
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	656.8978656551941
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	401.9083275004087
p.	168.1714758313536
i.	199.38933213025123
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	632.1134172218353
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	1011.9632009557272
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	1298.297400742702
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	2542.608777416051
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	689.5183315971709
Hair on end.	440.94962187800394
As he and others see me.	257.12276998178373
Who chose this face for me?	676.1633609591839
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	1018.7125336857005
It asks me too.	434.24103414546687
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	362.30102902589357
It does her all right.	283.15240391835067
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	2148.9787133478244
Lead him not into temptation.	941.4106834429753
And her name is Ursula.	412.51961963837635
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	492.8168542039324
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	380.9820359768299
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	762.1098876875683
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	598.8932737938256
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	615.2674326595683
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	305.345906607892
he said kindly.	203.30681272565832
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	526.3825133875345
Parried again.	520.2006954658831
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	404.5021471360125
The cold steel pen.	807.4223453706509
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	887.4784024593578
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	383.24298917937267
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	1630.4554999708068
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	481.64951751928504
Hellenise it.	296.9853790920443
Cranly ’ s arm.	318.3139996095258
His arm.	226.59303356391928
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	531.170574735443
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	247.90070617737123
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	582.6619482850592
What have you up your nose against me?	474.4576226080543
Is it Haines?	401.9669925771252
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	1354.5798451996063
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	1979.7506916283055
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	1053.6286087013798
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	1113.2060059929945
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	1278.765705284755
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	909.0979602393496
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	2166.8819261280273
To ourselves...	134.54865979905244
new paganism...	179.45656345356755
omphalos.	362.3144614049264
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	266.97318235045196
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	458.019899102981
— Then what is it?	226.6191202536999
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	810.5069537345132
Cough it up.	297.1880265326312
I ’ m quite frank with you.	369.08575187377716
What have you against me now?	359.0484449276627
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	981.6384073388504
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	757.5122813079405
— Do you wish me to tell you?	389.6989522377155
he asked.	89.54079260770219
— Yes, what is it?	163.97345429210512
I don ’ t remember anything.	313.9824042425516
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	259.78979279123143
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	1420.004337402311
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	472.2956976888066
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	554.9726266372613
Where?	201.5556843520298
I can ’ t remember anything.	295.8963206839378
I remember only ideas and sensations.	659.5258722057714
Why?	203.35538390318914
What happened in the name of God?	275.24212743487465
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	505.49611364141805
She asked you who was in your room.	309.5164644372093
— Yes?	165.58320782341158
Buck Mulligan said.	229.6114754313757
What did I say?	272.90848308937865
I forget.	131.03546634219092
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	863.6451429574504
— Did I say that?	247.50404526458595
he asked.	89.54079260770219
Well?	214.94171844774678
What harm is that?	338.8871163792488
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	793.9844943757594
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	373.63998318579786
You saw only your mother die.	637.6164820422172
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	782.9830404862809
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	395.51437049782794
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	562.7700049904166
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	682.979731811964
Why?	203.35538390318914
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	307.41419921776327
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	2180.168524858743
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	1813.5945056932405
Humour her till it ’ s over.	313.4155676228592
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	1135.853070581333
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	388.1440622826254
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	454.1139700493859
He had spoken himself into boldness.	795.4981268743745
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	576.3466471004941
— Of what then?	342.13800464850016
Buck Mulligan asked.	332.95094357404355
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	287.8564063817668
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	721.5422008289339
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	449.62536254176297
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	543.032219200036
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	754.5786521759894
Sea and headland now grew dim.	1591.1964058850217
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	596.2749322942291
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	611.881462089101
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	312.6071961774018
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	300.33876862543946
What does it care about offences?	1026.1088311866451
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	1174.0756284202275
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	462.3638848970757
I ’ m inconsequent.	299.94285340629983
Give up the moody brooding.	867.9909975765142
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	1866.9310474506244
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	1709.0297296788501
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	1543.3922711506045
White breast of the dim sea.	622.8900359077865
The twining stresses, two by two.	588.8768730961675
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	1606.682121730175
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	2367.736242623763
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	1031.575914704823
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	626.3706297684279
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	556.7254463771204
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	542.3845224993221
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	787.6767806847955
She was crying in her wretched bed.	555.6256369892557
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	521.563589372921
Where now?	297.5236216382935
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	1985.5836424951315
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	1089.500493429399
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	1510.8062921985631
And no more turn aside and brood.	663.4015802170326
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	559.9874642121991
Memories beset his brooding brain.	3043.92991347395
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	853.598154109756
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	1128.4564758083475
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	1476.972165246254
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	1063.1065910033506
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	666.4657309304995
On me alone.	320.75765350976246
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	659.4197722681847
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	783.0255501739174
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	1396.643412821874
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	386.1219787221107
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	3385.793029300455
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	826.5357935337335
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	571.9578789257216
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	647.6125982457472
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	293.22193478595113
Breakfast is ready.	733.0578146496371
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	1157.0269636539817
It ’ s all right.	153.31602933233913
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	195.38824425660212
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	325.3514393627232
For my sake and for all our sakes.	602.0033849805543
His head disappeared and reappeared.	767.552321848005
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	440.20077251820067
He says it ’ s very clever.	277.9867001827876
Touch him for a quid, will you?	342.84192411487976
A guinea, I mean.	246.18859204095355
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	291.7820813910208
— The school kip?	660.0094524683858
Buck Mulligan said.	229.6114754313757
How much?	348.7683804441188
Four quid?	1008.988366345069
Lend us one.	453.75827331879833
— If you want it, Stephen said.	193.10547996460474
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	1126.4915629753166
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	1178.8557453034618
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	2447.442065417706
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	1121.6708473424292
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	776.4018445202512
Why should I bring it down?	516.8233220609466
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	819.9900110515497
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	647.8401687763687
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	731.521481285677
I am another now and yet the same.	291.9434162955285
A server of a servant.	354.1393709153503
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	1505.7394373511547
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	1432.6108970050027
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	396.6868155580099
Haines, open that door, will you?	276.3598182244725
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	473.4314318167753
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	846.4860368047878
— Have you the key?	330.0770769139296
a voice asked.	149.54317593510874
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	250.88017825599096
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	1328.3784017668927
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	338.1710442698871
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	830.515875606689
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	659.2332255317566
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	685.9726447929971
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	214.85543016078665
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	684.4955312604587
Haines, come in.	131.4047995576393
The grub is ready.	594.3554644673299
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	673.817148427604
Where ’ s the sugar?	249.34576582831477
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	262.0267909612946
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	580.4963516288719
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	778.0933396109535
— What sort of a kip is this?	405.3178700127557
I told her to come after eight.	342.3459921645953
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	500.3696587282868
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	263.68305614914743
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	529.9522364101795
I want Sandycove milk.	552.0146342049479
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	390.3880228584335
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	543.9311630378121
Sit down.	306.6643870560772
Pour out the tea there.	403.597454584159
The sugar is in the bag.	254.70905648646016
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	555.0147178515685
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	1847.3769655980682
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	360.2206146094036
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	316.64279573178516
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	867.7168307789565
And when I makes water I makes water.	522.3111078229341
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	336.2130010257529
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	714.8456630884673
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	942.1480167339615
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	338.3618853264136
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	993.5695486581437
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	569.7131431603607
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	673.1601889798111
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	262.7084206671976
— Do you now?	265.3694345950662
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	330.98419607756557
Your reasons, pray?	815.9547404878635
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	341.3255558659012
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	905.849277501766
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	511.9900868563458
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	795.7790486218686
Do you think she was?	334.342402507845
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	1324.399352633355
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	574.3175177000114
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	901.8629665966573
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	269.3356079149574
Kinch, get the jug.	285.6455491663638
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	574.467557141999
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	187.16883664135213
Glory be to God.	312.8958750722804
— To whom?	379.75346965526364
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	231.3208764379614
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	507.593552630063
— How much, sir?	263.36745146663407
asked the old woman.	166.940126899373
— A quart, Stephen said.	217.0967836714977
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	1006.5483540393562
Old shrunken paps.	1933.0051771139551
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	744.7390418818007
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	722.2335807902065
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	415.7467086392402
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	1507.679114139907
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	1220.6818425613665
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	562.7317881982344
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	1568.6791084821493
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	1024.0958256907948
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	628.9224299916978
— Taste it, sir, she said.	197.2850246553005
He drank at her bidding.	438.37351812926926
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	693.792232001143
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	1550.4670936656562
— Are you a medical student, sir?	456.8123440386212
the old woman asked.	166.940126899373
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	348.0654528353532
— Look at that now, she said.	183.99465492020596
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	893.3600456622298
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	712.376178987045
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	867.0572616761854
— Do you understand what he says?	397.3938630705917
Stephen asked her.	153.36416183237756
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	438.7722347211681
the old woman said to Haines.	185.44601629833298
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	722.5165136341562
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	227.79694987244588
Is there Gaelic on you?	526.8214895632143
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	169.99160282611882
Are you from the west, sir?	305.50253678688136
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	434.6552915436238
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	388.8374582495359
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	335.5726166306039
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	353.9754855935851
Wonderful entirely.	910.25641350066
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	714.6547974323834
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	467.3037909047407
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	333.67166104812327
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	439.50646608123145
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	470.5975848650036
Stephen filled again the three cups.	613.8533305233818
— Bill, sir?	333.9150935692322
she said, halting.	227.29705945031444
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	1299.7095279669616
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	219.77877537074812
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	1364.4966012558757
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	373.321582731251
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	1355.1546401894814
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	586.4487781972862
All I can give you I give.	307.6226511258878
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	552.0643895481828
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	375.6321820813286
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	289.91334624497307
Time enough.	380.3241623202064
Good morning, sir.	230.3378595388478
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	571.7635592565782
I ’ m stony.	275.4632880245225
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	970.5955383778692
Today the bards must drink and junket.	1173.3080531603239
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	886.8099324672536
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	559.8962754182992
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	495.333656630314
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	685.8174325446471
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	741.080455741418
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	735.907507836425
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	965.5813136248735
Speaking to me.	234.30282449273398
They wash and tub and scrub.	831.0590143214208
Agenbite of inwit.	531.0162166691946
Conscience.	316.5108355747976
Yet here ’ s a spot.	314.5863521937254
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	812.7470726640558
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	611.3202465283681
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	268.1391600841716
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	376.99879265162434
— Would I make any money by it?	478.41825659998005
Stephen asked.	140.93745844441872
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	383.4603336617326
He strolled out to the doorway.	277.479971250338
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	748.2667590882946
— Well?	197.17406020515273
Stephen said.	88.57131846105065
The problem is to get money.	353.1387965849599
From whom?	579.3677716727975
From the milkwoman or from him.	348.0226682641793
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	217.00574250418825
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	811.323616666089
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	209.36178800621354
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	701.9567712013448
— From me, Kinch, he said.	168.21250477470898
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	552.4068773574235
Damn all else they are good for.	497.20078446246
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	429.12107094081216
To hell with them all.	276.4738107238888
Let us get out of the kip.	356.26046828957357
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	874.8936349223718
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	359.99701860228146
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	232.85445031595646
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	809.8426790347993
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	351.5240497934758
I want puce gloves and green boots.	849.5651112868837
Contradiction.	362.3144614049264
Do I contradict myself?	961.0932109613524
Very well then, I contradict myself.	597.0321166633189
Mercurial Malachi.	750.2667881712988
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	1009.0970170716066
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	322.39533750972
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	250.51789854649846
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	453.7527156004319
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	371.78460197833715
Come out, Kinch.	221.5552530519633
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	403.7608887016616
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	1065.1111221559895
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	555.6516023198118
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	549.855767426155
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	627.3359315341364
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	174.2379192655636
He walked on.	145.55149668935476
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	1781.8814244914684
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	770.327149354325
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	486.97006754372933
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	568.6146762760825
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	987.9776717079532
Martello you call it?	580.7178446834638
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	561.4339333211461
But ours is the _omphalos_.	554.3670606834235
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	395.1080480797526
Haines asked Stephen.	293.2748920748055
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	383.02559296943963
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	801.009356600771
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	484.57865028419104
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	702.9858435162636
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	649.6817073034363
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	984.2458603918412
Is it some paradox?	768.0206971986307
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	474.4690604230407
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	774.5526026807978
It ’ s quite simple.	305.19420682346714
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	602.1397941584067
— What?	133.89864297395368
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	330.32284917962056
He himself?	190.9625483697255
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	649.667143942372
And it is rather long to tell.	296.0964492881074
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	487.50994399672425
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	585.5058911536021
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	842.0775189893202
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	888.6370524362502
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	948.7489053554066
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	1841.5276650561784
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	478.8418256487875
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	764.004848960408
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	1120.1291110846034
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	531.0493433921288
The Father and the Son idea.	288.4863504701453
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	701.8884289466288
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	1153.4191932098367
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	995.4695131070479
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	676.058606390297
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	290.5262408967615
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	1273.736994018031
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	559.6316742295999
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	836.8391782727616
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	700.9218905552492
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	1259.10194727891
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	561.9764810098986
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	376.86608293762873
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	255.70850330391747
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	615.5710072269947
What did he call it?	286.97491846149876
Joseph the Joiner?	716.0058278723715
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	572.974971609689
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	257.4798868403202
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	511.85498294048045
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	306.1622025860895
Haines asked.	232.17785429397637
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	320.0344088303885
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	726.8632140192377
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	238.44835836785586
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	1058.5548123344886
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	266.3233795813038
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	530.7297068240773
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	698.4730133809927
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	163.65012496625735
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	470.91729135675035
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	658.4790152957929
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	332.9589039954209
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	699.0756673371509
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	410.2771763208415
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	1337.127701114188
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	880.0181759088072
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	372.5845136449599
He wants that key.	366.7302060505813
It is mine.	236.2398351050632
I paid the rent.	264.6985081702806
Now I eat his salt bread.	650.642240485037
Give him the key too.	311.17570297494893
All.	82.2426250579767
He will ask for it.	221.0059892201095
That was in his eyes.	127.97557709502973
— After all, Haines began...	170.0254139022941
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	637.8172474871118
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	522.7102953506851
You are your own master, it seems to me.	371.45737914009254
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	392.63502880589584
— Italian?	290.31818761009555
Haines said.	145.91080965451854
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	557.5740930203141
Kneel down before me.	549.6735930852795
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	439.36071264162774
— Italian?	290.31818761009555
Haines said again.	233.7519892190331
What do you mean?	363.57648093939093
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	875.930892248336
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	1577.6734254350797
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	331.9883704917097
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	612.5763445984738
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	1101.822591424386
It seems history is to blame.	694.0553807164231
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	2424.201507845703
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	1582.992166024287
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	1255.9519051507773
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	848.8780629241263
Idle mockery.	1132.9651678195964
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	995.0322439100906
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	1003.8423264698389
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	617.1593704617037
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	696.5020806130731
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	412.9475318417287
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	758.2736869349219
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	561.3802842770605
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	818.0957822416366
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	278.4406618733403
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	494.71417047275804
It ’ s nine days today.	412.8216522537902
The man that was drowned.	248.20562559558397
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	1179.9004364782115
Here I am.	211.8065018164853
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	649.2976760140212
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	913.4555902393644
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	859.2321034441276
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	277.9278286933326
— Down in Westmeath.	438.6806562233624
With the Bannons.	315.99187577864006
— Still there?	264.41607332974496
I got a card from Bannon.	415.56708665548064
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	666.206215582942
Photo girl he calls her.	584.5743733716589
— Snapshot, eh?	479.38377947662116
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	833.9079184801388
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	1126.9902046519608
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	832.4289850509139
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	567.3525769328243
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	300.08517254565527
— Going over next week to stew.	908.5535348666442
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	950.7830035460759
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	451.319875538313
The father is rotto with money.	471.7179387720855
— Is she up the pole?	398.8780696601266
— Better ask Seymour that.	561.6813106708024
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	755.2005396470925
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	1054.280905582812
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	821.934404288454
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	679.9328615785222
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	334.0463642473952
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	549.6160850993208
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	362.4722395091378
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
Make room in the bed.	319.29712724822593
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	958.5889645892045
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	470.1712394361343
— Are you not coming in?	298.1614667939989
Buck Mulligan asked.	332.95094357404355
— Later on, Haines said.	273.9805707828669
Not on my breakfast.	331.6590604836713
Stephen turned away.	256.8324006728767
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	142.92050052345456
Stephen handed him the key.	330.281455715211
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	1050.2790616425573
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	206.35827376797525
Throw it there.	282.8905926444004
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	859.9762174043053
Dressing, undressing.	605.3018596215895
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	696.7045653363189
Thus spake Zarathustra.	2697.0133318941353
His plump body plunged.	1142.8416343722704
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	509.9671414315761
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	394.95988710353373
Half twelve.	572.8536707183923
— Good, Stephen said.	137.1241600867892
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	751.1146725372386
Liliata rutilantium.	1132.9651678195964
Turma circumdet.	1287.2969652097265
Iubilantium te virginum.	2245.4070998740754
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	1030.5777740924177
I will not sleep here tonight.	500.82395484849303
Home also I cannot go.	955.8719979813106
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	639.9543622957888
It called again.	292.03811590994553
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	349.1476932001984
Usurper.	362.3144614049264
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	420.10365981413526
— Tarentum, sir.	256.157582582077
— Very good.	240.26819695010892
Well?	214.94171844774678
— There was a battle, sir.	223.7648973276974
— Very good.	240.26819695010892
Where?	201.5556843520298
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	576.7240105694314
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	500.074365144025
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	531.654857596451
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	613.9397746300019
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	1059.0380670497796
What ’ s left us then?	298.2646584575093
— I forget the place, sir.	171.43031540993042
<NUM> B.	183.03849675433574
C.	105.94139119590463
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	465.71977778090894
— Yes, sir.	120.02413405031919
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	827.0650490171888
A dull ease of the mind.	424.11478449236773
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	1243.1249486453319
Any general to any officers.	858.3783554779368
They lend ear.	660.0841767850595
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	188.10220191658317
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	308.39478035622164
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	457.3492464840776
— I know, sir.	112.41758782596145
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	352.67893160618104
— Wait.	126.24444533673254
You, Armstrong.	208.00864859858626
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	858.9955257047017
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	1347.2226112978349
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	1158.9618397647764
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	609.900487453524
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	515.5165093074269
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	760.879306757965
Vico Road, Dalkey.	1286.038464278722
— Pyrrhus, sir?	291.70170262267453
Pyrrhus, a pier.	282.15352747345554
All laughed.	263.45717550503406
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	2613.4377018489627
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	1442.584940050744
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	919.0768184991649
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	329.20605513059013
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	321.81280101703635
A thing out in the water.	169.68313199746063
A kind of a bridge.	194.9257606738546
Kingstown pier, sir.	513.6783378388296
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	1129.6172323967794
Two in the back bench whispered.	453.23735503972324
Yes.	79.54417819042295
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	1114.1476484899472
All.	82.2426250579767
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	1103.4955974380428
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	1058.4250414182172
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	370.6739085970415
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	319.4832600406118
The words troubled their gaze.	679.9279994521701
— How, sir?	184.40648800504925
Comyn asked.	462.53109291745363
A bridge is across a river.	472.9242230241124
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	482.8877638518285
No - one here to hear.	325.4836439747753
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	1322.566394281361
What then?	205.40394694590825
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	880.9018964834299
Why had they chosen all that part?	686.3220056451952
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	1013.2523098306772
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	827.3130733077918
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	1639.8944281260412
They are not to be thought away.	311.54679251000687
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	1134.7348534752484
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	811.9357282379848
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	600.9186794682325
Weave, weaver of the wind.	435.2802750874363
— Tell us a story, sir.	296.3417620166485
— O, do, sir.	111.54239693332825
A ghoststory.	337.893462741676
— Where do you begin in this?	439.2446340106824
Stephen asked, opening another book.	472.0127566656522
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	478.9728338720692
— And the story, sir?	207.08380245308484
— After, Stephen said.	145.97045721272082
Go on, Talbot.	266.816711636204
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	1194.23688483475
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	940.1729971531208
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	1170.4028291590766
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	1927.929399146712
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	1459.61382230154
Thought is the thought of thought.	281.67320500360694
Tranquil brightness.	1106.2884715782523
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	291.3676156753533
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	990.7112038218822
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	480.1711771829608
I don ’ t see anything.	249.57215948709077
— What, sir?	152.43183252788356
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	863.8793505398904
His hand turned the page over.	366.31428193328406
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	496.0031901815873
Of him that walked the waves.	310.9353474815696
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	881.2802837155496
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	1021.2504112604988
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	365.8570554505291
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	795.4308503184167
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	854.0069041451418
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	1245.5659859874931
— Have I heard all?	318.6367834270736
Stephen asked.	140.93745844441872
— Yes, sir.	120.02413405031919
Hockey at ten, sir.	421.1633359739778
— Half day, sir.	241.83679411699097
Thursday.	185.09665951145675
— Who can answer a riddle?	639.4166219255779
Stephen asked.	140.93745844441872
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	1936.086632791871
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	1741.79608782964
— O, ask me, sir.	162.11667893340874
— A hard one, sir.	204.51564589728633
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	832.6517353254806
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	657.3729198302592
What is that?	152.7196588081259
— What, sir?	152.43183252788356
We didn ’ t hear.	333.9382197604635
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	1172.6252602932093
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	421.8391833898816
We give it up.	225.49071173839957
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	904.1708116193811
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	1078.306591846625
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	840.0731108015514
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	810.4867554858967
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	1793.5212766854427
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	2254.4651194989933
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	847.2775900204626
He held out his copybook.	385.9028734936551
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	770.5832626779354
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	1323.089451820308
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	815.8895068170543
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	268.0421148591368
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	323.84119106527294
Futility.	362.3144614049264
— Do you understand how to do them now?	488.05051884075056
he asked.	89.54079260770219
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	957.6235535718772
— Can you do them yourself?	493.78468083724346
Stephen asked.	140.93745844441872
— No, sir.	115.10066595580012
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	906.610944200945
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	476.39347281851593
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	1282.2617559237563
Was that then real?	562.5424681691609
The only true thing in life?	470.6008763562327
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	1892.2775363799394
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	818.0083479551299
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	1115.073302818267
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	1016.8890319690418
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	780.4474968929957
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	816.1892453226934
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	2644.395490801293
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	714.6078298613642
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	1230.4283031716786
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	768.2592184847874
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	1109.3270782306247
— Do you understand now?	446.8651939418641
Can you work the second for yourself?	566.7970161823325
— Yes, sir.	120.02413405031919
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	2802.450550865512
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	1508.7306666381262
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	2499.0949317280624
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	1496.737608952124
My childhood bends beside me.	1174.2710860697894
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	570.050244544997
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	513.7535771239882
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	1466.184844954152
The sum was done.	369.06179881257776
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	319.361937587106
— Yes, sir.	120.02413405031919
Thanks, Sargent answered.	531.2959707941318
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	863.2576217305227
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	473.4157717778543
— Yes, sir.	120.02413405031919
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	415.1601318229596
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	312.6295589119461
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	1397.4344880138926
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	1772.2054890400764
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	1036.2624060513724
He turned his angry white moustache.	653.0696642130639
he cried continually without listening.	964.8961882646691
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	357.6248678089742
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	576.3282584452111
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	698.3983068760039
What is it now?	211.37290210370168
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	1409.6733151517533
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	1662.5861819677282
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	404.43130835083707
As it was in the beginning, is now.	182.46935778174839
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	865.9138694183767
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	1249.995739856224
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	690.551869264115
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	1051.04848735539
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	494.250718281555
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	789.9632226199346
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	492.0039170944032
And now his strongroom for the gold.	353.2534912135977
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	1160.8156725248216
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	1121.9149340759852
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	494.1311351117664
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	404.51681689767224
These are handy things to have.	719.7631584936382
See.	123.09458315445424
This is for sovereigns.	425.4975360752824
This is for shillings.	290.86582927392425
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	656.4327798130862
And here crowns.	404.3913641933575
See.	123.09458315445424
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	545.3399985085777
— Three twelve, he said.	218.1653997967638
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	239.1136345362212
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	449.86131320489307
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	309.4331039684524
You have earned it.	384.021235243037
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	349.88183035445985
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	430.5728899370655
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	1170.2786088038044
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	313.8400198060538
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	457.74996278914216
You just buy one of these machines.	727.6419158733479
You ’ ll find them very handy.	609.882664479309
Answer something.	484.9115091155459
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	502.0654211778003
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	280.82057073351024
Three times now.	396.6470870792721
Three nooses round me here.	868.4963335025409
Well?	214.94171844774678
I can break them in this instant if I will.	443.05374768299
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	449.1564183535512
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	451.0588537826165
When you have lived as long as I have.	385.5582923944526
I know, I know.	102.3843700725704
If youth but knew.	568.4725188644782
But what does Shakespeare say?	739.3291417460122
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	969.383071300311
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	501.12739437263264
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	299.41960641719686
He made money.	225.52379494003264
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	401.09494338946746
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	382.47177806919933
The seas ’ ruler.	509.0802485168483
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	753.6929111821673
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	325.2128275063061
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	555.1944726991736
That ’ s not English.	215.72116171558403
A French Celt said that.	529.2185950418963
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	956.0508363447653
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	434.8361465996027
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	653.7759569223034
_ — I paid my way.	220.0733843112737
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	665.8006094619992
_I owe <URL> Can you?	1442.785855223042
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	848.9691812612217
Curran, ten guineas.	669.7084501361963
McCann, one guinea.	499.68235737870293
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	898.7975388307005
Temple, two lunches.	637.338268293597
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	1075.600556601199
The lump I have is useless.	539.8516301317138
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	202.83797596114033
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	1022.9017061119655
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	305.2736138247235
But one day you must feel it.	360.0091555978631
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	801.651686539683
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	1475.9664215331243
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	690.3208414956537
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	585.2718957056211
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	231.25319902852613
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	1455.2960438729613
You fenians forget some things.	1098.806096262942
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	876.2168468196545
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	1601.0169673316498
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	890.1952478328926
The black north and true blue bible.	897.3088904390738
Croppies lie down.	867.8874673810595
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	1064.361275329801
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	373.2809575407783
On the spindle side.	476.7979889144787
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	1168.223285567611
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	463.4362531268531
— Alas, Stephen said.	209.98825023496966
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	1107.7374299473188
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	567.2368801268451
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	1092.7866905444332
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	2960.9397736320734
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	384.8864555727292
Day!...	87.81248367365272
Day!...	87.81248367365272
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	1477.634076948781
Lal the ral the ra.	721.9852422473683
Lal the ral the raddy.	822.9565252583649
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	345.20543028495314
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	434.87895910318457
I have a letter here for the press.	244.40937606421696
Sit down a moment.	360.9686644648133
I have just to copy the end.	287.03538838676565
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	574.9877927722533
— Sit down.	266.57417204800316
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	675.2187288745615
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	1187.7093803652992
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	1563.725652112208
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	1583.1362901189113
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	1031.823418041589
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	819.1547505956063
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	1471.8982762552569
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	953.7450453256798
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	1350.0569329663044
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	1375.9289140778674
Again: a goal.	390.81763835077743
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	615.0352831197879
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	1434.2465046344212
Jousts.	316.5108355747976
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	2044.7081134415419
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	1241.224564228339
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	295.32450774266647
Stephen stood up.	207.26288335112696
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	363.02454859587726
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	292.0547239270559
Just look through it.	316.6481163573848
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	505.8502545259807
May I trespass on your valuable space.	1141.471229959788
That doctrine of _laissez faire_ which so often in our history.	1490.7549837857055
Our cattle trade.	1012.0529602497746
The way of all our old industries.	385.0724918042245
Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.	2603.9559221990676
European conflagration.	1424.6282766826969
The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture.	911.4956366605718
Pardoned a classical allusion.	1333.6175296242047
Cassandra.	362.3144614049264
By a woman who was no better than she should be.	496.6118243642033
To come to the point at issue.	358.85661504836423
— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	366.18813996385455
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	410.20275176720304
Foot and mouth disease.	586.2444238021184
Known as Koch ’ s preparation.	1095.000944373866
Percentage of salted horses.	1169.582960640151
Rinderpest.	316.5108355747976

Veterinary surgeons.	1694.178082865129
Mr Henry Blackwood Price.	1255.5810857893314
Courteous offer a fair trial.	1730.6892203285672
Dictates of common sense.	839.9300344244446
Allimportant question.	791.4149235410555
In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.	460.63151178954706
Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	595.2539356096273
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	285.18234120231494
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	1050.5313583740165
And it can be cured.	363.26639648264444
It is cured.	330.69591067271455
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	1533.479060521294
They offer to come over here.	473.5541758916385
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	527.9287494259206
I am surrounded by difficulties, by...	258.25204295259266
intrigues by...	126.05321389715223
backstairs influence by...	252.90596173181714
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	917.6854760636277
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	245.6205982031908
England is in the hands of the jews.	204.0774578220917
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	530.5295918920699
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	358.82696102499614
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	1219.654740919998
I have seen it coming these years.	428.26384056952946
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	1192.203199795179
Old England is dying.	676.7754096945818
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	826.9516097289002
He faced about and back again.	366.4346421364233
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	294.18804600527716
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	1005.4222477062066
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	1266.2254055957721
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	644.6523007856621
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	526.4427429411268
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	297.0040290858127
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	432.1373703530686
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	1872.6173326103842
Gabble of geese.	606.5503979842641
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	2267.9075795582803
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	920.3637266049113
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	1368.5864410536715
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	1436.3647647800192
Time surely would scatter all.	1238.6207263082827
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	1007.0471870172704
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	595.299940122292
— Who has not?	291.700991200511
Stephen said.	88.57131846105065
— What do you mean?	321.0503103636475
Mr Deasy asked.	295.8918092461596
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	371.2635089151624
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	2172.22861503711
Is this old wisdom?	840.6493434790432
He waits to hear from me.	325.3228484220911
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	455.0499165460581
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	651.350324296758
A whirring whistle: goal.	1117.717163874543
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	675.1875100121041
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	463.9386431679313
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	1148.478114294161
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	510.70596692532285
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	960.5129023965807
Mr Deasy asked.	295.8918092461596
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	395.52612661416157
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	850.6871438808278
Looking up again he set them free.	614.5105507010218
— I am happier than you are, he said.	291.89665457058123
We have committed many errors and many sins.	1439.7829877806369
A woman brought sin into the world.	477.49710434781707
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	849.5203771466297
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	878.7230729371371
A woman too brought Parnell low.	797.4403160440559
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	980.1080517090097
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	377.54195959899926
But I will fight for the right till the end.	350.4946700255216
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	1309.6486851767534
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	293.2974512214347
— Well, sir, he began.	168.62337733043864
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	514.3061832186223
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	341.86258449750983
Perhaps I am wrong.	504.9733555441687
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	372.9351867142417
And here what will you learn more?	601.1055285567222
Mr Deasy shook his head.	451.6904902918985
— Who knows?	349.5032711591078
he said.	56.271385512740096
To learn one must be humble.	915.0205469604276
But life is the great teacher.	464.5175057337948
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	563.798523945578
— As regards these, he began.	428.82755636613604
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	196.13959112754296
You have two copies there.	535.0638204795382
If you can have them published at once.	618.9947774052541
_ Telegraph.	242.55756258128054
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	341.48452518514586
I know two editors slightly.	749.3485434870869
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	432.0031984727154
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	733.4595402578714
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	377.81813154787227
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	535.7370606959762
What are they?	234.61884576542343
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	283.10215843856054
There is no time to lose.	350.79021499495695
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	495.49444526675535
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	295.2726574895404
Thank you.	172.3172505776897
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	439.1560228948134
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	306.85368009853
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	344.0397655571123
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	694.9611813157195
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	1179.561246829108
Still I will help him in his fight.	390.65109997784305
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	893.6458254171997
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	442.556357937158
No more letters, I hope.	310.599423952732
— Just one moment.	288.4785999315183
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	233.83745190188563
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	886.6254555119416
— I just wanted to say, he said.	176.29769165065937
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	492.9616421605077
Do you know that?	271.7036974529053
No. And do you know why?	330.3806825277884
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	627.1629928649768
— Why, sir?	191.90761987532792
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	315.8167052425033
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	475.9809418162427
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	530.0094725356522
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	617.9999708362855
That ’ s why.	159.93268875157557
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	1444.6095773633629
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	630.320523930017
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	860.8445726449999
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	1570.89952131871
Limits of the diaphane.	433.02820412836854
But he adds: in bodies.	438.5691569662526
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	585.5575197628775
How?	187.76888629280143
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	797.6016676445194
Go easy.	465.467945796758
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	2075.629501736027
Limit of the diaphane in.	338.18146122877846
Why in?	159.37845921613533
Diaphane, adiaphane.	619.7299894261303
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	459.45986315522777
Shut your eyes and see.	342.84520937529715
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	1289.2457999435499
You are walking through it howsomever.	720.4141008716573
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	839.6818574085293
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	398.50683435439134
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	517.9252014884665
Open your eyes.	394.0616246456985
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	947.137088011522
My ash sword hangs at my side.	1572.3127919329852
Tap with it: they do.	206.05618506457597
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	473.89959491295303
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	1621.0199281134358
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	2332.519260166822
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	753.8126820447554
Wild sea money.	808.6026411493851
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	810.7574352772269
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	717.742092586522
Rhythm begins, you see.	496.3206243014143
I hear.	99.77931384707202
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	2429.844307933209
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	821.5375974851029
Open your eyes now.	456.8639554168447
I will.	79.35156763903721
One moment.	258.35973552576525
Has all vanished since?	1355.1750291539643
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	419.56320289584073
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	422.858876936707
See now.	205.5437947742169
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	384.5771544406316
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	1449.9371081164136
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	582.5632770124976
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	1006.7036598275345
From the liberties, out for the day.	222.43092727094015
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	1814.1209182327705
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	1269.0094810488417
Creation from nothing.	547.4866673567228
What has she in the bag?	280.7782082519844
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	1731.5205146675175
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	1000.7022414356156
That is why mystic monks.	1128.8154208217886
Will you be as gods?	560.7775059489467
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	743.5302723611663
Hello.	143.78458929436798
Kinch here.	271.6884094512716
Put me on to Edenville.	467.5092311410499
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	505.3693824193946
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	2164.5179843963488
She had no navel.	441.55385994828623
Gaze.	287.5691785887357
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	1619.391380384168
Womb of sin.	455.9415175181755
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	794.2224984051406
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	375.3826292279518
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	701.721769492107
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	2459.414044999925
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	1578.0741112139126
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	1772.8860524865438
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	846.7806007017094
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	1832.6198190048844
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	1685.3893434512643
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	1918.1639229773768
They are coming, waves.	303.3171467909634

Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately?	1098.5662842790332

Couldn ’ t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?	673.4382981251844
And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	362.79911332296666
O, weeping God, the things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	713.0126198850509

A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.	1397.5981410274703

In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	1527.0755536522843
Cleanchested.	362.3144614049264
He has washed the upper moiety.	823.5865588242963

The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera.	381.23066453210936
Listen.	194.13978749570623
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	1372.4470010802645
This wind is sweeter.	813.5873544465869

Come out of them, Stephen.	142.53086369712813
Beauty is not there.	323.0526271603908
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh ’ s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.	1572.8563151874578
For whom?	518.6474162178321
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	1118.7938760645457

A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace (_descende! _), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	1063.423323436402
Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	1478.8871678645446
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	552.4122047711248
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	1380.153577302976
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek.	1039.809270357735
Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back.	319.17719241229764

You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose.	580.4222676364387
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street.	1101.447963146721
_O si, certo! _ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw.	1414.0267135432182
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women! _ What about that, eh?	867.1830317863449
What about what?	253.10415336826205
What else were they invented for?	716.405683939749
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	1956.445522639089
I was young.	103.05236513087921
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face.	844.7573911674923

Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	1394.825832327661

He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	879.3331371823936
Turn back.	330.7972949642207
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	1076.1403069443122
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	905.522087261289
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	1397.900701315769
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	1185.2008074102898
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	1110.5439322759041
Who to clear it?	337.0716186668719
He has the key.	203.8764494736929
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	506.7279079633355
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	882.0270416072191
Call: no answer.	430.67451743175656
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	542.2547019713376
Take all, keep all.	244.52748336137833
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	513.0843346485162
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	1027.2932994261116
The flood is following me.	462.993950823438
I can watch it flow past from here.	549.1957441940505
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	548.5866629104935
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	1098.096883438367
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	1626.523081019969
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	6566.473599866696
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	2233.224196050188
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	942.0874618676206
Hide gold there.	578.547944992343
Try it.	189.75676003282683
You have some.	183.98950229064923
Sands and stones.	518.7667125989217
Heavy of the past.	216.1404765522143
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	1017.116094176969
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	528.4061461266216
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	1093.6752420632977
Feefawfum.	362.3144614049264
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	3603.8269827642357
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	958.6493063077153
Lord, is he going to attack me?	352.54032750829197
Respect his liberty.	720.1435319225614
You will not be master of others or their slave.	599.6324223096119
I have my stick.	219.1915386034176
Sit tight.	618.6263682773916
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	1046.7582853105787
The two maries.	439.1841635024822
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	1304.8430573176117
Peekaboo.	362.3144614049264
I see you.	92.39636879643994
No, the dog.	107.91817229387858
He is running back to them.	229.59628452502625
Who?	186.88939383826636
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	2129.8389119214166
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	2124.216653339494
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	1786.2730836786898
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	1717.2611945294614
Famine, plague and slaughters.	924.6087671682415
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	568.1711059358175
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	734.314875337621
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	305.7965226086898
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	564.7790289527912
Dog of my enemy.	525.8239242502373
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	687.9628898681261
_Terribilia meditans_.	1694.178082865129
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	907.6630739334156
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	596.4063214105893
Pretenders: live their lives.	869.3238126161949
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	1098.8082947410032
All kings ’ sons.	573.6871139837059
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	548.1807984329209
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	849.5791029043253
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	1828.0725841417436
House of...	71.14807288760277
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	877.9947259366443
Would you do what he did?	410.85772408767684
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	517.5751752174724
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	286.897871278166
Would you or would you not?	369.73423906327446
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	902.1476255293908
They are waiting for him now.	310.33439450940205
The truth, spit it out.	299.69516932160565
I would want to.	138.4164653016788
I would try.	198.98543034108704
I am not a strong swimmer.	510.5752335662648
Water cold soft.	1011.5266713741868
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	499.7388118945296
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	366.4259031286306
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	1115.9614246087688
If I had land under my feet.	459.8808928101755
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	292.0964013776524
A drowning man.	354.37526792664886
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	519.7993152794392
I...	24.640350813017264
With him together down...	148.50244305976136
I could not save her.	240.8186250746519
Waters: bitter death: lost.	925.6998599809281
A woman and a man.	134.6836253303812
I see her skirties.	324.91412775090544
Pinned up, I bet.	373.4562969214915
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	1269.2300778495417
Looking for something lost in a past life.	462.57726411620024
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	1260.350345824027
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	1044.3521457250379
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	973.2611756068625
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	1023.0136385929284
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	1081.6511575175355
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	1644.4980277347818
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	977.9607534583458
Cocklepickers.	362.3144614049264
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	607.0943960054417
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	1345.2457624648011
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	1025.2682022264164
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	1244.6571592695166
The carcass lay on his path.	583.7903040847879
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	888.3461584828344
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	684.3217843588081
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	970.4935776716572
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	1212.9305218362094
He slunk back in a curve.	489.237271094379
Doesn ’ t see me.	292.399549162322
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	1042.864798688251
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	1389.7109545307603
The simple pleasures of the poor.	341.73398914686777
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	1714.855975837097
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	685.5653743384437
Wait.	118.6143906508203
Street of harlots.	507.26028076848337
Remember.	174.18262542580518
Haroun al Raschid.	2987.1211936978743
I am almosting it.	361.48333547649605
That man led me, spoke.	365.6177126138075
I was not afraid.	184.31600934575778
The melon he had he held against my face.	527.3465459231361
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	1356.8893541059335
That was the rule, said.	155.59292326850968
Red carpet spread.	1376.5078570947564
You will see who.	263.0837112231439
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	1275.4408660091583
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	2674.9862475122995
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	965.6880593750755
Spoils slung at her back.	763.2721776563723
About her windraw face hair trailed.	1988.7061501573048
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	1283.3028758371765
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	2226.735137505996
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	1391.517676596723
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	1792.6503333165776
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	736.0698465192502
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	2801.5173012954992
Couch a hogshead with me then.	634.0046480125792
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	684.3316765299571
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	6344.856869329435
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	2023.103598685523
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	2800.3520470663298
Language no whit worse than his.	1377.1995527557788
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	2857.9633876256303
Passing now.	367.3283205587948
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	569.9355014585502
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	821.7284200541218
I am not.	129.15967011349085
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	1257.167174291481
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	701.9504295088302
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	983.5280515289265
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	421.38985449346205
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	1013.4143772448534
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	640.4615358145486
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	5557.211438312415
Here.	114.12190415134765
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	395.8503750682382
My tablets.	617.9409086450424
Mouth to her kiss.	334.9600879855503
No. Must be two of em.	310.9703912928441
Glue em well.	1307.4496466652172
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	330.78980122816694
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	1402.8024564434752
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	1526.7934801055492
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	2876.3416244390364
Paper.	362.3144614049264
The banknotes, blast them.	489.7040647002252
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	368.4526321660669
Here.	114.12190415134765
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	551.2417474021787
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	676.3196200003214
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	631.4941613162596
Why not endless till the farthest star?	1789.2904886843692
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	900.2299110154282
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	1320.5254403655879
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	848.0666450373741
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	486.95686631559903
Who watches me here?	767.3735565916872
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	1748.2893289526392
Signs on a white field.	495.3338521725905
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	850.4977540485886
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	1270.9788565864562
Hold hard.	419.5064570953314
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	298.8868324674544
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	441.6287210437488
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	870.293618129401
Click does the trick.	685.5432189096766
You find my words dark.	499.0811529326619
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	767.6516503937545
Flutier.	362.3144614049264
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	640.1059408757222
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	519.4653045002278
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	888.6500472454867
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	1427.8439332126545
She, she, she.	82.53896268874149
What she?	174.11691874558096
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	974.8304514101932
Keen glance you gave her.	719.4755587209919
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	1397.6707337292203
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	706.4457292534855
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	801.7930202526792
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	2541.4517741216378
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	1936.0928820143358
Where are your wits?	772.6385103762376
Touch me.	247.44394906957208
Soft eyes.	321.3545379229454
Soft soft soft hand.	912.1356168750724
I am lonely here.	377.9985244063743
O, touch me soon, now.	250.77005829343807
What is that word known to all men?	421.3980361399603
I am quiet here alone.	519.4685230837033
Sad too.	282.4993486551768
Touch, touch me.	301.988137787194
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	899.552519759025
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	872.3345570587775
_Et vidit Deus.	3431.301201377522
Et erant valde bona_.	6355.6587579273155
Alo! _Bonjour_.	1135.3278902826794
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	2756.0864586239377
I am caught in this burning scene.	661.5510834633978
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	624.8271632201631
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	2916.8477348671686
Pain is far.	459.29343154892223
And no more turn aside and brood.	663.4015802170326
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	1025.5517674523371
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	1780.0990432667427
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	717.8307950584764
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	976.6131490453148
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	1446.4162754559507
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	482.1727222977099
He now will leave me.	319.06461325486845
And the blame?	270.5388381696504
As I am.	206.30545443102957
As I am.	206.30545443102957
All or not at all.	191.6104746634379
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	1746.4539909434916
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	542.5530779641829
Better get this job over quick.	817.8768358930884
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	1692.064208773389
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	1807.8672962412488
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	1363.9442889481595
And, spent, its speech ceases.	592.2969688576214
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	2658.518488124832
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	3263.922248164931
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	688.9461217826039
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	2230.1294227314206
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	1685.2094992413352
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	927.054026768846
Five fathoms out there.	678.705653421641
Full fathom five thy father lies.	2328.7382562971793
At one, he said.	130.83585844878877
Found drowned.	999.6444794885819
High water at Dublin bar.	724.6756762120522
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	1407.320845284758
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	1782.338391590916
There he is.	113.60129969024548
Hook it quick.	534.9767120053231
Pull.	266.9555776457352
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	992.9398161691564
We have him.	151.46136304503247
Easy now.	417.36555167088414
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	2721.283175590671
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	1256.1738272615721
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	6075.829169258924
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	2262.5192460108833
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	1635.9854725230978
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	959.8131386984941
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	804.8774028228596
Old Father Ocean.	906.8646680881848
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	2319.2281832888884
Just you give it a fair trial.	560.8684957395233
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	2114.5433521919877
Come.	101.86261728670831
I thirst.	194.70742516817262
Clouding over.	447.1901757082621
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	793.3567193109421
Thunderstorm.	362.3144614049264
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	1816.0078433949102
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	1969.1060862294457
Where?	201.5556843520298
To evening lands.	767.5073645624761
Evening will find itself.	942.911434815358
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	621.3211004432483
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	371.1186634486296
All days make their end.	547.9167511709479
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	602.1705874072313
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	1091.5371856606996
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	1213.0541204682354
_Già_.	316.5108355747976
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	440.0839497937482
_Già_.	316.5108355747976
My teeth are very bad.	650.2701616294635
Why, I wonder.	155.65178207721678
Feel.	189.40276820613508
That one is going too.	259.46370629464064
Shells.	362.3144614049264
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	356.56215737811937
That one.	115.6761007942385
This.	116.60358879185429
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	632.2129853583834
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	416.4628235256033
My handkerchief.	332.0103600368406
He threw it.	179.8947130883237
I remember.	118.65826995702753
Did I not take it up?	337.64287477353037
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	947.7975879671554
No, I didn ’ t.	151.01244147756583
Better buy one.	440.30123652662223
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	1014.7767018489919
For the rest let look who will.	464.67481656609533
Behind.	238.63253457126893
Perhaps there is someone.	458.79986812257204
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	621.3781500531029
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	1272.1421148819954
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	1200.6642436573727
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	3098.8132447694475
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	2274.0077843281706
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	1010.2392124042589
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	1100.4800546685478
Made him feel a bit peckish.	895.7034141769888
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	595.0139573586716
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	489.62095485228394
Right.	156.1165688701983
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	503.1929464960075
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	782.5703577566753
Cup of tea soon.	612.2446342869113
Good.	106.38652831975911
Mouth dry.	638.7159468670832
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	707.1038957736919
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	959.5776113478613
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	1230.8653928327246
Prr.	316.5108355747976
Scratch my head.	488.8350926179375
Prr.	316.5108355747976
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	1072.699428349269
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	671.8278410840232
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	254.76343772210657
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	277.659584839906
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	460.09109113280425
They call them stupid.	527.0496804381398
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	890.2869900292819
She understands all she wants to.	450.0720099451063
Vindictive too.	451.0719175306458
Cruel.	266.9555776457352
Her nature.	274.76064998269226
Curious mice never squeal.	2282.8029626024404
Seem to like it.	260.28317549402203
Wonder what I look like to her.	252.56883077429603
Height of a tower?	515.4702424260273
No, she can jump me.	329.0230912268912
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	373.53992740789374
Afraid of the chookchooks.	385.7842719765769
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	773.3778947637637
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	1280.971455409068
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	1512.7227898389565
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	806.4578299471646
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	549.2986941434267
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	1588.5933321624395
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	751.1641820199858
Why?	203.35538390318914
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	325.77525339797006
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	373.80428441772636
He listened to her licking lap.	697.4533133726177
Ham and eggs, no.	331.692945803264
No good eggs with this drouth.	702.5157245047352
Want pure fresh water.	1128.452867132108
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	701.2423987588281
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	603.5859774532756
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	668.3896440507957
While the kettle is boiling.	671.1620570026388
Why are their tongues so rough?	1188.3386426256054
To lap better, all porous holes.	1184.3278533927717
Nothing she can eat?	846.1854942445018
He glanced round him.	280.89338552715066
She might like something tasty.	664.3563278170186
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	684.5027487062557
Still perhaps: once in a way.	305.746472160847
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	367.57520753529894
Be back in a minute.	337.8025862978568
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	560.9749308469821
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	927.8414336233639
Must get those settled really.	982.8266633149508
Pity.	205.25706077185902
All the way from Gibraltar.	271.04643378181646
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	1027.9205271538979
Wonder what her father gave for it.	351.43326658230507
Old style.	450.6479108729887
Ah yes! of course.	257.9057094262402
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	493.20315950803564
Got a short knock.	547.2025328058196
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	662.0042625685635
Yes, sir.	114.45503538811168
At Plevna that was.	369.3876679000878
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	240.85535004145262
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	648.0213447373216
Now that was farseeing.	436.1133803990869
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	1569.816637049786
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	1795.867040182839
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	833.4473719200911
Course they do.	330.07506698020217
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	1023.6071592873676
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	1371.1806294201494
White slip of paper.	547.8990430615611
Quite safe.	671.5762100749604
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	608.7605489518311
In the trousers I left off.	261.970741145299
Must get it.	205.46892076874812
Potato I have.	276.1566573488928
Creaky wardrobe.	1530.8627101488164
No use disturbing her.	720.8530296611297
She turned over sleepily that time.	567.9507168777371
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	855.0366206596742
Looked shut.	731.6436317429623
All right till I come back anyhow.	565.4787549802769
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	946.8392100566925
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	563.8367367769808
Be a warm day I fancy.	529.0279549895188
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	901.827972995404
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	496.2769363117476
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	396.9870511935665
Make a picnic of it.	270.949195741606
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	1519.254581915945
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	3934.227171150845
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	878.7358458118916
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	444.70935613655905
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	1051.702070978616
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	747.599366127896
Wander through awned streets.	2612.7365029944513
Turbaned faces going by.	821.9709629503424
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	1607.7511004309838
Cries of sellers in the streets.	578.350640028065
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	1714.5441595303519
Dander along all day.	638.4649758412057
Might meet a robber or two.	681.5908379455306
Well, meet him.	191.82526386562895
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	833.9870467635777
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	397.1897415791594
I pass on.	135.6241112232332
Fading gold sky.	1337.8094104888298
A mother watches me from her doorway.	588.2053114176455
She calls her children home in their dark language.	669.7902594831208
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	1949.2029098340067
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	622.2495356386612
Strings.	362.3144614049264
Listen.	194.13978749570623
I pass.	126.43050771374885
Probably not a bit like it really.	447.3819484994971
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	363.30600370491476
Sunburst on the titlepage.	545.6873597630579
He smiled, pleasing himself.	433.2320484910581
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	1102.834322171607
He prolonged his pleased smile.	719.1606576666089
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	1068.3030485783147
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	540.2137240136634
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	1771.9609081363074
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	1436.3055997854592
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	438.931925680726
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	751.6608779932825
g.	266.9555776457352
as position.	189.8464583608917
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	1022.3239739825467
Baldhead over the blind.	449.4359959416347
Cute old codger.	1356.0047824865203
No use canvassing him for an ad.	779.4988514641154
Still he knows his own business best.	597.2490532388795
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	1238.3368005620423
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	676.6246550303252
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	381.0447713158495
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	220.21792628956103
Do you know what?	353.72572948154084
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	794.9964338315963
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	393.74897791306563
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	592.463992508987
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	869.0177997767912
— Good day to you.	171.05358507362862
— Lovely weather, sir.	363.3727704102995
— ’ Tis all that.	172.1266760917864
Where do they get the money?	391.92662929831346
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	1600.1502379457086
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	1524.0840454184315
Then think of the competition.	274.83341007551525
General thirst.	801.1273530133915
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	1503.2355847884116
Save it they can ’ t.	294.922220458129
Off the drunks perhaps.	682.4866738578029
Put down three and carry five.	760.904119738037
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	346.3653933040754
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	1210.3795693381553
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	460.66737733897804
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	546.9485839073154
Say ten barrels of stuff.	888.9279176355401
Say he got ten per cent off.	1131.028790732298
O more.	122.46449730571696
Fifteen.	238.63253457126893
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	843.8582972040813
Brats ’ clamour.	803.2268382001499
Windows open.	641.9831426939111
Fresh air helps memory.	2099.138975473793
Or a lilt.	359.66156936729516
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou.	17130.464709933487

Mine.	238.63253457126893
Slieve Bloom.	315.5194560244836
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	658.3318624278849
Fifteen multiplied by.	780.7899588249667
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	865.5812590550736
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	1809.1394010018178
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	1254.1428502156216
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	446.75266195459926
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	640.2606518210499
Chapped: washingsoda.	1030.48914156065
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	405.26147816700995
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	1117.4965041663136
Woods his name is.	346.87237308080523
Wonder what he does.	304.2405327830122
Wife is oldish.	834.2640890499362
New blood.	465.8000672679749
No followers allowed.	1211.5053461061686
Strong pair of arms.	557.2328102710982
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	735.0249633187553
She does whack it, by George.	433.9859110912652
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	1416.8574102601833
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	1323.65916326939
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	971.9416119927837
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	4328.037957180009
Moses Montefiore.	765.4313550744082
I thought he was.	114.2608290244401
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	1170.6224052904297
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	669.9766839689979
A young white heifer.	631.5679956816715
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	1273.5102824046514
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	921.4638799160933
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	1626.8079151603536
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	1470.4145967458296
— Now, my miss, he said.	165.1049285051521
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	1092.4258443718404
— Thank you, my miss.	238.10174795596933
And one shilling threepence change.	990.1366634069885
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	479.2138490095727
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	852.7541551975937
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	364.1638282769931
Hurry up, damn it.	303.7731132575361
Make hay while the sun shines.	1306.8899729539273
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	541.5264031288215
Sodachapped hands.	580.5966924991765
Crusted toenails too.	1290.9412518692384
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	2023.1611801760478
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	1704.9181735188422
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	1097.1368488840403
They like them sizeable.	517.9194789581012
Prime sausage.	1424.6282766826969
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	353.548643093561
— Threepence, please.	341.643828277628
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	1267.2962633860648
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	923.1084308461686
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	664.8613587738522
— Thank you, sir.	176.0296811548531
Another time.	287.8183757464116
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	1521.6787808160016
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	716.0322054348903
No: better not: another time.	326.35363597416733
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	261.1123371470926
— Good morning, sir.	217.1007258602056
No sign.	263.80497451368507
Gone.	189.40276820613508
What matter?	329.5879442888578
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	922.0858782417426
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	1159.4836816553563
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	4067.124649640456
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	898.5060608698446
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	2083.940114611135
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	1435.18881560962
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	5039.711536527702
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	540.9270585768004
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	558.3569936767727
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	1132.486070601475
Bleibtreustrasse <NUM>, Berlin, W.	492.884340307835
<NUM>.	51.43632622656843
Nothing doing.	450.6479108729887
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	552.4244764457112
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	1694.178082865129
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	1303.2319109431944
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	1462.0233182393026
I have a few left from Andrews.	415.53959070114996
Molly spitting them out.	507.1591271365309
Knows the taste of them now.	335.3326473619753
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	1909.4410361252612
Citrons too.	407.5894884528267
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	1083.656902233722
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	476.8435165077893
Pleasant evenings we had then.	904.1417076677328
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	561.4578235302007
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	557.546975579877
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	379.71406219582065
Always the same, year after year.	383.66184522476055
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	1255.9423993279386
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	1350.339867640803
Must be without a flaw, he said.	313.8148987624197
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	544.7883834695268
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	1880.2738379447264
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	246.0720515168692
How do you?	269.48556484120024
Doesn ’ t see.	278.2078777588473
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	597.2104585751533
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	485.5226315763629
Watering cart.	1163.2041170043808
To provoke the rain.	567.7955710173737
On earth as it is in heaven.	340.9464506112931
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	767.1524035058071
Grey.	266.9555776457352
Far.	194.13978749570623
No, not like that.	117.36280382345754
A barren land, bare waste.	1006.7138378567652
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	821.6469707417441
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	1907.5560663671272
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	1030.9975451742698
All dead names.	479.8174154161323
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	338.2616410008031
Old now.	209.7840424381927
It bore the oldest, the first race.	401.0674518576189
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	1039.5958178418407
The oldest people.	524.2278770319372
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	1021.5569629576568
It lay there now.	319.0057581069341
Now it could bear no more.	530.7479609293978
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	503.5124916183196
Desolation.	362.3144614049264
Grey horror seared his flesh.	1979.7543633487571
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	1221.5355089556417
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	1998.044746301818
Well, I am here now.	236.7970982972999
Yes, I am here now.	216.99994932693193
Morning mouth bad images.	1567.7958055038876
Got up wrong side of the bed.	387.61422229216026
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	1123.6143960394859
On the hands down.	197.80014036367837
Blotchy brown brick houses.	2720.6342707418726
Number eighty still unlet.	2766.5658745630312
Why is that?	201.33292507012766
Valuation is only twentyeight.	1106.301230859221
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	1820.6692160337248
Plasters on a sore eye.	659.1801523200178
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	809.2584945074946
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	2094.82498079535
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	1888.5555992738678
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	448.891252398636
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	556.7841889844007
He stooped and gathered them.	468.8557805297375
Mrs Marion Bloom.	330.5969431468478
His quickened heart slowed at once.	1490.2312541088415
Bold hand.	372.25859685894994
Mrs Marion.	295.07108041574463
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	1526.7956926415466
— Who are the letters for?	279.5624885095362
He looked at them.	186.05744195951652
Mullingar.	199.38933213025123
Milly.	133.47778882286758
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	262.9296774193639
And a letter for you.	156.17136771665247
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	806.7531078189429
— Do you want the blind up?	355.93678568417124
— That do?	217.4934011839964
he asked, turning.	154.03388183697578
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	497.223287995133
— She got the things, she said.	174.58259510851713
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	1157.6204150921112
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	258.65462833874005
I ’ m parched.	299.94285340629983
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	285.26354990948636
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	750.6336464183114
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	613.417406337234
— Scald the teapot.	434.334270486061
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	831.3982080721448
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	860.9633108520303
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	1106.975562584686
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	1364.3749044048805
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	835.1834933900864
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	827.4578956599321
Kosher.	266.9555776457352
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	1148.9168685772813
Pepper.	316.5108355747976
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	539.0241666328835
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	1956.1060111455442
The tea was drawn.	329.5861245456547
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	1188.05655524013
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	1027.388697520425
No, wait: four.	229.21273834688284
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	763.5314844755688
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	866.9992648414207
He smiled, pouring.	273.84248720398256
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	506.2432381518965
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	1130.4020697933074
Poor old professor Goodwin.	795.398706455693
Dreadful old case.	613.6970770365639
Still he was a courteous old chap.	478.48440351263247
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	962.3239443918487
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	313.80787808519824
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	512.3860365681539
Sex breaking out even then.	960.9160602606265
Pert little piece she was.	663.6328954480582
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	766.847870532477
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	1001.6352260545325
Everything on it?	340.39236025637234
Yes.	79.54417819042295
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	865.1863123201354
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	575.1484920090617
— What a time you were! she said.	186.60714759353124
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	1370.4741471784084
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	644.2144498225631
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	1793.994095124132
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	610.4578806261983
— Who was the letter from?	230.57413131879585
he asked.	89.54079260770219
Bold hand.	372.25859685894994
Marion.	152.1625388684635
— O, Boylan, she said.	128.30267642472577
He ’ s bringing the programme.	256.11539007091886
— What are you singing?	341.1911252281122
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	1449.246421875588
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	576.6952741596984
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	467.6439677548682
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	2100.727884310349
Like foul flowerwater.	1503.681303888897
— Would you like the window open a little?	387.52140945724955
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	598.0403674886709
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	234.02402669880004
I didn ’ t see the paper.	213.1720808821666
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	607.3456489238305
No?	156.6130365235901
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	1631.4280715699504
— No: that book.	177.65587291443828
Other stocking.	775.7355755804662
Her petticoat.	393.6729087043584
— It must have fell down, she said.	289.8528440556149
He felt here and there.	220.35679974882368
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	3873.9570626557393
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	951.1197137862109
Not in the bed.	136.43464688642499
Must have slid down.	511.7280542281437
He stooped and lifted the valance.	550.5323649003399
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	797.0522494787112
— Show here, she said.	212.81790806062168
I put a mark in it.	178.811337987212
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	264.8802003029154
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	1077.4383338506684
— Met him what?	398.1418495873008
he asked.	89.54079260770219
What does that mean?	425.16617482565664
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	1383.0485707562714
— Metempsychosis?	410.5719183217734
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	227.61778927811972
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	256.9487462134841
That means the transmigration of souls.	510.5125569309622
— O, rocks! she said.	183.33624604049237
Tell us in plain words.	551.5999470126443
The same young eyes.	277.085678171457
The first night after the charades.	365.3489316522323
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	394.90127999169925
He turned over the smudged pages.	579.2992984204484
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	528.818512001001
Hello.	143.78458929436798

Had to look the other way.	269.73886988145324
Mob gaping.	1106.2884715782523
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	947.0347916826536
Families of them.	257.63163886945927
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	1138.2907176714198
That we live after death.	532.2959318636455
Our souls.	391.689606790579
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	332.4072285427076
Dignam ’ s soul...	108.71592393073682
— Did you finish it?	427.2861051363827
he asked.	89.54079260770219
— Yes, she said.	112.07525180690587
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	306.6590844452058
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	297.8413726063504
— Never read it.	239.88727896368087
Do you want another?	525.1617954208945
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	736.5931392527198
Nice name he has.	325.246611233048
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	1012.7869810470758
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	1356.7318195643575
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	213.66135318459374
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	518.1074697758237
They call it reincarnation.	545.5116858083603
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	874.4604873596493
They say we have forgotten it.	421.53535811143337
Some say they remember their past lives.	899.3087802860705
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	3253.1386219831397
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	475.0072902538441
An example would be better.	633.4400289908403
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	435.13032098564287
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	2247.1965031187324
Tea before you put milk in.	524.8524916216995
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	756.0505099687615
Three and six I gave for the frame.	397.7636671249351
She said it would look nice over the bed.	366.54009009194215
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	781.0902794902801
He turned the pages back.	263.28506451353957
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	674.0221418823021
What they called nymphs, for example.	488.8508657957129
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	1029.6721563995263
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	1257.4673130595327
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	227.48539574586124
Did you leave anything on the fire?	539.3935494961379
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	396.9517872217101
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	1247.0648288186376
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	997.496753406589
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	830.5410118986699
Only a little burnt.	490.01465799626646
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	828.2755801264819
Cup of tea now.	397.2228166419152
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	543.6934797842672
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	1271.64666754671
Done to a turn.	267.58186520476323
A mouthful of tea.	434.7300332846028
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	521.8467842575546
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	487.4921299101729
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	618.7722399429167
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	1693.2933425848175
It suits me splendid.	723.1031335647543
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	935.7834373688061
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	815.2146401982088
They are lovely.	275.0418703235456
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	597.7876285259952
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	369.62564052190413
Will send when developed.	1102.3045079279293
We did great biz yesterday.	1248.8972353555234
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	321.9660794950207
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	1219.9909731398106
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	623.629669616152
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	412.84792982257625
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	567.9117259841703
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	1143.1727917087715
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	2079.9437575480188
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	1884.6305946023672
S.	90.57861535123159
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	1179.0968159712415
M.	92.54832975572836
Fifteen yesterday.	705.5229518945006
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	435.68396667659505
Her first birthday away from home.	790.5816328491892
Separation.	362.3144614049264
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	934.1665020178915
Jolly old woman.	475.3011448896136
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	778.5951284517668
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	676.9940935421747
Well, God is good, sir.	201.5365613373013
She knew at once.	310.3872490125139
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	459.08399202356304
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	1520.5326632830315
Excuse bad writing.	900.5663871434471
Hurry.	238.63253457126893
Piano downstairs.	1082.4834034118442
Coming out of her shell.	368.63584233783
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	771.4578587523972
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	804.6187790425867
Saucebox.	362.3144614049264
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	1013.3654640924165
Twelve and six a week.	460.1361031311557
Not much.	211.62387678505365
Still, she might do worse.	374.385164438749
Music hall stage.	1081.322229569036
Young student.	559.6148591681133
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	965.4481598471065
Then he read the letter again: twice.	383.0922473245239
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	404.01573796587456
But if not?	269.6883580969146
No, nothing has happened.	366.3236331652444
Wait in any case till it does.	499.9216693197458
A wild piece of goods.	609.3095366108935
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	967.7725385738576
Destiny.	316.5108355747976
Ripening now.	461.8909099399182
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	827.0104514111104
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	647.9214972274069
Anemic a little.	332.6971456995788
Was given milk too long.	802.8968737911949
Damned old tub pitching about.	2073.9894582128895
Not a bit funky.	541.2465435699626
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	809.1855536681054
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	1478.5764082279873
Seaside girls.	706.8553902220727
Torn envelope.	860.8673651095745
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	499.0527178967793
Friend of the family.	251.586476345116
Swurls, he says.	215.02463225175396
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	908.4643487595697
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	1050.483495784855
Milly too.	213.2987405307906
Young kisses: the first.	382.47548198980513
Far away now past.	607.7063333792556
Mrs Marion.	295.07108041574463
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	723.5792618468612
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	1113.949235066951
Will happen, yes.	401.10101571315664
Prevent.	362.3144614049264
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	538.6902267596383
Will happen too.	593.3508308689195
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	887.0269701860236
Useless to move now.	539.8349332359048
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	736.639544735924
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	765.1414934914873
Better where she is down there: away.	383.27885079378626
Occupy her.	318.0113883914681
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	349.91673256522944
Might take a trip down there.	640.6635746818382
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	1154.6980016628909
Six weeks off, however.	625.3769300922033
Might work a press pass.	774.636104726731
Or through M ’ Coy.	466.2381482620027
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	715.4093640417601
She looked back at him, mewing.	368.5171720823729
Wants to go out.	308.1424644487772
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	675.2766751923897
Let her wait.	286.11168171566015
Has the fidgets.	402.0237090275334
Electric.	316.5108355747976
Thunder in the air.	261.02326574182393
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	438.60441465675825
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	647.4363619434661
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	426.97510890908694
The cat mewed to him.	389.13948652336137
— Miaow! he said in answer.	319.0231482069816
Wait till I ’ m ready.	453.2329176570829
Heaviness: hot day coming.	823.8079236844469
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	730.7068337636558
A paper.	158.3161661447241
He liked to read at stool.	509.59203479045954
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	990.5692359001546
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	764.3071202110104
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	359.8829417523477
The cat went up in soft bounds.	663.9703882975798
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	449.45004018070244
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	412.8270658402448
Come.	101.86261728670831
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	665.6171012555949
No sound.	271.38602900568446
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	915.761318853839
The maid was in the garden.	241.69427243251064
Fine morning.	407.1638958411197
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	1095.1145500811542
Make a summerhouse here.	653.8466144285482
Scarlet runners.	1383.2906121420679
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	1052.366357045931
A coat of liver of sulphur.	552.1819582616288
All soil like that without dung.	769.7086163976161
Household slops.	1287.2969652097265
Loam, what is this that is?	347.27559124097024
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	1165.1298674458214
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	750.6818923037587
Mulch of dung.	593.9028288756907
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	1084.4828373996083
Dirty cleans.	1424.6282766826969
Ashes too.	407.5894884528267
Reclaim the whole place.	528.8409449946954
Grow peas in that corner there.	757.2084327820826
Lettuce.	362.3144614049264
Always have fresh greens then.	1166.9883175924085
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	1147.4879105614195
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	2030.8411527179308
He walked on.	145.55149668935476
Where is my hat, by the way?	238.13442470789457
Must have put it back on the peg.	396.7442407828525
Or hanging up on the floor.	385.2176604711295
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	375.39666962607356
Hallstand too full.	694.1294581128265
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	911.7685101132297
Picking up the letters.	390.61929639595337
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	1067.200352510068
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	501.38231890163195
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	1326.8882682287885
Just had a wash and brushup.	525.8625099280766
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	435.6237851858693
Tara street.	362.0444599276773
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	836.3674045533426
O ’ Brien.	229.33803551743134
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	1064.7399302610131
Agendath what is it?	357.53053649115344
Now, my miss.	222.71394175614586
Enthusiast.	362.3144614049264
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	614.6922602851259
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	823.2625911233608
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	516.7814343521063
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	1957.5888756460736
The king was in his countinghouse.	316.362140412281
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	987.2460750531428
Something new and easy.	438.83409828596973
No great hurry.	542.4751342220796
Keep it a bit.	220.32291723841217
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	1581.3057085786395
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	1281.4034179161965
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	749.0185466387358
Three and a half.	170.66486349961787
Three pounds three.	582.4028420885988
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	547.4228695566761
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	695.7257457208399
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	1793.993266465463
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	661.071912558347
No, just right.	174.0241756977921
So. Ah! Costive.	442.89239383200083
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	2210.357011117903
Life might be so.	415.7836680961916
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	695.9982959293194
Print anything now.	712.2848171889905
Silly season.	860.8673651095745
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	833.676397124733
Neat certainly.	822.5095190379086
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	1281.5988550094569
Begins and ends morally.	1327.8051627598995
_Hand in hand_.	841.2775306247186
Smart.	266.9555776457352
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	1038.8047082831604
Might manage a sketch.	1226.730501590716

Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	1120.9000102416958
Dislike dressing together.	1286.4475630897239
Nicked myself shaving.	1690.0323714136166
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	1330.4993675445926
Timing her.	318.0113883914681

I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	493.9416676828725
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	699.9522131798682
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	3241.1857941455087
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	1060.7986225763707
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	636.5048037052943
Washing her teeth.	573.7213508557537
That was the first night.	167.7920593630971
Her fansticks clicking.	1962.6546033588227
Is that Boylan well off?	567.684628484771
He has money.	208.20135752300627
Why?	203.35538390318914
No use humming then.	753.7062883734665
Allude to it.	225.73354762063906
Strange kind of music that last night.	560.6778686976759
The mirror was in shadow.	262.1294909678095
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	3056.8362008281433
Peering into it.	356.04567854684734
Lines in her eyes.	289.3212114795596
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	729.6243310990559
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	1043.0286095302029
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	1123.3574033664713
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	641.3579618531883
Still, true to life also.	337.7198729313014
Day: then the night.	233.6842939804111
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	989.8265412887781
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	797.0773681717
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	763.4498270140757
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	606.2107876606043
What time is the funeral?	289.917017920263
Better find out in the paper.	286.9031876474979
The bells of George ’ s church.	338.6108856725831
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	1052.756618410135
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	1257.6572635665354
There again: the overtone following through the air.	539.7763436159304
A third.	209.63019885749196
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	1905.879000134257
Could have given that address too.	686.7630132772848
And past the sailors ’ home.	343.1797735027799
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	718.5759411407823
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	1367.226749511332
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	1961.387271242223
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	625.291950257984
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	542.8324619520694
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	2536.9595356653317
Come home to ma, da.	593.540073947942
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	682.1111257796338
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	877.7222753670848
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	531.8370969010489
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	670.3686032403876
At eleven it is.	293.4992864548385
Time enough.	380.3241623202064
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	895.8108651726969
Corny.	138.24884141775306
Met her once in the park.	369.89328401762145
What a lark.	247.3496861496944
Police tout.	1082.4834034118442
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	1179.4183750067339
O, surely he bagged it.	361.21640534575937
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	766.6435492594043
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	536.3973580717419
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	1805.8529134224705
Rather warm.	537.0939500859125
Tea.	251.21481667538362
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	735.2172740642999
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	375.8221101842176
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	1235.205666086902
Very warm morning.	615.2512474771331
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	1899.7791777508598
Just there.	177.33636768889465
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	412.3359038016642
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	888.5983279033969
So warm.	295.6680308274015
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	731.9307928511167
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	789.4740476297668
The far east.	420.4965423319027
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	1176.0954504926594
Wonder is it like that.	188.080642656431
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	947.754798959322
Sleep six months out of twelve.	985.5343481439375
Too hot to quarrel.	751.9990830118544
Influence of the climate.	367.72350853333097
Lethargy.	316.5108355747976
Flowers of idleness.	713.3511991732846
The air feeds most.	716.6559451707457
Azotes.	362.3144614049264
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	1563.3310210939426
Sensitive plants.	1119.2297183362266
Waterlilies.	362.3144614049264
Petals too tired to.	625.7391912527286
Sleeping sickness in the air.	564.4787699050105
Walk on roseleaves.	755.7747821917408
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	1797.7562158123733
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	460.6781184326271
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	502.8697424361168
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	921.6648414504269
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	248.65328046755644
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	473.24736419073844
It ’ s a law something like that.	220.60507276117315
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	1909.9359065428046
The college curriculum.	734.9647902485804
Cracking curriculum.	1287.2969652097265
What is weight really when you say the weight?	656.4328308890911
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	1840.0886210931674
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	1416.5439907073312
They all fall to the ground.	263.3409540569023
The earth.	147.36896487149332
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	281.68000274254496
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	561.2029235099394
How did she walk with her sausages?	678.2208141234298
Like that something.	225.74701259419788
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	1162.6495329581317
Careless air: just drop in to see.	567.4898522161335
Per second per second.	1298.062736139035
Per second for every second it means.	936.1068844493891
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	722.065206187796
Too late box.	885.7558953695732
Post here.	417.94402229206287
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	534.5825738356656
— Are there any letters for me?	509.39569839991515
he asked.	89.54079260770219
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	1493.1004005754357
No answer probably.	513.4860601428679
Went too far last time.	784.9948921730663
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	700.1563948699013
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	889.5917631574324
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	2127.1499352080364
O.	56.514357636516635
Westland Row, City.	780.5767754341787
Answered anyhow.	811.4666184969553
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	1038.7323086652384
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	501.2538531026123
Castoff soldier.	1163.2041170043808
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	1526.0419036077426
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	171.08444115971582
Pointed cuffs.	1347.3302386213154
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	642.0999716220524
Redcoats.	362.3144614049264
Too showy.	868.194556509716
That must be why the women go after them.	444.8629248531014
Uniform.	316.5108355747976
Easier to enlist and drill.	1147.2017940788855
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	1148.7240504673093
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	1659.4030183988434
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	1272.696499617597
Mark time.	321.4325839609813
Table: able.	664.0410353207319
Bed: ed.	1030.48914156065
The King ’ s own.	227.77962496354334
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	771.5443432481406
A mason, yes.	293.74355821428776
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	278.0686864457241
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	873.0308933608403
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	733.8013579746412
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	573.0434812451683
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	584.0570462141288
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	929.4140286015224
No. M ’ Coy.	203.00270894123278
Get rid of him quickly.	531.8313451425731
Take me out of my way.	255.83509605987314
Hate company when you.	560.6355417978598
— Hello, Bloom.	131.75324358644588
Where are you off to?	267.81106683092077
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	261.7430002755947
Nowhere in particular.	559.7807676982374
— How ’ s the body?	186.34845537422146
— Fine.	190.47273645706701
How are you?	253.9399309763067
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	573.8706632823436
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	475.99556975295343
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	124.59485304768022
Poor Dignam, you know.	248.02107759143087
The funeral is today.	335.340476904046
— To be sure, poor fellow.	307.74417595365765
So it is.	133.76967736981953
What time?	214.90459920882347
A photo it isn ’ t.	386.7638442806266
A badge maybe.	844.7103527690135
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	171.8893255226765
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	323.2968710053819
Eleven, is it?	259.408234068826
I only heard it last night.	313.791483488536
Who was telling me?	390.78597076020446
Holohan.	266.9555776457352
You know Hoppy?	784.5624637657783
— I know.	89.721825817409
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	591.1596804382093
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	489.6335134943944
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	394.1113038856847
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	845.3802443632654
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	754.6833061241086
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	1196.1750840082732
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	814.1556723653703
Handsome is and handsome does.	596.7326157539296
Reserved about to yield.	812.0275105510179
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	797.1994650404354
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	541.3116218237049
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	408.6785281258025
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	407.79323702236786
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	524.8760265697629
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	489.1349930370386
In came Hoppy.	574.9880145107402
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	1568.641348145768
Clearly I can see today.	648.1046700261829
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	1626.1319725519431
Talking of one thing or another.	408.88130741168527
Lady ’ s hand.	207.3891719699788
Which side will she get up?	676.7926329030356
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	575.7093961365862
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	730.3288640366959
High brown boots with laces dangling.	1685.551884823715
Wellturned foot.	696.5335628819292
What is he foostering over that change for?	540.4762712073012
Sees me looking.	534.7515176404313
Eye out for other fellow always.	586.149264420188
Good fallback.	675.786925483352
Two strings to her bow.	601.6652279855717
— _Why? _ I said.	212.37250090603945
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	254.76450121830686
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	1005.0374692727306
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	138.4556051241054
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	324.90511204437223
Getting up in a minute.	381.19831873026254
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	770.0441775039559
He said.	69.96060248420643
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	302.2853133509198
And, faith, he filled up.	223.78249712452927
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	2096.1530802624866
I said.	56.182823120694586
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	295.9873703103672
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	560.0354232240073
_Yes, _ he said.	177.76759947421397
_He ’ s gone.	297.5138557168426
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	658.9179749118535
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	2289.8342302587894
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	3855.9332496982906
Lost it.	249.73394066126562
Curse your noisy pugnose.	2185.5392364610307
Feels locked out of it.	450.8919225839251
Paradise and the peri.	426.68645587725695
Always happening like that.	567.880441774473
The very moment.	228.5361176979411
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	1778.1117045098842
Her friend covering the display of.	631.3096641010765
_Esprit de corps_.	2150.853123533707
Well, what are you gaping at?	394.7381462720789
Another gone.	420.8978740649427
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	218.58811144458406
The tram passed.	344.806940227863
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	1372.432601651997
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	666.1928951189454
— Wife well, I suppose?	357.4431838067167
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	385.0844595093314
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	137.33544767680328
Tiptop, thanks.	366.89515184174564
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	1916.7055508961892
Incomplete.	287.5691785887357
With it an abode of bliss.	565.7560251800659
— My missus has just got an engagement.	1006.6771272041697
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	537.4675592945925
Valise tack again.	1275.9872511996916
By the way no harm.	348.7586090501381
I ’ m off that, thanks.	189.99545597073123
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	1269.4252371799173
— My wife too, he said.	185.0572422815459
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	638.0696698932659
— That so?	202.30768644307292
M ’ Coy said.	237.80277315961288
Glad to hear that, old man.	263.8454586932238
Who ’ s getting it up?	273.70266787575014
Mrs Marion Bloom.	330.5969431468478
Not up yet.	294.2466094302084
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	582.3469364560988
No book.	205.52709814967116
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	2892.4513892890723
Dark lady and fair man.	582.9228908641394
Letter.	266.9555776457352
Cat furry black ball.	2078.0993251004425
Torn strip of envelope.	1093.1568722318873
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	1027.8369468927692
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	272.238926443678
_Sweeeet song_.	1694.178082865129
There ’ s a committee formed.	436.52564810333274
Part shares and part profits.	1756.2306721778011
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	898.1883120385463
— O, well, he said.	100.3408452238645
That ’ s good news.	271.5123812375244
He moved to go.	213.2012617521551
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	306.9331978184222
Meet you knocking around.	1046.9514863277327
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	138.4556051241054
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	281.7909096222409
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	415.2208309630294
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	358.74210082023376
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	664.0566554468309
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	426.9739785808921
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	222.79204817370817
That ’ ll be all right.	235.87922398517816
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	475.14407913353926
Thanks, old man.	202.36866756227894
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	347.78361523935314
Well, tolloll.	329.6013183993847
Just C.	292.85628806565586
P.	117.25867887884843
M ’ Coy will do.	356.0011824424593
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	496.64401188695484
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	1099.4199137975986
The quick touch.	366.43866373871003
Soft mark.	684.6226168224619
I ’ d like my job.	251.55428689764213
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	569.6394089325457
Leather.	362.3144614049264
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	3760.9986742214064
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	925.6173371670293
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	640.9115100967829
My missus has just got an.	768.4681695624694
Reedy freckled soprano.	3634.516038318507
Cheeseparing nose.	717.9903969401971
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	503.3221204218974
No guts in it.	225.3358147691118
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	231.88912086749826
Softsoaping.	362.3144614049264
Give you the needle that would.	333.66722453904373
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	416.1782412875396
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	351.04762172011823
Against my grain somehow.	1696.1576825735713
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	1002.0571854392854
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	743.9358175362172
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	1044.9563726654542
Your wife and my wife.	340.44618130403893
Wonder is he pimping after me?	689.4150862903125
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	566.7323652127812
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	1473.0014741612224
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	1343.0705237585091
No, he ’ s going on straight.	187.84516292347035
Hello.	143.78458929436798
_Leah_ tonight.	723.9002813295522
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	1110.4168858559703
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	757.8973756523395
Male impersonator.	1383.2906121420679
Perhaps he was a woman.	204.75111763202946
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	2709.7227972344217
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	843.8995196885774
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	639.9513142256785
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	540.545245685607
And Ristori in Vienna.	715.7246498950917
What is this the right name is?	282.3230635332179
By Mosenthal it is.	424.36288381969763
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	669.6054169247338
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	465.0270013990931
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	573.3648191431134
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	427.65398577346673
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	554.3094761714574
No use thinking of it any more.	435.943175269452
Nosebag time.	468.15862401503944
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	698.8960303205273
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	1034.3702189964838
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	1277.2858947741845
Their Eldorado.	816.8947914426592
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	1536.2961132384198
Too full for words.	448.37598686544334
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	728.3966074009226
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	2014.2291373629284
Might be happy all the same that way.	386.70297010077593
Good poor brutes they look.	729.8653569648184
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	1450.694691225311
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	475.59901299692785
Might just walk into her here.	594.7430535060291
The lane is safer.	578.6257164848312
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	348.44258690631506
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	882.0287177060787
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	521.0043229827602
_Voglio e non_.	2378.3887330468906
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	712.3954249030159
Sociable.	362.3144614049264
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	1413.4201837038088
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	7343.134856126752
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	619.9457364029254
No - one.	203.50602773831434
Meade ’ s timberyard.	558.4747459627556
Piled balks.	1530.8627101488164
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	1915.8615799155125
Not a sinner.	329.1051242801557
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	1155.0795082647728
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	1284.9504128251124
Pity to disturb them.	537.1558860318974
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	688.0809104005431
Open it.	203.9069086915309
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	644.9623837707105
She liked mignonette.	884.5593335091734
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	287.55401489527196
And Mr?	171.90113979023542
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	435.6561587135398
A flower.	204.1805990510772
I think it ’ s a.	99.62110361120814
Not annoyed then?	969.6341498221278
What does she say?	416.0993998401065
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	606.2029900914599
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	534.6948774651736
Why did you enclose the stamps?	844.6163020888663
I am awfully angry with you.	440.0836024370322
I do wish I could punish you for that.	369.4690618392181
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	525.7214489748012
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	626.4474291600136
I do wish I could do something for you.	337.60874539031425
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	451.1445206210806
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	294.9266104770841
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	752.2662971856854
I think of you so often you have no idea.	341.62761334172217
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	450.4501364217719
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	552.0327900817417
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	506.5930313758403
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	406.1156994693369
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	1385.2771579659252
Then I will tell you all.	252.675230868948
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	720.4709384854269
today.	114.72255681559355
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	1834.1326878524712
S.	90.57861535123159
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	874.7121317042514
I want to know.	140.9775259975349
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	1242.1995899572307
They like it because no - one can hear.	469.7854925103368
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	860.2730845769524
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	582.5471544865604
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	3094.9367715240965
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	436.9803910879803
Weak joy opened his lips.	1128.6532081852297
Changed since the first letter.	650.125719525501
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	581.4997100950485
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	680.9597769455802
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	970.3386908955057
Thank you: not having any.	373.040340229233
Usual love scrimmage.	1569.937128786722
Then running round corners.	857.4225483257147
Bad as a row with Molly.	432.0420201689978
Cigar has a cooling effect.	1261.896254276217
Narcotic.	362.3144614049264
Go further next time.	930.7730628568823
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	549.5455262176929
Brutal, why not?	529.8690437652997
A bit at a time.	184.50875459734226
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	422.76925911900827
Common pin, eh?	1129.0736062680996
He threw it on the road.	223.72071622535123
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	812.1394871274282
Queer the number of pins they always have.	549.4795501750928
No roses without thorns.	1227.736956562646
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	1089.582161042393
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	611.5201173305146
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	462.4442214060119
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	430.1211547343032
It?	149.20884249083326
Them.	287.5691785887357
Such a bad headache.	748.9947863669481
Has her roses probably.	838.6422946205922
Or sitting all day typing.	977.247908486114
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	1704.0529472720045
What perfume does your wife use.	851.8754924055476
Now could you make out a thing like that?	390.81584734984466
To keep it up.	257.00808789450974
Martha, Mary.	233.3929462651222
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	934.8378034451312
He is sitting in their house, talking.	270.0405211365271
Mysterious.	316.5108355747976
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	673.6787203695378
To keep it up.	257.00808789450974
Nice kind of evening feeling.	670.6718303879381
No more wandering about.	456.1332262109376
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	1921.4751840310018
Forget.	266.9555776457352
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	845.0766945075961
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	568.5486878331488
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	912.6877798932885
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	857.619600573546
Tell her: more and more: all.	222.7840647805399
Then a sigh: silence.	392.55840219959003
Long long long rest.	651.0470063763089
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	972.2782256150228
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	909.2063087341407
Henry Flower.	402.3035794214783
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	548.7604316675514
Simple bit of paper.	499.10762007805124
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	1284.9296400046746
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	387.7836699807907
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	779.4644523362117
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	3249.405546935696
A million pounds, wait a moment.	489.559370678034
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	734.7203910269388
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	666.0187133239796
Yes, exactly.	189.1054967379244
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	857.4877938538398
What am I saying barrels?	723.2784034243167
Gallons.	362.3144614049264
About a million barrels all the same.	579.2299038986101
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	2780.4497991257426
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	2020.3279121257528
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	2514.6127845289907
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	788.2269844536995
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	838.4342724477699
Damn it.	182.58309266552905
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	574.1847803527927
Same notice on the door.	379.10821025954476

Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	948.6553442177508
Prefer an ounce of opium.	1444.1732480249989
Celestials.	362.3144614049264
Rank heresy for them.	978.5235134086267
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	748.2185572034658
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	678.8860122287429
Not like Ecce Homo.	1557.6597822446804
Crown of thorns and cross.	638.4412764657038
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	1457.4119923484614
Chopsticks?	775.6872792440565
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	757.190963562809
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	1022.1639130550205
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	777.620329986105
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	716.8954139513786
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	741.2974032342107
Still life.	231.26554645872682
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	392.9380908343829
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	714.9816730807881
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	990.1864801232022
Something going on: some sodality.	636.9821350417574
Pity so empty.	631.0057327936644
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	971.0740208545958
Who is my neighbour?	516.9697010628599
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	577.1477740644565
That woman at midnight mass.	694.6506543653629
Seventh heaven.	682.3593705921436
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	1725.9504371853595
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	809.1188585302489
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	387.43235659567137
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	527.1455243410153
Her hat and head sank.	479.6272053798887
Then the next one.	194.59669924013667
Her hat sank at once.	664.307533013848
Then the next one: a small old woman.	340.80005912823657
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	420.98369769270494
Latin.	194.13978749570623
The next one.	192.6289586681804
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	556.1668792164634
What?	128.2987952047132
_Corpus: _ body.	383.40251671757875
Corpse.	287.5691785887357
Good idea the Latin.	418.9886753454883
Stupefies them first.	522.5674927889767
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	675.3041295524246
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	1023.5503039691528
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	491.26794091804584
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	944.7771057854784
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	697.9159388417297
These pots we have to wear.	914.2785596949269
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	1030.2523509421935
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	711.1833398546781
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	915.9129066453461
Look at them.	207.4602033241044
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	855.5838314218553
Lollipop.	362.3144614049264
It does.	188.9515766495441
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	284.3822900815552
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	438.3413617397498
Hokypoky penny a lump.	978.8223545252908
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	460.5330814187306
They do.	141.19853334200675
I ’ m sure of that.	142.5011358191612
Not so lonely.	429.01875280846997
In our confraternity.	593.0691214204444
Then come out a bit spreeish.	591.5722079240737
Let off steam.	590.213143405685
Thing is if you really believe in it.	475.3752240433169
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	1043.7226946223175
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	1297.3377559226708
Hence those snores.	1386.9925683413255
Blind faith.	757.6594718553403
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	417.42713393679696
Lulls all pain.	797.6247828502186
Wake this time next year.	943.0013959697399
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	804.6244736209787
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	265.00470936293567
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	236.02557729463484
Bald spot behind.	802.6259571546631
Letters on his back: <URL>	497.4910609212677
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	292.8340204952299
And the other one?	176.18094864560277
Iron nails ran in.	882.0448393494119
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	920.591313712121
Do not deny my request.	935.8143605143302
Dusk and the light behind her.	310.8927276470109
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	453.25264713822673
Their character.	426.1698138763635
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	560.6158566820519
This very church.	454.6702722618289
Peter Carey, yes.	470.3444095370468
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	506.2634314518615
Denis Carey.	753.9178292569198
And just imagine that.	304.25557814421
Wife and six children at home.	626.9297567080121
And plotting that murder all the time.	450.49305924635524
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	458.41237728031956
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	633.2053024458238
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	175.60108024688677
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	413.9673109748084
Yes: under the bridge.	217.83114535849262
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	971.251247360768
Wine.	238.63253457126893
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	1922.7051172133758
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	536.3380233914571
Cold comfort.	875.8445868638984
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	1555.604054225449
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	304.6047848355218
Quite right.	307.78566494436416
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	435.37168996073945
Not going to be any music.	394.0649628557481
Pity.	205.25706077185902
Who has the organ here I wonder?	576.5975748093163
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	973.7746737204185
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	641.5226759562737
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	1095.6441423432248
Christ or Pilate?	1009.6636561587012
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	413.9702247208283
Music they wanted.	469.6280258453434
Footdrill stopped.	860.8673651095745
Could hear a pin drop.	868.0561414519483
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	475.18368003087824
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	651.7611123908182
Mercadante: seven last words.	796.696249557002
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	786.1977547543378
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	994.6676618676379
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	681.2288010013974
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	1376.2316000390824
Benedictine.	362.3144614049264
Green Chartreuse.	930.2740099866628
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	618.2714742317199
What kind of voice is it?	276.7108553050697
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	1239.8272156885866
Connoisseurs.	362.3144614049264
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	640.1139095970996
Kind of a placid.	404.3338388475619
No worry.	461.0968707140225
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	531.5483122367592
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	530.9992190204474
Who knows?	430.2340849984916
One way out of it.	171.8294002486887
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	527.5740065231105
All crossed themselves and stood up.	516.300408074601
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	547.3528105582722
Stand up at the gospel of course.	386.3824628641239
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	718.979694328146
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	429.60240485487395
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	477.81308191726515
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	380.10882985572323
English.	154.08885144978342
Throw them the bone.	452.0646285046671
I remember slightly.	324.7951492734702
How long since your last mass?	1081.6031566819483

No browbeating him.	437.70787703144714
He had his answer pat for everything.	581.9086350974094
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	516.7318280440107
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	837.8137018654628
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	996.5486282338841
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	442.2216664620165
All over.	147.06208714824552
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	856.6938635116887
Brother Buzz.	952.7063482268222
Come around with the plate perhaps.	495.9238023192247
Pay your Easter duty.	1498.043135546023
He stood up.	171.6207836117261
Hello.	143.78458929436798
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	714.0286169544129
Women enjoy it.	489.3906342690286
Never tell you.	264.6420548441873
But we.	146.15163311310067
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	479.6456071769324
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	1173.9799307085464
Glimpses of the moon.	280.05226116301185
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	420.62926708309953
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	391.9584458387727
Still like you better untidy.	657.4401989540013
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	860.0292979795678
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	602.9050103585312
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	1507.134211796139
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	647.1654920729301
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	646.546275918795
He covered himself.	301.00179529495193
How goes the time?	336.1202613294018
Quarter past.	539.8413233446234
Time enough yet.	648.8986477820329
Better get that lotion made up.	612.3253494106274
Ah yes, the last time.	213.0038780349968
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	512.5425606839439

He walked southward along Westland row.	1596.2017592765542
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	286.33593856076044
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	293.8765530603466
Bore this funeral affair.	1503.5942352029438
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	241.77929454808006
When was it I got it made up last?	398.81195730966556
Wait.	118.6143906508203
I changed a sovereign I remember.	393.9178953037156
First of the month it must have been or the second.	346.73151386528855
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	306.9175782236894

— About a fortnight ago, sir?	599.7407833445492
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	138.4556051241054
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	1151.3754981735935
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	1146.7827283148872
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	595.3544409841016
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	1248.9979588855447
— And white wax also, he said.	304.77229019973936
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	327.37089366679

Feel fresh then all the day.	407.29893805706905
Funeral be rather glum.	1419.5289562028158
That was two and nine.	226.41885925461898
Have you brought a bottle?	561.1858190971676
— No, Mr Bloom said.	134.17372695700502
Make it up, please.	271.63474702030163
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	401.0684722409152
— Fourpence, sir.	256.157582582077
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	457.9394043816762
Sweet lemony wax.	1962.6546033588193
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	175.15131625094224
That makes three and a penny.	367.03680648101664
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	180.61348962767715
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	398.5331496751546
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	154.40625199201745
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	592.1253304957338
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	543.0126518186472
What ’ s the best news?	290.89469885605257
Is that today ’ s?	269.5377983282461
Show us a minute.	481.5038769478275
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	1600.0910072461352
He does look balmy.	603.6924168275846
Younger than I am.	554.8259572858994
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	1716.6443896278465
Wants a wash too.	504.5163537517359
Take off the rough dirt.	797.1671386226682
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	816.296422666769
Dandruff on his shoulders.	478.44173172916686
Scalp wants oiling.	2336.319969302567
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	504.56251705067575
Where the bugger is it?	323.6916770320664
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	1143.3021629432205
Barber ’ s itch.	597.5194991843035
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	694.7920591771029
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	377.75402024148013
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	237.2605619166408
— Ascot.	231.97356209944272
Gold cup.	450.7890250004658
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	945.4628553328777
Half a mo.	496.2357353437473
Maximum the second.	325.07701895721374
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	259.27409847809065
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	1869.9353146743817
— What ’ s that?	126.48086317101261
his sharp voice said.	276.8254646151799
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	285.6845697355643
I was going to throw it away that moment.	301.47788228396445
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	1204.3679662386185
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	179.2129656028531
Here, thanks.	220.34336579322394
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	800.0491158400112
God speed scut.	1278.2678506567781
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	555.4527653920773
Silly lips of that chap.	407.242149541155
Betting.	316.5108355747976
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	1511.909793059557

Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	2603.4215097398746
Keeps a hotel now.	522.7127405305487
They never come back.	331.7063541109438
Fleshpots of Egypt.	534.1037283894951
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	755.4699248952566
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	759.3796184464867
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	1210.308570014606
Damn bad ad.	815.3396690397931
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	491.2889856171611
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	725.1399656971515
Something to catch the eye.	315.2093959626575
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	503.99756336372263
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	431.834790028555
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	460.51776170067444
How do you do, sir?	294.0253021567404
Heavenly weather really.	1498.272238101191
If life was always like that.	295.89575922348035
Cricket weather.	978.1341721973465
Sit around under sunshades.	1463.0719785844428
Over after over.	352.4323482492371
Out.	154.08885144978342
They can ’ t play it here.	343.1601495191112
Duck for six wickets.	1516.4163363305884
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	1448.9675765714146
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	682.1352118462914
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	905.9844177750966
Heatwave.	362.3144614049264
Won ’ t last.	333.7544949838478
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	586.5247645554545
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	1440.0783807791017
This is my body.	318.54612538988766
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	1222.1286814148286
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	1404.1410078923416
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	647.0681556831377
— Come on, Simon.	171.9380513353551
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	168.01497069700682
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	402.3631922825158
— Are we all here now?	443.97545576123906
Martin Cunningham asked.	385.84479444114146
Come along, Bloom.	183.4653725254808
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	444.9725720588568
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	687.1948934228104
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	967.6694610081729
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	1256.7948931970066
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	639.4128537275463
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	576.2954362873829
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	940.4811070444465
Job seems to suit them.	862.5977043420538
Huggermugger in corners.	691.4257400480573
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	938.4889237799662
Then getting it ready.	468.4848726533758
Laying it out.	316.3924527346298
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	567.6410812398306
Pull it more to your side.	409.81932727899044
Our windingsheet.	619.3156466369926
Never know who will touch you dead.	646.1269235366723
Wash and shampoo.	852.7237329271148
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	357.5140794253523
Keep a bit in an envelope.	393.1578478702279
Grows all the same after.	365.8559853562026
Unclean job.	777.8814759553394
All waited.	313.305147609107
Nothing was said.	195.9169625947366
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	683.632528910619
I am sitting on something hard.	446.01363067931106
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	425.0232701272615
Better shift it out of that.	273.7063103147088
Wait for an opportunity.	446.28472017403965
All waited.	313.305147609107
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	803.7685906196548
A jolt.	363.0901552219435
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	899.5692984334233
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	2036.9415940400447
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	1197.7240289501938
At walking pace.	698.5309217175313
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	864.2365246509221
Tritonville road.	637.1131338661779
Quicker.	316.5108355747976
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	1924.218744787424
— What way is he taking us?	373.100028087802
Mr Power asked through both windows.	763.7580849309098
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	349.5711231835067
Ringsend.	238.63253457126893
Brunswick street.	376.2691424531939
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	341.6187436203189
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	234.1204093012214
I am glad to see it has not died out.	427.3022378115579
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	1912.6449505506953
Respect.	287.5691785887357
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	1542.5050925173296
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	672.4203142591601
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	231.47205237250913
— Who is that?	184.2183921885544
— Your son and heir.	418.85756822227773
— Where is he?	185.61907060057595
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	470.5373187916402
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	1377.2077604646342
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	628.9580659049285
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	525.5890116383108
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	719.2459156906641
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	1228.9024774631987
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	1902.2691717179123
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	585.1987004256914
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	550.3464794194606
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	966.1430350554185
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	1025.864110930403
Out on the rampage all night.	445.8270834970148
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	370.07253087996105
Wife ironing his back.	667.7602616672993
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	685.8521564356757
All breadcrumbs they are.	564.72386701944
About six hundred per cent profit.	3311.3507728650466
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	404.05245110915627
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	1600.8432142138822
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	585.837483349772
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	422.78891742959064
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	648.3417223369474
A counterjumper ’ s son.	373.72174272147754
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	1220.3899205314842
Not likely.	410.01469228482193
He ceased.	210.80115405887184
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	737.422223536667
Noisy selfwilled man.	1363.3098344228001
Full of his son.	229.91719665951547
He is right.	129.6005370934864
Something to hand on.	200.49614878477374
If little Rudy had lived.	833.7221068577838
See him grow up.	411.9658646277706
Hear his voice in the house.	252.45603978916452
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	1481.1828950273118
My son.	233.5597098868667
Me in his eyes.	189.15442366335265
Strange feeling it would be.	521.252805045443
From me.	152.12560840744888
Just a chance.	283.36500441751167
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	652.7294148767594
And the sergeant grinning up.	494.0809053690898
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	766.1468473798516
Give us a touch, Poldy.	391.1642050787199
God, I ’ m dying for it.	195.01803449205372
How life begins.	537.7776724090478
Got big then.	398.2667784435218
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	1081.8721085388104
My son inside her.	428.1231246252829
I could have helped him on in life.	288.97553092172296
I could.	79.55812444302136
Make him independent.	587.0404287538602
Learn German too.	1027.8659382649046
— Are we late?	553.0092227680697
Mr Power asked.	269.8404443766768
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	466.75717625631546
Molly.	110.76341078027173
Milly.	133.47778882286758
Same thing watered down.	1054.489892619244
Her tomboy oaths.	1506.737591928115
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	919.8948796429917
Soon be a woman.	323.24175105836264
Mullingar.	199.38933213025123
Dearest Papli.	1163.2041170043808
Young student.	559.6148591681133
Yes, yes: a woman too.	191.5149165472552
Life, life.	199.05694686167197
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	996.3317696459676
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	840.2166067479837
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	432.86241518896145
Do you follow me?	499.80010403953656
He closed his left eye.	362.2583198796284
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	1335.2137459593723
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	148.16041536984636
Crumbs?	677.625253892059
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	963.4415524187478
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	1595.807212600297
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	882.4543118363429
What do you think, Martin?	311.28004870348303
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	388.0048883257246
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	438.54068088372594
Glad I took that bath.	512.7175917953988
Feel my feet quite clean.	972.1084085870796
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	1778.0324550802281
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	922.5123011526736
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	187.90635296536448
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	911.4437448539305
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	675.7174943386618
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	198.7530360391874
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	341.6395590097718
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	633.9363635706826
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	355.0276401229964
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	348.96082414830437
He said he ’ d try to come.	249.82503064146425
The carriage halted short.	653.1759850548642
— What ’ s wrong?	228.3522138783788
— We ’ re stopped.	309.65252667140595
— Where are we?	320.8691606709042
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	222.59563965029238
— The grand canal, he said.	261.1163994249626
Whooping cough they say it cures.	1451.3279595032889
Good job Milly never got it.	691.8646697317662
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	973.8812172516269
Shame really.	629.3891230016147
Only measles.	834.3472305783472
Flaxseed tea.	723.9002813295522
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	1662.4748665028098
Canvassing for death.	533.9777394273823
Don ’ t miss this chance.	546.7860450071079
Dogs ’ home over there.	424.1741576519749
Thy will be done.	583.5784715125075
We obey them in the grave.	383.1577088676888
A dying scrawl.	720.5449608864603
He took it to heart, pined away.	366.92675983174684
Quiet brute.	952.7063482268222
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	699.3232451676507
A raindrop spat on his hat.	732.1464538711008
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	1403.3637018783365
Apart.	362.3144614049264
Curious.	219.45635629992586
Like through a colander.	554.3730501316846
I thought it would.	161.81728766381653
My boots were creaking I remember now.	755.3434942470877
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	404.23243560066305
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	515.2464937872894
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	290.3647064574708
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	262.6655678835972
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	968.5836746347325
— We ’ re off again.	278.84085643265536
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	1865.5074562099303
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	450.15565230924375
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	526.9351090631911
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	330.8063536341446
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	801.40019826535
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	765.3695098873393
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	774.4046231874579
And the retrospective arrangement.	437.7332172791628
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	871.463847619714
Martin Cunningham asked.	385.84479444114146
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	193.98385183153275
Where is it?	204.9191401255316
— In the paper this morning.	259.00332572953414
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	398.3358316242513
That book I must change for her.	370.18837905778827
Later on please.	562.5961881868976
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	780.2273608859581
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	393.271570471049
no, Sexton, Urbright.	419.04391863356705
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	2917.8532017881903
Thanks to the Little Flower.	429.0545611407967
Sadly missed.	952.7063482268222
To the inexpressible grief of his.	367.2921427469403
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	1063.5255296007758
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	699.044377599634
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	1693.964740841067
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	1446.4723626328412
I tore up the envelope?	427.24074915447073
Yes.	79.54417819042295
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	438.97165350069884
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	707.1897592045088
There all right.	198.33794663548878
Dear Henry fled.	1337.8094104888298
Before my patience are exhausted.	1308.8045024419503
National school.	586.2367042406115
Meade ’ s yard.	422.51008976441074
The hazard.	293.5798015336128
Only two there now.	345.95261043043445
Nodding.	362.3144614049264
Full as a tick.	550.8652135535655
Too much bone in their skulls.	892.6828660318398
The other trotting round with a fare.	535.6723681816371
An hour ago I was passing there.	571.2685227015844
The jarvies raised their hats.	897.3836158886088
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	1320.0990664463584
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	1673.7255031434504
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	772.2028018256959
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	1007.3759962925438
Antient concert rooms.	1795.3569458695877
Nothing on there.	225.65318496364642
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	841.2959038214946
Not much grief there.	541.7596982350915
Quarter mourning.	773.6189512842986
People in law perhaps.	528.7818539775899
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	721.1694451052589
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	2271.79631061379
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	573.5169734967045
I said I.	65.48614938598455
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	853.3808968604073
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	4315.792369178237
Big powerful change.	1068.2025764006212
Wet bright bills for next week.	1669.9955775232709
_Fun on the Bristol_.	583.8381059733211
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	587.7909096188894
Have to stand a drink or two.	428.79617277040916
As broad as it ’ s long.	318.0411006311
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	173.14445532684792
Her songs.	439.64983108572426
Plasto ’ s.	192.26784247426903
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	3139.0561374704894
Who was he?	168.6507904259432
— How do you do?	299.833914715981
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	601.8791046172063
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	309.9170076065867
Yes, he does.	131.2664357920388
How do you do?	335.7026113949049
— Who?	177.54062056318844
Mr Dedalus asked.	223.16591218670712
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	323.36588475722476
There he is airing his quiff.	677.6830118481221
Just that moment I was thinking.	338.141150851428
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	688.7793720615132
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	1094.2944718320607
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	380.0495568287836
The nails, yes.	214.58238206474303
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	539.8800629393678
Fascination.	362.3144614049264
Worst man in Dublin.	394.5190261489164
That keeps him alive.	625.923740608657
They sometimes feel what a person is.	483.70312060437766
Instinct.	287.5691785887357
But a type like that.	248.7732217696163
My nails.	373.40629168008365
I am just looking at them: well pared.	585.6297197953774
And after: thinking alone.	394.73410078038654
Body getting a bit softy.	1113.487217061981
I would notice that: from remembering.	396.1214331185724
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	836.502244102064
But the shape is there.	222.55525378503552
The shape is there still.	347.435635932526
Shoulders.	362.3144614049264
Hips.	362.3144614049264
Plump.	362.3144614049264
Night of the dance dressing.	450.3428272046703
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	1082.958876833146
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	815.7011263107595
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	530.2180529971517
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	172.58924372064791
I hear great accounts of it.	339.02019031743697
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	128.82498299975447
— Are you going yourself?	518.4939523855229
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	182.78558377431315
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	657.6718881769589
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	600.2817201650587
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	333.3105524451994
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	340.0593263235483
Mary Anderson is up there now.	556.7095908082745
Have you good artists?	948.9125772248603
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	627.1529028713106
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	399.78931433319644
J.	78.32022695006061
C.	105.94139119590463
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	573.9958721541059
The best, in fact.	167.1115472832816
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	474.8580291061566
Last but not least.	500.8049479876547
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	784.3568212913866
Smith O ’ Brien.	561.6709179401261
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	766.8074322612686
Woman.	168.1714758313536
Must be his deathday.	480.8926423144706
For many happy returns.	1099.8845632732468
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	1220.403259565532
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	636.1036985982332
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	588.6968457912619
Had his office in Hume street.	692.9028123815839
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	1000.8724396773022
Has that silk hat ever since.	826.8796897542079
Relics of old decency.	732.284235014521
Mourning too.	407.5894884528267
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	1649.2675855283705
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	459.32171560818483
Twenty past eleven.	804.1427206695756
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	414.00797608887603
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	2334.187533701071
No: _vorrei e non_.	1564.6339613633886
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	649.9352495020005
_Mi trema un poco il_.	8992.997819664071
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	997.9286059565102
A thrush.	337.893462741676
A throstle.	337.893462741676
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	587.991386509295
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	790.5146081340906
Greyish over the ears.	473.2794144821177
_Madame_: smiling.	542.4108637227663
I smiled back.	194.1262686140305
A smile goes a long way.	440.27823143206757
Only politeness perhaps.	1012.8454850743602
Nice fellow.	324.0083927573015
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	578.4093427909845
Not pleasant for the wife.	305.26563192570734
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	400.265607489981
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	957.5053439356216
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	679.9831074033317
What is this she was?	235.44979364349783
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	464.36291510376276
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	823.7453154272183
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	1110.5717875014757
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	237.24266338820485
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	1040.427734649812
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	442.38906191688795
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	862.2501915740485
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	522.7856508679887
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	314.6013790764049
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	488.1725589459071
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	831.697139185445
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	414.2506882096781
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	574.2184646593724
— What is that?	152.63423309223882
Mr Dedalus asked.	223.16591218670712
I didn ’ t hear it.	212.61352260894168
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	295.6374877111983
— What?	133.89864297395368
Mr Dedalus asked.	223.16591218670712
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	1259.4726740502244
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	202.98031261635066
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	987.1861948477007
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	820.6846269038296
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	92.36337925276953
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	957.9272609947669
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	623.9058148037228
Is he dead?	342.0564914853224
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	595.8278447724541
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	634.4020657228829
Half the town was there.	294.53282188238495
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	138.4556051241054
But the funny part is.....	114.69670660967746
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	587.6093181115205
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	725.4933811711983
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	298.2263496196925
Like a hero.	293.78356473734254
A silver florin.	590.3065020220942
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	495.4570607120132
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	307.14495775796945
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	561.8459128124472
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	747.8552854881884
Nelson ’ s pillar.	342.89336154077955
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	885.0369519492518
Mr Dedalus sighed.	371.92618230594223
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	608.9121713770982
Many a good one he told himself.	403.7871149191114
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	593.4041978865872
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	591.7220421369511
He ’ s gone from us.	195.485061042605
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	496.75455111760715
He went very suddenly.	376.3206049838135
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	388.626711877393
Heart.	185.09665951145675
He tapped his chest sadly.	896.186336349087
Blazing face: redhot.	983.8009233700282
Too much John Barleycorn.	1160.5942476045525
Cure for a red nose.	534.3730669837618
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	1068.4848448889668
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	699.3372066252215
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	1241.110854255483
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	248.69698585394056
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	230.4581653666194
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	690.9394745973974
— No suffering, he said.	192.1522278299958
A moment and all is over.	197.9753737896685
Like dying in sleep.	476.29933747555475
No - one spoke.	383.5176326676215
Dead side of the street this.	272.9116807493733
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	1395.0620063908666
Why?	203.35538390318914
Some reason.	432.1316787637471
Sun or wind.	562.2352358255328
At night too.	290.8537266750787
Chummies and slaveys.	786.3033004403247
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	792.3402865110052

Breakdown.	316.5108355747976
Heart.	185.09665951145675
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	1925.0004947908128
A tiny coffin flashed by.	920.274409818351
In a hurry to bury.	424.47407104084783
A mourning coach.	628.6285633395041
Unmarried.	362.3144614049264
Black for the married.	244.19829247384027
Piebald for bachelors.	920.2204281834507
Dun for a nun.	440.60967701520303
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	323.54141899390584
A child.	173.15609734274634
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	525.0730350653342
Dwarf ’ s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	965.2397317829779
Burial friendly society pays.	3046.1520672942597
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	682.5773175857129

Meant nothing.	673.6651193106577
Mistake of nature.	362.5258608170206
If it ’ s healthy it ’ s from the mother.	234.66870056803066
If not from the man.	167.8794545806023
Better luck next time.	743.3748761474363
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	300.2753372842399
It ’ s well out of it.	141.90474944618475
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	1153.540861835802
Rattle his bones.	562.1539224887131
Over the stones.	304.6769979514944
Only a pauper.	398.34904919107635
Nobody owns.	1082.4834034118442
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	317.4017989281716
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	300.61398993875605
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	817.2714739869989
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	461.61321594882656
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	733.9708654884919
We must take a charitable view of it.	579.244172556274
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	366.18508951814607
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	358.563125532411
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	295.86077576948253
Looking away now.	420.17294050880025
Sympathetic human man he is.	477.01960302707135
Intelligent.	362.3144614049264
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	303.0543212289912
Always a good word to say.	337.4747700429631
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	633.3778519607976
Refuse christian burial.	2293.22458800812
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	610.7059192596481
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	1496.5202238265053
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	1430.978785611109
He looked at me.	176.97519435441382
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	328.9137697524421
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	1012.0056757358457
Leading him the life of the damned.	276.57513090334805
Monday morning.	365.17850143034633
Start afresh.	1530.8627101488164
Shoulder to the wheel.	400.9371651631525
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	390.96815854760786
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	583.6180014044479
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	720.7463660196418
He looked away from me.	257.4046362030135
He knows.	143.060259730211
Rattle his bones.	562.1539224887131
That afternoon of the inquest.	400.91316421204306
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	517.9065443776057
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	557.4999886229548
Stuffy it was.	266.2022946937702
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	904.6843310161663
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	759.120597322396
Boots giving evidence.	1624.8339477899397
Thought he was asleep first.	513.9240937524813
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	684.9332327738282
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	330.496920148334
Verdict: overdose.	950.2221901290908
Death by misadventure.	841.9873758965994
The letter.	143.02981707335883
For my son Leopold.	444.88847297177387
No more pain.	402.4823872190262
Wake no more.	477.6283787178071
Nobody owns.	1082.4834034118442
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	2112.2543409388295
Over the stones.	304.6769979514944
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	321.74464296933076
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	265.7594307609632
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	732.0205203577582
The Gordon Bennett.	646.705423292492
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	247.25023856075796
That will be worth seeing, faith.	579.7884846441689
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	1367.2688337159161
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	2257.2013370231634
Kay ee double ell wy.	5974.858492965591
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	720.623300103301
He left me on my ownio.	425.13349169812744
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	1827.3620347293488
Eccles street.	310.13485520047044
My house down there.	311.0067961461173
Big place.	341.8493247986744
Ward for incurables there.	682.5398336044727
Deadhouse handy underneath.	2856.740820768762
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	914.5962164722503
They look terrible the women.	411.64297346750243
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	855.1694614593989
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	418.58565859194755
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	942.1100432029231
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	380.47386234618665
From one extreme to the other.	297.70610594787166
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	796.8219610274917
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	2372.379752746721
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	2017.842220231771
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	326.9475250872208
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	924.7257122318599
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	280.29171673731156
Tomorrow is killing day.	975.6938626592232
Springers.	362.3144614049264
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	2086.7571839569628
For Liverpool probably.	858.9466444359575
Roastbeef for old England.	707.2853029940221
They buy up all the juicy ones.	655.5029563332262
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	694.3841921858526
Comes to a big thing in a year.	327.00212082958274
Dead meat trade.	1186.2434756314228
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	906.3268015528758
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	2043.0941933508316
The carriage moved on through the drove.	458.3683902080175
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	499.36240707079315
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	842.0754574181815
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	628.616072259124
Quite right.	307.78566494436416
They ought to.	181.71183748867148
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	719.8740189818341
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	379.2493960250311
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	247.8784620663361
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	2072.0122722041137
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	640.1353795709745
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	272.9232791184549
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	1485.2162403848733
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	253.56028707679826
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	607.1076823674465
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	422.450928638499
Gordon Bennett cup.	1244.6377072194387
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	755.1715848376587
Bom! Upset.	1135.3278902826794
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	393.0390710459471
Burst open.	580.0972540219625
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	818.5875189240481
Red face: grey now.	472.35415088256184
Mouth fallen open.	972.9264047899716
Asking what ’ s up now.	318.68285399786635
Quite right to close it.	391.8659301838949
Looks horrid open.	1094.2951921608344
Then the insides decompose quickly.	1044.0311875052448
Much better to close up all the orifices.	769.3274307551856
Yes, also.	143.3151671119249
With wax.	360.08915284009584
The sphincter loose.	702.8854144118902
Seal up all.	338.4885976659847
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	509.41509749296665
Dunphy ’ s corner.	319.23267701672535
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	1822.5827289854994
A pause by the wayside.	548.3261447511943
Tiptop position for a pub.	775.6963292575472
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	633.6151975341564
Pass round the consolation.	584.0401261497304
But suppose now it did happen.	550.2809602360448
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	908.111883001661
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	187.09520038759055
Depends on where.	394.67257583578885
The circulation stops.	657.1415445885308
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	1040.337586100341
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	492.0124389823693
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	1614.4853576907744
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	1371.745096278001
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	947.7894598096892
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	1994.382927754341
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	968.9272214514474
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	803.6391800971985
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	546.8371350861374
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	2685.1047812019206
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	722.2014770120193
Or cycle down.	632.6845680760415
Hire some old crock, safety.	1281.9524842724804
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	391.52849913848365
Developing waterways.	1530.8627101488164
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	1108.185406286502
Cheaper transit.	1347.3302386213154
By easy stages.	1205.6096630539855
Houseboats.	362.3144614049264
Camping out.	373.1314248823749
Also hearses.	840.5974593301141
To heaven by water.	418.1217139488748
Perhaps I will without writing.	618.6618372187695
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	580.1324712655776
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	1098.0267848908436
With turf from the midland bogs.	1193.0492058036507
Salute.	287.5691785887357
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	1024.2320472717643
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	1507.9564586834001
Near it now.	254.30129880109524
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	631.267730664851
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	565.1883551846677
— How is that?	184.65134484777047
Martin Cunningham said.	266.08842608504045
Left him weeping, I suppose?	639.738159495104
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	417.4864113648567
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	1402.9312911421114
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	337.7953266141917
Last lap.	624.9720843531308
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	1085.8323302860908
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	870.4770443478326
In white silence: appealing.	726.9754894991922
The best obtainable.	525.0381249140671
Thos.	362.3144614049264
H.	146.9113160121431
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	1843.541854808301
Passed.	362.3144614049264
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	1298.4305761594233
After life ’ s journey.	430.66811292310047
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	1026.0252803773901
Mr Power pointed.	437.86229383123305
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	374.54031780391296
The last house.	210.93804688087616
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	184.41489261486936
A gruesome case.	564.1833412133556
Seymour Bushe got him off.	778.5910062520474
Murdered his brother.	506.67965439829595
Or so they said.	225.78601949370267
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	405.5399328578486
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	800.4851770163388
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	191.12266960764018
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	1985.524322379634
They looked.	189.96450989996828
Murderer ’ s ground.	370.83359750176334
It passed darkly.	638.1071072195473
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	1322.613644296777
Whole place gone to hell.	778.8091836310319
Wrongfully condemned.	1347.3302386213154
Murder.	266.9555776457352
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	316.9389332261261
They love reading about it.	387.07903747315083
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	374.1505516095908
Her clothing consisted of.	775.5857341892371
Recent outrage.	1287.2969652097265
Murderer is still at large.	618.9398544193282
Clues.	362.3144614049264
A shoelace.	401.82531000530776
The body to be exhumed.	419.9058159695155
Murder will out.	392.0520283294789
Cramped in this carriage.	577.7476512706667
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	549.3061963970955
Must be careful about women.	670.613889830001
Catch them once with their pants down.	830.6733658288259
Never forgive you after.	512.4941676052737
Fifteen.	238.63253457126893
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	1541.6673290917547
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	1559.8086700967222
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	2135.440093595746
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	1232.414386151449
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	626.1171832631686
He stepped out.	231.3514736364428
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	362.0520438747138
Change that soap now.	611.4291875984608
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	1251.1713536375007
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	553.4559053837075
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	1431.0690109304976
It ’ s all the same.	128.09632043696936
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	1481.9088591788106
Pomp of death.	395.87007689430914
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	1267.0742770559355
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	857.5829755470053
Dogbiscuits.	362.3144614049264
Who ate them?	559.2342344841185
Mourners coming out.	526.172878664064
He followed his companions.	394.205644794062
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	729.7409203989536
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	841.9456230462982
He handed one to the boy.	216.87607155554844
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	527.8127454912218
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	2647.795647693025
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	1074.7874090976231
Coffin now.	461.8909099399182
Got here before us, dead as he is.	354.26140548578707
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	978.3355927139985
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	1026.7013685077984
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	874.4723565379664
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	1802.391981625332
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	861.91362055221
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	1080.4260436713994
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	1245.9214538588542
Too many in the world.	261.5362449920452
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	492.3081288419755
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	1220.9947428030202
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	512.1257968466474
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	670.935824661606
So much dead weight.	712.2005983025862
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	1376.9193049328237
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	323.0400295142214
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	617.3378242554381
Who is that beside them?	381.83604094612036
Ah, the brother - in - law.	303.62661427261384
All walked after.	299.58417817181993
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	736.987241345546
— What?	133.89864297395368
Mr Power whispered.	432.5853028443309
How so?	261.0287189242828
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	783.9885941388995
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	473.0307580656307
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	416.0083781663521
Anniversary.	362.3144614049264
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	433.36328581327814
First I heard of it.	190.46539356639758
Poisoned himself?	943.5388059565959
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	753.1852071878616
Speaking.	287.5691785887357
— Was he insured?	583.3022365870719
Mr Bloom asked.	169.48270452529925
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	318.96512296518614
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	853.807816716095
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	810.7378168601608
— How many children did he leave?	706.6902824187858
— Five.	173.44069168047335
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	374.36442945372636
Five young children.	611.713540474778
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	470.95823282170903
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	490.22719344834525
Has the laugh at him now.	306.7257320008896
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	520.8898387088325
She had outlived him.	389.45647052984765
Lost her husband.	533.473944683686
More dead for her than for me.	357.3505577744231
One must outlive the other.	544.5184629884376
Wise men say.	590.213143405685
There are more women than men in the world.	410.12816296241704
Condole with her.	274.9455368291767
Your terrible loss.	1152.432960196712
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	448.75484494858426
For Hindu widows only.	1607.8473507099811
She would marry another.	584.9657746660498
Him?	380.0846763753652
No. Yet who knows after.	395.4012625372667
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	692.9162417995391
Drawn on a guncarriage.	671.7293891888336
Victoria and Albert.	467.22206535723416
Frogmore memorial mourning.	2418.3840695598783
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	486.2675986527679
Vain in her heart of hearts.	459.0436515710737
All for a shadow.	199.5057503673878
Consort not even a king.	600.8171303202059
Her son was the substance.	359.83399671156747
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	484.4397304925034
It never comes.	321.65535530787736
— How are you, Simon?	265.53219603108795
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	797.8138427526749
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	579.2591991509566
— Never better.	264.21967055298364
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	530.9333888034132
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	687.464337567189
Same old six and eightpence.	681.8135118673173
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	1417.7045404446126
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	426.6017554332299
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	675.2376244164356
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	685.1739939103384
Dick Tivy bald?	2906.5844048902413
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	619.9300916619321
A few bob a skull.	549.689210572894
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	728.6475128413156
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	315.1160406114522
Is that the eldest boy in front?	581.3544796155173
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	232.49159356621678
John Henry Menton is behind.	576.0000629710986
He put down his name for a quid.	290.4280746060466
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	290.6878490844677
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	658.0429634250578
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	294.3268260200017
— How did he lose it?	386.6654038769545
Ned Lambert asked.	453.2625973325186
Liquor, what?	374.36147251151397
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	366.6990191554248
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	502.79369815700704
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	1098.8415296564601
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	508.18014891818933
Both unconscious.	875.8445868638984
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	503.7924823086283
All he might have done.	332.25821330743946
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	686.2086553738444
Would he understand?	549.9362443043988
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	738.4701896571261
Which end is his head?	516.226798815608
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	460.178540935383
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	1553.8206117449388
Always in front of us.	302.0828130707648
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	968.8565825204013
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	762.6703378247773
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	911.5122419759006
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	948.094497463645
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	697.8845287289952
Who ’ ll read the book?	369.42660512314706
I, said the rook.	139.44594249311368
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	640.0259502125467
Father Coffey.	499.82223974429087
I knew his name was like a coffin.	261.5883368642182
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	840.1788253188603
Bosses the show.	376.8911376152712
Muscular christian.	1023.7495956619516
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	1665.4583838033986
Thou art Peter.	1019.7953343579346
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	979.3530072373895
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	606.6824837113431
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	1963.2796445711272
Hhhn: burst sideways.	1099.3818927622885
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	2293.243285411282
Requiem mass.	883.8439977967795
Crape weepers.	1530.8627101488164
Blackedged notepaper.	1347.3302386213154
Your name on the altarlist.	446.14016154573216
Chilly place this.	656.6966239526674
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	659.6743273281817
Eyes of a toad too.	442.61381286609236
What swells him up that way?	464.27742640445365
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	1698.2160287006218
Air of the place maybe.	481.4378083034472
Looks full up of bad gas.	730.7874857272217
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	895.2297899886705
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	930.6302567765912
Who was telling me?	390.78597076020446
Mervyn Browne.	1383.2906121420679
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	967.8789434824964
Out it rushes: blue.	533.359858769897
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	392.8620593078882
My kneecap is hurting me.	1151.5696872380224
Ow. That ’ s better.	235.11634628359386
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	395.93112256111885
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	343.0778991161001
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	283.0167421429218
As you were before you rested.	482.21159533796106
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	246.58347156914922
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	1689.867070431156
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	594.1457268754112
Up to fifteen or so.	452.6224045244879
After that, of course...	82.18510984742214
Holy water that was, I expect.	324.2211875803132
Shaking sleep out of it.	357.49697553542165
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	673.2797585594762
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	470.93617577264035
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	1620.3804128711727
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	532.7378204241521
On Dignam now.	346.76020215727044
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	576.4115401208337
Says that over everybody.	645.2041714852704
Tiresome kind of a job.	423.73551429453335
But he has to say something.	253.2573104378404
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	507.97985119230725
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	729.4782725117428
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	540.4452848384649
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	639.6317704278124
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	698.4645248470044
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	715.9107783122543
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	1745.5995317755373
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	839.249747762895
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	511.410071635694
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	340.36361588840595
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	565.8704224088248
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	199.35393999985106
But his heart is buried in Rome.	518.0025330841421
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	752.6421163037896
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	498.9029001401196
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	1228.9025159259836
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	612.1489421057845
Mr Power took his arm.	396.9750212762734
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	267.309763259061
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	381.28313670208905
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	337.2435794211763
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	1321.2033488090538
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	1154.8881446044932
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	721.5728959107273
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	480.35661709138594
I suppose we can do so too.	373.2137200465175
We are the last.	172.78320220650866
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	942.1956444371763
They covered their heads.	596.8200945893386
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	581.7180786918066
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	850.8821053471133
Mason, I think: not sure.	338.8043627571884
Beside him again.	356.81644537627244
We are the last.	172.78320220650866
In the same boat.	291.1308808203923
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	529.9090570096504
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	1045.0424644132422
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	973.4075762674913
The language of course was another thing.	346.76348047124685
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	737.3414161101541
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	604.0283058747267
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	191.23278842898495
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	759.8546725867959
No touching that.	258.89327204275986
Seat of the affections.	397.6869979128136
Broken heart.	572.8536707183919
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	962.681047915693
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	609.8542060318223
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	1059.1444153465497
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	1170.3992281009807
The resurrection and the life.	223.57973440745306
Once you are dead you are dead.	502.05371852678843
That last day idea.	432.50188863150373
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	546.1480387321816
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	648.2293668490211
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	856.842420561363
Find damn all of himself that morning.	508.6353035996082
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	625.5663772428854
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	2467.3478756292743
Troy measure.	709.5585194267692
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	1038.3109349219824
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	483.43084642437833
What?	128.2987952047132
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	456.86313634579784
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	368.67108738265114
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	813.8669193510905
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	303.0918470880682
— What?	133.89864297395368
Corny Kelleher said.	377.1715517955936
Mr Kernan assured him.	502.96311981077434
John Henry Menton asked.	623.7779033401143
I know his face.	138.33215665912135
Ned Lambert glanced back.	740.6998126771614
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	266.17051692452395
She ’ s his wife.	139.4095438296964
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	278.0206862974712
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	357.9146977319658
She was a finelooking woman.	349.0961069207885
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	902.0882483587278
And a good armful she was.	329.89103464979837
He looked behind through the others.	336.5266641205607
— What is he?	148.09362284269272
he asked.	89.54079260770219
What does he do?	314.84842568611396
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	602.698983950385
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	442.9721270429849
Ned Lambert smiled.	606.3934841363321
A traveller for blottingpaper.	610.2984162168841
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	530.5854207052728
She had plenty of game in her then.	389.42322636328925
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	425.4991219152249
He does some canvassing for ads.	819.6826792242081
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	1034.379346540205
The barrow turned into a side lane.	675.2811573614963
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	897.7603156672756
The gravediggers touched their caps.	984.3794319479916
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	427.118718677673
He never forgets a friend.	452.55223180576996
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	551.2158899191314
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	474.834248513324
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	495.37231825457746
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	392.9796776081603
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	1126.3024220277523
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	417.77232297165796
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	220.22052296726457
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	1102.5279493428666
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	1137.5603760114739
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	521.4310746473211
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	606.4192799201577
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	887.9954522282624
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	887.6524012270031
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	778.0010083309886
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	656.9099924467621
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	549.7865769475501
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	869.9654662294156
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	1030.6384122740953
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	462.4312230560556
— I know, Hynes said.	159.52176184629022
I know that.	88.95354636999582
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	427.8153452412489
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	650.1568901198806
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	777.9516506045405
All want to be on good terms with him.	355.9946380694025
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	673.5864312846593
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	755.8105661251893
No passout checks.	1509.2096931540596
_Habeas corpus_.	1694.178082865129
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	380.098431613327
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	1120.1709073558347
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	508.31974357989776
Be the better of a shave.	292.32078385321785
Grey sprouting beard.	2147.4006930108694
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	432.0769587832939
And temper getting cross.	958.4334743903579
Silver threads among the grey.	1093.995053465003
Fancy being his wife.	506.7852046576795
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	599.1135825288486
Come out and live in the graveyard.	325.6727261479078
Dangle that before her.	371.3465670574438
It might thrill her first.	565.7555050357544
Courting death.	682.3593705921436
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	807.2171894398399
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	1003.5966877836998
Will o ’ the wisp.	508.8510212299657
Gas of graves.	629.0760356114653
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	520.190923769149
Women especially are so touchy.	1366.8503110600734
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	555.3949872314939
Have you ever seen a ghost?	665.8543595374215
Well, I have.	107.18960597039643
It was a pitchdark night.	373.9389388472943
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	363.94737759819435
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	991.4549789674726
Learn anything if taken young.	1021.8321952980194
You might pick up a young widow here.	673.112749133859
Men like that.	261.6489022962263
Love among the tombstones.	663.4320885980848
Romeo.	316.5108355747976
Spice of pleasure.	476.7504843854911
In the midst of death we are in life.	373.1181416273572
Both ends meet.	1030.1119338996964
Tantalising for the poor dead.	415.19572361503384
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	993.8824669898521
Gnawing their vitals.	1167.0944675372755
Desire to grig people.	1140.8980841211023
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	363.1633741034928
Eight children he has anyway.	938.579178443232
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	845.9363757593708
Holy fields.	633.9668000180056
More room if they buried them standing.	979.8866527537064
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	678.7598379612837
Standing?	677.625253892059
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	861.0051472873968
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	1315.4916399951078
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	4431.206355036998
Well, so it is.	131.91135280044506
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	438.5530917953286
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	4065.5897939317274
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	1018.8641582579361
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	472.49417540385485
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	1133.76390749991
Every man his price.	496.77547892989094
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	1614.8231334345646
A bargain.	262.3895991473631
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	1699.2972796232377
With thanks.	321.61506066459395
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	822.5927096232366
Charnelhouses.	362.3144614049264
Dreadful.	287.5691785887357
Turning green and pink decomposing.	1422.1401547695755
Rot quick in damp earth.	1307.3182376313116
The lean old ones tougher.	1341.8645091985577
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	472.3650889149537
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	812.1579210731148
Then dried up.	458.7469066972326
Deathmoths.	362.3144614049264
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	839.4406191620791
Changing about.	358.275043994483
Live for ever practically.	839.9393565292715
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	717.2632999910562
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	665.0049833114231
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	1044.9450505138948
Your head it simply swurls.	915.6608488180143
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	2236.7211511485757
He looks cheerful enough over it.	693.7371041672741
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	724.6375834145936
Wonder how he looks at life.	523.6086901639159
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	846.152120575494
The one about the bulletin.	284.9377737978217
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	572.2613669758928
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	253.8304220027554
Not arrived yet.	969.0937855112376
Peter.	156.1165688701983
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	581.4723880719982
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	911.5050605543469
Keep out the damp.	349.2827365393735
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	657.582561632138
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	587.9075528137407
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	719.8690903824499
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	689.6940428591926
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	11616.330304063953
Go out of mourning first.	396.8680275042132
Hard to imagine his funeral.	551.5680687768589
Seems a sort of a joke.	379.79096995294987
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	1756.3943955047341
Gives you second wind.	709.2685700438623
New lease of life.	608.5448757383577
— How many have you for tomorrow?	487.2603897554585
the caretaker asked.	217.7975661102058
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	332.352912209221
Half ten and eleven.	518.5612261215352
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	393.8128129925162
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	961.2552347956882
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	744.9180270653643
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	853.2896285787308
Burying him.	273.9821162966245
We come to bury Cæsar.	878.4698381186519
His ides of March or June.	1042.875979089233
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	587.6210690120008
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	979.8235917428494
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	304.83122238477995
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	391.4821598839004
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	900.3004173642798
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	558.7244981725203
Yes, he could.	108.59371275919133
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	781.0072115379025
We all do.	180.2127563136942
Only man buries.	730.326460656252
No, ants too.	330.7745386887347
First thing strikes anybody.	1305.9213713967836
Bury the dead.	308.63516902133705
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	1111.1635814373722
Well then Friday buried him.	723.3860721357346
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	812.66425662857
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	968.6338156176679
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	571.7831318710033
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	585.1687108863638
All gnawed through.	631.2581856581396
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	806.8033340644057
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	530.0303761680813
They ’ re so particular.	376.65438171546896
Lay me in my native earth.	697.4377844799308
Bit of clay from the holy land.	569.7589337202962
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	746.6290393649368
I see what it means.	232.1157684782001
I see.	74.968645537024
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	570.8504787536797
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	345.33047706672795
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	994.4842629745389
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	476.4022154697626
Twelve.	238.63253457126893
I ’ m thirteen.	249.75736828944693
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	360.11899910051756
Death ’ s number.	326.5980127078042
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	539.8832093269755
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	296.4684985433741
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	1230.4888179136356
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	1231.158311726975
Tinge of purple.	534.1037283894951
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	560.554029706726
Dressy fellow he was once.	505.3745454302768
Used to change three suits in the day.	603.3290287984659
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	923.8259242456901
Hello.	143.78458929436798
It ’ s dyed.	252.4959168962077
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	719.3931709445566
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	922.0294335910671
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	422.30900975156743
Twenty.	211.88278239180926
Pause.	362.3144614049264
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	890.358909269424
Far away a donkey brayed.	1514.828610699959
Rain.	287.5691785887357
No such ass.	529.3758771103215
Never see a dead one, they say.	286.671206303875
Shame of death.	329.5829022327833
They hide.	304.04635450072925
Also poor papa went away.	1005.9630643472243
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	1437.3237805338401
Whisper.	251.21481667538362
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	990.6357727139925
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	1138.5193612285834
Wellcut frockcoat.	1238.6312932739854
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	736.3331619293455
Well, it is a long rest.	204.98804097834815
Feel no more.	371.77185980278716
It ’ s the moment you feel.	191.01080982052562
Must be damned unpleasant.	974.720275400712
Can ’ t believe it at first.	323.4377534555712
Mistake must be: someone else.	849.0812265370096
Try the house opposite.	416.6621414288133
Wait, I wanted to.	153.19685668108357
I haven ’ t yet.	308.3350465844757
Then darkened deathchamber.	1412.543669335156
Light they want.	402.868827332224
Whispering around you.	500.3579608485288
Would you like to see a priest?	380.8489606542123
Then rambling and wandering.	660.2725927362949
Delirium all you hid all your life.	707.4744679277709
His sleep is not natural.	435.5198910602352
Press his lower eyelid.	1252.2543525144729
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	1063.6198054692156
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	687.702545830417
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	553.4412572540267
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	500.9258087101032
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	3786.9181510127623
Bam! He expires.	904.6694345799611
Gone at last.	338.42183867529917
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	501.1383273226824
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	351.5292626756354
Remember him in your prayers.	442.7736740819316
Even Parnell.	544.8239071308706
Ivy day dying out.	825.0010813315887
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	454.32997123274345
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	479.2468978784872
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	409.0817739367854
Nice change of air.	403.77915046636315
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	469.08636740525213
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	614.215589269802
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	399.35158309074427
Someone walking over it.	459.73585755002426
Near you.	195.08716906584215
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	848.1105028326809
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	582.2019470388194
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	959.603606103139
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	303.8483958993418
And if he was alive all the time?	295.46668714492785
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	456.02441169462384
Of course he is dead.	332.4476058876882
Monday he died.	354.69368091243837
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	863.1902215817042
Flag of distress.	819.4253490255151
Three days.	314.04234128743775
Rather long to keep them in summer.	528.0145718012556
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	466.5833638421126
The clay fell softer.	1008.769933912725
Begin to be forgotten.	460.30624626141974
Out of sight, out of mind.	246.92808187061354
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	682.4187611037654
Had enough of it.	231.3848639534279
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	758.6668410851042
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	851.1127923425505
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	662.8229099350674
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	907.4667795359227
Ah, the names.	151.0230832295193
But he knows them all.	236.6158546773474
No: coming to me.	175.44623947677584
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	524.1271720834118
What is your christian name?	564.5532924415929
I ’ m not sure.	197.85573685041115
Leopold.	111.29593536450072
He asked me to.	128.77592538476497
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	456.4441225381596
I know.	78.61644231691729
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	620.8837940974925
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	992.7044183657962
Find out what they imagine they know.	651.5227662191033
He died of a Tuesday.	264.55792846968467
Got the run.	229.02448545172695
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	568.4793349366388
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	368.67649986822084
That was why he asked me to.	230.11488725611
O well, does no harm.	384.87083802400247
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	182.26388034256277
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	613.8157938796824
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	1394.9659952050984
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	185.14936926523768
He looked around.	276.93023509139675
— Macintosh.	291.6913117864695
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	155.4993455621818
Where is he now?	252.1737489923743
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	547.5385395571494
I don ’ t know who he is.	206.6906673573
Is that his name?	265.0097511630633
He moved away, looking about him.	297.4037202710954
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	320.40024525596067
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	348.902183512797
What?	128.2987952047132
Where has he disappeared to?	469.7202344154058
Not a sign.	233.1830825111191
Well of all the.	85.13857370727666
Has anybody here seen?	1379.575507801458
Kay ee double ell.	3408.9373755979373
Become invisible.	1041.5606143351663
Good Lord, what became of him?	409.07411136782594
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	1749.512256127314
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	645.1824193697839
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	403.4463344885409
It rose.	210.2614544971453
Nearly over.	404.0819387646242
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	1098.2561297867112
All uncovered again for a few instants.	875.8367341852532
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	641.2914339693159
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	1415.6277587221407
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	918.6113151526389
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	1022.8309826704445
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	1303.8523471898677
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	1379.2984667437897
His navelcord.	426.0632314461519
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	547.4223438594472
Thanks in silence.	328.59485006206603
Sorry, sir: trouble.	383.0181089156924
Headshake.	362.3144614049264
I know that.	88.95354636999582
For yourselves just.	717.1796790434771
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	1466.5567314570922
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	421.19614735516245
— Let us, Mr Power said.	261.8297804060031
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	463.71154394485217
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	647.824499799096
That the coffin was filled with stones.	454.35265540705603
That one day he will come again.	365.62071393058295
Hynes shook his head.	461.61786669966847
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	317.3431364379109
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	157.46753350562864
Peace to his ashes.	433.46311730331064
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	1649.9481895896342
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	874.6203114888282
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	233.28798593735067
Does anybody really?	1813.4435922306918
Plant him and have done with him.	340.8419724601809
Like down a coalshoot.	499.6825868302121
Then lump them together to save time.	723.3978953545054
All souls ’ day.	311.33613667458025
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	403.15538522134517
Ten shillings for the gardener.	524.0856784111934
He keeps it free of weeds.	534.1536738922807
Old man himself.	311.80222687312977
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	1633.9223982889382
Near death ’ s door.	368.2840495130548
Who passed away.	344.2499986148519
Who departed this life.	625.067203992095
As if they did it of their own accord.	475.16403586884064
Got the shove, all of them.	208.58105774914495
Who kicked the bucket.	470.1007409155543
So and So, wheelwright.	335.7755943307947
I travelled for cork lino.	1097.57488408582
I paid five shillings in the pound.	416.81853956479557
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	288.72874389981973
I cooked good Irish stew.	943.7507766407306
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	1168.8525680141422
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	809.2778155819507
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	614.6163633929431
The great physician called him home.	710.5504634013022
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	292.1257799469008
Nice country residence.	924.4811398725863
Newly plastered and painted.	1316.5022948579108
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	1734.5128852141463
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	2616.0319256354533
Better value that for the money.	342.223100359772
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	448.33595081646945
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	1127.9022813837971
Expresses nothing.	673.6651193106577
Immortelles.	362.3144614049264
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	2517.1579209294773
Like stuffed.	562.1414013148257
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	506.22482509493346
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	836.3557080428384
Dead animal even sadder.	2001.256142717967
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	1229.6200916784346
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	499.08905738878315
Heart on his sleeve.	396.14572024514587
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	753.9946204793637
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	437.626700979638
Seems anything but pleased.	961.0043558945667
Why this infliction?	1065.1763919445034
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	669.20834905184
Apollo that was.	239.8885099718219
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	967.6579488391277
Besides how could you remember everybody?	1320.5326694888547
Eyes, walk, voice.	259.7216036211215
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	236.60843801997333
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	476.6933489120831
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	859.6694662969626
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	17623.75130900409
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	357.2059090787719
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	648.1936085263831
For instance who?	664.3400194484826
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	635.1940693595071
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	951.0446905413415
Wait.	118.6143906508203
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	1128.524453519402
Some animal.	503.43651878161137
Wait.	118.6143906508203
There he goes.	224.07975125257792
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	1308.0514808133337
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	906.331503114355
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	973.6220778186204
Good hidingplace for treasure.	1128.6316929718114
Who lives there?	559.5628094667716
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	1147.776899273459
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	1026.149438751488
Making his rounds.	720.1435319225614
Tail gone now.	732.0506401556323
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	635.8208594032033
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	688.4504450985444
Ordinary meat for them.	634.1358477360108
A corpse is meat gone bad.	870.4929071761454
Well and what ’ s cheese?	332.0160424735433
Corpse of milk.	377.7992986025515
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	731.0720070905159
Cremation better.	645.3356490622084
Priests dead against it.	606.5806255871183
Devilling for the other firm.	496.221643069185
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	5452.33175695361
Time of the plague.	253.23643000356196
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	1179.626428173246
Lethal chamber.	1023.7495956619516
Ashes to ashes.	596.0524937421609
Or bury at sea.	632.8194573335097
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	907.395146100215
Eaten by birds.	742.5151609442602
Earth, fire, water.	318.9119878629272
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	613.5160761375357
See your whole life in a flash.	513.7620087306194
But being brought back to life no.	427.2693241954768
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	431.93828638257514
Out of a flying machine.	519.3318079532254
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	807.970553281239
Underground communication.	1530.8627101488164
We learned that from them.	328.6445327483427
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	479.40298803835043
Regular square feed for them.	959.8999547321112
Got wind of Dignam.	401.4786033678614
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	320.0993476622747
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	2708.661865600269
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	908.6224633571526
Back to the world again.	260.41260700442115
Enough of this place.	349.5979683709828
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	680.261164791281
Poor papa too.	539.0839058958495
The love that kills.	334.88768561282257
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	1162.0726352980685
Give you the creeps after a bit.	377.93886054112255
I will appear to you after death.	353.86497208222085
You will see my ghost after death.	602.0876632669376
My ghost will haunt you after death.	1045.157670443006
There is another world after death named hell.	988.7132061000336
I do not like that other world she wrote.	359.4032254857326
No more do I.	197.51715893947747
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	480.81306535589044
Feel live warm beings near you.	1401.1719272768169
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	986.6095024468574
They are not going to get me this innings.	565.9741618795939
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	1920.2187536282365
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	1095.795207391386
Solicitor, I think.	263.1837024169441
I know his face.	138.33215665912135
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	825.0295565299093
Dignam used to be in his office.	285.7427903306675
Convivial evenings.	1132.9651678195964
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	1125.8586945377335
Heart of gold really.	471.45544249797103
Yes, Menton.	169.08167556504375
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	862.219771933496
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	888.7841475131679
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	665.5031744421328
Hate at first sight.	681.4633544042825
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	1064.1306656689114
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	666.4164279238371
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	302.4823732254657
Carriage probably.	875.8445868638984
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	300.71949582017425
They stopped.	259.83011324060936
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	464.61837129953096
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	1063.1774670460848
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	565.5448844384911
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	1072.851486994506
He clapped the hat on his head again.	324.8424937684802
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	264.66754864421927
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	1113.1062499984882
— Thank you, he said shortly.	259.7461558559081
They walked on towards the gates.	402.8980400705136
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	719.6984527758846
Martin laying down the law.	489.061542328283
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	620.415561436278
Oyster eyes.	480.5371166229848
Never mind.	318.60636084894105
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	935.6953451883898
Get the pull over him that way.	348.8461773919933
Thank you.	172.3172505776897
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	2722.0560407036432
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	1821.3740499487787
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	2474.8605858378764
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	1158.6983908519603
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	2994.6637431384843
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	2911.3024803223157
— There it is, Red Murray said.	317.8665554895528
Alexander Keyes.	633.9668000180056
— Just cut it out, will you?	307.364883258107
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	273.3379509612778
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	630.0650154301841
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	946.3964054869433
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	1345.484225723787
Scissors and paste.	709.9378788761672
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	363.970357748993
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	618.8597568010248
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	263.30448997565196
I ’ ll rub that in.	207.19169429541896
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	1383.7691348556355
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	859.4969342422922
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	1062.9758720006687
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	1295.6065244281194
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	428.0622212544649
Welts of flesh behind on him.	461.386827508898
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	568.8313938014793
— Don ’ t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	573.1238702700485
Red Murray whispered.	1179.6192206453786
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	903.8526335616868
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	679.6669053485147
Way in.	173.79493743805165
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	1205.6506944398468
Mary, Martha.	233.3929462651222
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	1199.7323377493399
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	326.5707242261032
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	645.2564522696255
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	523.9079902649951
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	2084.9672243201926
Hand on his heart.	323.0540194267156
In <URL> Co - ome thou lost one, Co - ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	2779.6432385720395
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	650.0970491322536
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	768.2328182259024
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	964.3377240045783
But will he save the circulation?	553.4049710616654

Thumping.	287.5691785887357
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	1467.6358807921144
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	1201.81140534705

Working away, tearing away.	725.6537425675973

HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	3825.372286387606

— Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	404.75165465061554
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	1139.5836000713605
Long John is backing him, they say.	499.3350506180371
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	593.2710994818908
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	1063.2007759887993
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	559.9997437711529
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	209.12883610203588
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	615.3452663731316
— Did you?	214.95511271676446
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	244.47785028639566
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	430.1135844881581
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	244.19488274132553
I ’ ll tap him too.	273.49715350762324
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	862.8394499020285
Three bob I lent him in Meagher ’ s.	559.5595715192281
Three weeks.	458.140470450872
Third hint.	1217.4503031423524
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	2789.0600603703638
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	232.5063467466141
Keyes, you remember?	340.2494377533677
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	1140.3459444036391
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	284.1576885215903
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	729.9615311475535
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	205.27252986390604
He wants it changed.	346.697722213818
Keyes, you see.	171.21876135851474
He wants two keys at the top.	456.70569355621666
Hell of a racket they make.	535.9768507691385
He doesn ’ t hear it.	273.2977687489372
Nannan.	287.5691785887357
Iron nerves.	952.7063482268222
Maybe he understands what I.	528.1614086220305
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	967.4519925271146
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	366.70531015494964
Let him take that in first.	254.1681667051854
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	817.7042415816209
Clank it.	268.3565835904006
Clank it.	268.3565835904006
Miles of it unreeled.	585.4949642387754
What becomes of it after?	316.6502479233119
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	763.3358740355352
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	1485.686955662576
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	939.0776620580225
Two crossed keys here.	882.0416884409314
A circle.	228.87923177810262
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	855.4155426384574
So on.	114.90382369159191
Better not teach him his own business.	676.4461118255191
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	429.0368021945957
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	435.37678534622955
You see?	230.81465353603699
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	334.5460548347908
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	1225.4339033801527
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	200.16958520345145
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	532.2893544911432
Innuendo of home rule.	789.1266704314124
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	359.810156713093
Catches the eye, you see.	234.9337895279992
Can you do that?	296.50486947964936
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	715.0638973939376
Better not.	183.8517270209483
— We can do that, the foreman said.	237.03267032553026
Have you the design?	367.26519488454295
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	170.8157516149643
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	294.9295269665156
He has a house there too.	228.86668562586613
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	309.4485829320264
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	537.2861491359943
Longfelt want.	600.1580390024463
So on.	114.90382369159191
The foreman thought for an instant.	570.8786023333391
— We can do that, he said.	167.5216310211899
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	693.7937955861698
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	1169.3877740753205
He began to check it silently.	635.8560607235397
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	1004.0631828956133
ORTHOGRAPHICAL Want to be sure of his spelling.	789.2732066076708

Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	449.419957445063
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	502.30799697520155
Thank you.	172.3172505776897
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	416.1671817725685

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	1017.1140049160987
— Monks, sir?	291.70170262267453
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	348.5562734368776
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	488.66302182741896
Time to get out.	237.94704681671425
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	276.03164800145356
— Monks! — Yes, sir.	251.39344016585505

Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	1251.7495741947698

And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	646.4656222741136
Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.	711.1067213434858

Seems to see with his fingers.	303.67602828866524
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	514.5979379372986
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	446.52770067241795
Better phone him up first.	620.3482078526104

Ah, the soap I put there.	227.92610712942002

Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	650.7723699315617
What perfume does your wife use?	1133.3172507724091

No. Here.	128.51219983745983
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	1003.9334052306882
Know who that is.	252.06429393315818
What ’ s up?	147.81332460865386
Ned Lambert it is.	275.6491733814781
He entered softly.	440.10899100174396
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	3241.548749918295
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	877.0904987356411
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	1477.796565442516
What about that, Simon?	228.7791646182912
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	300.5904528001049
How ’ s that for high?	226.44673492713594
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	337.2751210669109
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	987.4347917899623
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	594.0322251634026
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	442.14442198633986
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	317.1562135871581
High falutin stuff.	1595.5384555357023
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	458.93011153164986
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	488.7883574635791
He has influence they say.	382.898476561049
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	729.1633088445075

— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	651.884311449896
— What is it?	155.58654219722976
Mr Bloom asked.	169.48270452529925
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	1528.4199370520291
_Our lovely land_.	2130.622068684014
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	6583.661325310754
Mr Bloom said simply.	229.28901630014147
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	778.8437535733432
With an accent on the whose.	383.0035706065318
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	512.8078206399564
— Is it his speech last night?	488.349627083256
Mr Bloom asked.	169.48270452529925
— But listen to this, he said.	193.5665917529291
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	399.84752826138305
— Excuse me, J.	213.38182617858544

O ’ Molloy said, entering.	270.06053980789136
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	863.1470527661858
— I beg yours, he said.	239.85282910615462
— Good day, Jack.	242.1582913329802
— Come in.	104.30054705504865
Come in.	94.89623690656842
— Good day.	192.85274704480648

J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	447.85572678716636
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	465.4516289858326
To be seen and heard.	296.06748168732673
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	243.26673833305102

O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	708.6810391089026
Practice dwindling.	1383.2906121420679

Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	1550.5349502457902
Wellread fellow.	596.6652153987036
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	1053.6442971075348
Weathercocks.	362.3144614049264
Hot and cold in the same breath.	362.78592889174996
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	369.4257144423776
One story good till you hear the next.	594.1322298177404
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	669.731457385918
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	911.1928565284694
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	586.8388257597755
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	957.5718105262033
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	610.6135055557143
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	751.0221517596036
Is he taking anything for it?	434.5684411928605
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	1842.2580850755753
He forgot Hamlet.	435.8352784423709
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	494.2536713024465
Life is too short.	493.91994338115586
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	1131.1932784319038
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	1271.8416768023765
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	1931.4252038075367
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	715.8229297783223
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	1963.3498472864615
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	344.0322095199555
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	1200.225732180913
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	1330.2146493136083
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	1070.716153934496
Hooked that nicely.	786.1543229191241

Wetherup always said that.	365.5983686640372
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	387.6778789485449
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	1220.3566261306798
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	664.1228656410487
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	1310.2035575735867
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	692.6288158287133
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	261.8580546157847
I must get a drink after that.	266.21863227189107
— Drink! the editor cried.	389.07718904314476
No drinks served before mass.	1329.9841024589132
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	297.2234138932906
Come on, Ned.	167.95925786748288
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	743.4346300048365
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	596.9851908540579
— Will you join us, Myles?	604.6205053021009
Ned Lambert asked.	453.2625973325186
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	2151.7014467542617
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	879.110955736413
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	1055.5743624004658
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	619.7802201853588
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	517.6519880573366
Passing out he whispered to J.	473.65828925960244
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	745.435165144245
Sad case.	423.2348742166173
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	1246.2739181054042
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	780.116181370573
Long, short and long.	257.5897774091018
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	1248.7586423375715
— Bingbang, bangbang.	550.4863921368014
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	464.0087860653611
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	202.12988257374275
I just want to phone about an ad.	592.0268575273096
He went in.	104.64944940864653
— What about that leader this evening?	583.2046367109622
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	598.3273711690258
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	497.84740138782666
Never you fret.	611.7410823190977
Hello, Jack.	222.403007757581
That ’ s all right.	152.328689027966
— Good day, Myles, J.	232.5730837509035
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	698.6244927098212
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	1456.3484983918745
The telephone whirred inside.	1207.225616473421
— Twentyeight...	93.31813619249674
Double four...	183.39827643971796
Yes.	79.54417819042295
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	1243.4829966543696
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	858.4198690930386
he asked.	89.54079260770219
Sceptre with O.	249.17797859230708
Madden up.	192.44569829705105
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	293.2887585026921
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	935.6842036329384
— Hush, Lenehan said.	272.0463484350862
I hear feetstoops.	443.55579382803705
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	984.6631073891797
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	797.0358789978708
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	234.65622217751124
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	346.3246222880575
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	295.861624878695
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	446.58838287394224
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	812.3685742932491
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	429.59336353736717
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	620.3057601084765
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	771.3408924415118
— Him, sir.	179.3098147088535
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	467.1683875378222
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	408.01756007696054
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	1116.2657172214833
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	717.1803410080574
Is the boss...?	125.42222727295879
Yes, _Telegraph_...	108.4537892803941
To where?	318.784432747588
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	520.7012423459998
Aha! I see...	125.70169654402939
Right.	156.1165688701983
I ’ ll catch him.	199.09996814667815
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	1853.2813489933023
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	782.3415456693912
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	668.5159744453275
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	449.1147998173692
Are you hurt?	613.221809333284
I ’ m in a hurry.	178.71853169916048
— Knee, Lenehan said.	288.26956654415153
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	993.2864275053037
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	218.02034223739722
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	322.6597684335638
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	651.0722707582331
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	965.1936553332315
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	501.3129235007733
Want to fix it up.	416.1361334813506
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	260.74501390464354
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	604.9774897556513
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	953.973204251036
— Begone! he said.	235.6479506453497
The world is before you.	215.33339457683857
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	324.63716069550475
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	693.9073454587666
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	568.801741726636
Look at the young scamps after him.	486.92969906484194
— Show.	173.44069168047335
Where?	201.5556843520298
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	273.6281706341133
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	1271.5527545605657
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	487.16523761737994
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	994.7042768842543
Small nines.	1287.2969652097265
Steal upon larks.	1869.4208829230981
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	1260.8360730117354
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	685.8136184956919
— What ’ s that?	126.48086317101261
Myles Crawford said with a start.	440.9314222501256
Where are the other two gone?	420.5436477458954
— Who?	177.54062056318844
the professor said, turning.	158.21666895808562
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	436.1034923206351
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	1136.2113278696397
Came over last night.	621.587097200331
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	319.4362056236038
Where ’ s my hat?	267.5191191493659
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	744.9015518997692
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	711.3596034801286
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	364.8224432822463
— Seems to be, J.	191.18618153384023
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	562.3280779764971
Who has the most matches?	614.5053543904739
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	1040.5185864450302
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	984.1797013273947
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	492.7618645617238
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	777.0297558453123
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	686.6271179842321
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	1999.6146618774453
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	802.2665569920758
— Eh?	283.4823815992919
You bloody old Roman empire?	1214.888183998072
Myles Crawford said.	354.7785834416764
He took a cigarette from the open case.	362.25493768526496
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	836.5366364995964
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said gently.	317.8606315662077
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	2448.5459621262917
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	558.1221547494437
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	1815.3790468797129
— That ’ s it, he said.	96.78421108026679
We are the fat.	211.25248077137428
You and I are the fat in the fire.	173.57897140620645
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	556.8800757404493
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	2183.4020394472664
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	628.9432827781108
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	788.3838875892635
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	2304.6085717466835
Vast, I allow: but vile.	685.0455584207657
Cloacae: sewers.	1030.48914156065
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	557.6226019523426
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	1424.3289527499028
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	872.2285754330271
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	480.35790761933765
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	781.7305365316035
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	693.3846944012887
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	294.9648083369892
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy murmured.	389.18389123588196
But we have also Roman law.	775.0399734601028
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	1768.4258900175016
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	1536.5492460899916
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy asked.	244.25392580293178
Everything was going swimmingly...	353.37114806196786
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	395.3795317298218
Are you ready?	573.313258033414
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	779.8055496916669
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	367.21434862628996
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	1007.6657096042608
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	4715.230037500648
— How do you do?	299.833914715981
the editor said, holding out a hand.	213.62852011790875
Come in.	94.89623690656842
Your governor is just gone.	853.6794913885151
???	91.79681218984717
Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	969.3816034844141
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	907.054469165139
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	766.8171648877756
— Who?	177.54062056318844
the editor asked.	179.91126309823517
Bit torn off.	879.1625130470065
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	349.2310085102697
— That old pelters, the editor said.	333.30390384471065
Who tore it?	528.1542641183962
Was he short taken?	782.8365739915428
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	1755.1443595643677
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	355.3096564204177
Foot and mouth?	443.967804094547
Are you turned...?	121.01817090490259
Bullockbefriending bard.	1051.073570732379
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	1894.6984328361377
The letter is not mine.	328.7714581294572
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	263.21450468499967
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	236.93301714351705
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	1352.1659816063614
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	577.9105334850713
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	763.2102611885465
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	747.4814506148259
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	442.28615356064336
— Is he a widower?	344.92563735689384
Stephen asked.	140.93745844441872
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	480.71056951552526
Emperor ’ s horses.	392.223622947844
Habsburg.	362.3144614049264
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	950.7501682859993
Don ’ t you forget! Maximilian Karl O ’ Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	1710.7211243396575
Going to be trouble there one day.	496.0170633611772
Wild geese.	978.1341721973457
O yes, every time.	221.76198195583862
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	478.26536977452935
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	829.261987060305
Saving princes is a thank you job.	1030.265878609228
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	545.5120445553332
— And if not?	214.56373810904427
he said.	56.271385512740096
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	365.78363568919275
A Hungarian it was one day...	178.20799728074724
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	2431.826740815964
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	339.15894909927897
We were never loyal to the successful.	527.7557120785931
We serve them.	436.54987435147586
I teach the blatant Latin language.	935.3616485636021
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	587.3202653354549
Material domination.	1530.8627101488164
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	750.033662883269
Lord Jesus?	586.227849625244
Lord Salisbury?	1215.7922719108897
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	1421.86855555702
— The Greek! he said again.	240.04589987417287
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	997.8095791791762
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	552.3246251909577
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	350.09998057244775
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	1281.975236198701
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	1036.8075340332603
They went under.	268.7288799982977
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	1202.0383956797446
Loyal to a lost cause.	512.3852092299755
He strode away from them towards the window.	457.5732475719195
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	730.889286709862
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	786.5601073763926
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	717.7464726889771
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	1609.9195759477773
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	2422.251191127304
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	326.64787971844385
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	538.7597747409227
Whose mother is beastly dead.	1091.0923243091106
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	1098.0944688762963
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	180.32369139945664
I ’ ll read the rest after.	237.04091753744981
That ’ ll be all right.	235.87922398517816
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	688.9228321446218
— But my riddle! he said.	276.8674385934164
What opera is like a railwayline?	707.2078935265763
— Opera?	434.1269480091095
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	909.5311310847409
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	1608.2651124478302
See the wheeze?	508.346792300796
Rows of cast steel.	841.6708438475878
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	1167.1753565638007
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	853.1484357872067
— Help! he sighed.	468.9698873835857
I feel a strong weakness.	476.7224823149528
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	897.0450800443406
— Paris, past and present, he said.	193.4452960506021
You look like communards.	633.9769711595078
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	661.389476533519
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	460.1119946080336
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	758.9466390122531
You look as though you had done the deed.	463.0491491464236
General Bobrikoff.	1132.9651678195964
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	742.153737018914
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	421.81925477068836
Law, the classics...	156.35419473428237
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	252.6968623417308
— Literature, the press.	253.74047420127172
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	228.72928110806149
The gentle art of advertisement.	526.9845746370214
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	527.6100392845602
The vocal muse.	875.606107737366
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	516.3986765812549
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	735.0271082680321
— Ahem! he said very softly.	478.0740032457028
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	335.1588623938112
The gate was open.	300.02916754697645
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	2536.5390761852686
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	204.4888167598503
Something with a bite in it.	244.19484393475346
You can do it.	207.54122136803417
I see it in your face.	162.9078046312654
_In the lexicon of youth_...	365.77547237907424
See it in your face.	225.10776235870586
See it in your eye.	249.84564559597268
Lazy idle little schemer.	2510.0559452417738
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	1092.2466637204232
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	2123.8376437122743
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	707.7406946487565
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	531.7482209252926
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	1124.0887722408095
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	909.5398892380875
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	812.7294872686897
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	278.72662648322586
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said.	179.20605057117575
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	1213.6337921217994
Wait a minute.	299.08635187021747
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	1089.2831319636707
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	256.1118005108411
That was a pen.	212.46929874503058
You know how he made his mark?	566.206751582902
I ’ ll tell you.	157.93851789901106
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	916.8902166659797
I ’ ll show you.	177.6269695587937
He pushed past them to the files.	443.7691404110031
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	2035.6024737468788
Remember that time?	377.2064225666534
Professor MacHugh nodded.	1205.2871350080668
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	1205.0354517538763
Where it took place.	313.82754809962216
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	911.8682174750087
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	266.7727926888827
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	840.5929904314789
Whole route, see?	790.4527118770123
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	520.0034326202967
Fitzharris.	287.5691785887357
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	482.7169747639262
Holohan told me.	453.1077944967637
You know Holohan?	750.3182734638325
— Hop and carry one, is it?	355.721232668895
Myles Crawford said.	354.7785834416764
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	539.3031021544742
A night watchman.	442.890639900616
Stephen turned in surprise.	308.8256343191284
— Gumley?	365.0557943458958
he said.	56.271385512740096
You don ’ t say so?	372.53802378139403
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	1368.885949765476
Look at here.	258.6784480265291
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	1193.1836968361006
I ’ ll tell you.	157.93851789901106
Inspiration of genius.	563.5425638083076
Cabled right away.	695.4459281498563
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	1683.5852326949723
Right.	156.1165688701983
Have you got that?	337.3846631174153
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	552.5388001655755
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	785.3241856507886
Have you got that?	337.3846631174153
Right.	156.1165688701983
The telephone whirred.	797.0485678488221
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	368.1028164335122
— B is parkgate.	469.7150498822315
Good.	106.38652831975911
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	1353.6869437340538
— T is viceregal lodge.	758.353847671689
C is where murder took place.	725.7349878770723
K is Knockmaroon gate.	1251.9200975217057
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	677.9754387248248
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	1493.4157267444061
— Hello?	258.13342769342484
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	307.21402748979506
Hello?...	71.36127079720433

Yes...	42.443360575753104
Yes.	79.54417819042295
— F to P is the route Skin - the - Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	1378.38094821067
<URL>. Got that?	217.37952973357233
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	1157.628026695931
The professor came to the inner door.	352.2984975480696
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	158.92816295200305
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	412.4677183845207
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	615.7622445002987
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	707.6016393055603
Very.	152.1625388684635
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	541.3624919426856
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	861.5576715359894
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	268.21264100798527
I was present.	133.84315997307837
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	680.3822024166493
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	533.6681724844534
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	1014.7434958698448
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	771.4860647629786
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	468.4374211645254
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	563.2937647085846
Out of an advertisement.	368.24705631188056
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	794.9150278953723
That gave him the leg up.	273.33030929060925
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <URL> Now he ’ s got in with Blumenfeld.	1030.3337957834974
That ’ s press.	195.76666618273595
That ’ s talent.	291.94711811501986
Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	892.2117039999149
— Hello?...	79.51680416112703
Are you there?...	99.87049676774197
Yes, he ’ s here still.	159.3350206961006
Come across yourself.	569.9506756469093
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	531.4216959485394
the editor cried.	212.6639778773467
He flung the pages down.	336.73280915884374
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	703.7334119499063
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	495.76676475818135
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	868.5694247149302
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	374.2077651100101
— O yes, J.	157.16797172394755
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	385.920219084243
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	918.4121820570667
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin - the - Goat.	1029.4284010130812
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! — They ’ re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	788.956166537926
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	884.7622580134472
Eh?	348.78337379607075
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	722.7892590032463
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	2313.9094846061616
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	1056.589342137743
Why did you write it then?	454.21827143241194
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	2603.5802406086495
Is the mouth south someway?	922.73356643102
Or the south a mouth?	370.6379181977531
Must be some.	237.40895663875133
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	443.82912873869617
Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two.	432.819170887353

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, _per l ’ aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più <URL> But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.	1479.1517733634837

O ’ Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	559.4209412533668
— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	658.3949388722557
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	1249.6379072738964
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	1515.7557931256392
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly ’ s Budget_, _Pue ’ s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	2003.9021966253758
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	1454.2964734816246
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	578.9731497678933
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE — Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.	2086.3230586742557

the editor said.	124.07140260145113
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	278.28084999186024
He has a strain of it in his blood.	237.1803461560906
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	1790.37182495378
— He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....	203.51754333865313
But no matter.	283.3705917977494
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	656.2003805593016
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	484.1003711409552
Bushe defended him.	736.6329072566474
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	727.7689070322622
He died in his sleep.	240.65053272202758
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	740.9586431314078
— What was that?	141.5786276309852
the professor asked.	150.25088107815537
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	756.5846185804821
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	1094.0292879856231
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	542.9883167587656
— Ha. — A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	788.9572827445437
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	472.54114660310387
False lull.	1530.8627101488164
Something quite ordinary.	982.3317329555464
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	1498.9181436755505
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	791.707744376266
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	1411.2763698498995
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	1152.190382384402
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	597.5602323078264
— The divine afflatus, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	609.6126130851301
— You like it?	184.45637014816543
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy asked Stephen.	286.5252745382601
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	693.7130837301139
He took a cigarette from the case.	280.9244351378405
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	627.6417625069038
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: — Muchibus thankibus.	1258.5931364234905
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	1431.6294262041126
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	192.2121955732044
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	918.7289431660547
E.	145.31432739865093
the mastermystic?	334.3300006197661
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	510.50994556997074
A.	53.193264159879526
E.	145.31432739865093
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	817.5677317695362
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	1115.355032563062
E. ’ s leg.	180.6039613333282
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	454.975957688786
Speaking about me.	365.1718708693693
What did he say?	273.1952027824778
What did he say?	273.1952027824778
What did he say about me?	321.2826314709479
Don ’ t ask.	289.05905301169764
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	581.5583839176215
Wait a moment.	210.91873453533418
Let me say one thing.	363.9686053506143
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	1511.7160331221783
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	907.3039060519186
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	781.8088544217478
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	529.4977198750121
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	542.7534884031713
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	731.5508107470052
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	355.9121258831174
Go on.	160.10233393727577
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	853.824601517813
It was then a new movement.	337.7034858287411
We were weak, therefore worthless.	1036.5451964514818
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	1106.75168346351
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	2135.6470648623263
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	407.91023239881974
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	607.036678351351
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	1008.9395925573884
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	731.8562052328593
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	722.0910916066651
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	371.67742359215123
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	1779.2610869630012
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	1106.1906410311426
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	466.0977238799598
He raised his head firmly.	520.2184163103793
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	1092.3716450645318
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	2225.7921866116903
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	767.8444469032079
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	1088.5551154657483
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	2232.535259082907
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	728.4169948893114
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	549.9411008833783
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	1490.8535603966297
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	536.0825566758292
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	1029.566487954234
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	944.0600769173517
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	1957.4788083373292
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	1102.1320051029325
Child, man, effigy.	368.7889712821019
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	1132.894441239472
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	1461.2977104403888
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	874.762013977859
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	1767.814043894788
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	774.6241419288605
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	780.4046701672127
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	1558.4875771340317
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	774.7437165086526
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	706.7892729082779
And with a great future behind him.	343.8816337751581
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	1117.4810644237393
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	471.58585007512187
Gone with the wind.	233.97531539438845
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	898.6379737124574
Miles of ears of porches.	665.7617198478291
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	649.7541275027847
A people sheltered within his voice.	796.0124742885732
Dead noise.	568.7172725945022
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	1192.2445651116402
Love and laud him: me no more.	455.91181168752087
I have money.	146.25585766414738
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	203.3998869275073
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	1134.1987844553653
— You take my breath away.	414.4090015162424
It is not perchance a French compliment?	1076.486413738112
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	453.4868828869448
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	1128.5824225220422
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	764.4459652359607
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	698.5055838116926
The contrary no.	323.8211144483257
I declare it carried.	399.6060846225846
To which particular boosing shed...?	522.7538878340215
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	1107.6997303569228
Yes, we will not.	183.95176488456855
By no manner of means.	483.30006683917367
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	704.0068760481048
Let us go.	326.3994280900827
Where are those blasted keys?	1380.259418370448
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	984.4211553123928
— Foot and mouth.	253.84301947305264
I know.	78.61644231691729
That ’ ll be all right.	235.87922398517816
That ’ ll go in.	178.45192025440414
Where are they?	307.6567000820512
That ’ s all right.	152.328689027966
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	565.5745091419294
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	384.5464301044042
Myles, one moment.	221.35865127919485
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	462.9541412175165
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	183.68250214677158
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	338.7696833568544
It has the prophetic vision.	641.6306323425135
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	1705.597615747607
Kingdoms of this world.	413.08084505997977
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	859.5560832577186
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	1027.5730585142724
I have much, much to learn.	239.1124631555195
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	479.4371796704788
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	202.82608398765205
— Yes?	165.58320782341158
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	389.83241678113137
Crawford will follow.	531.9699455234681
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	3060.55858622389
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	905.7282478376457
— Where is that?	191.31022622430902
the professor asked.	150.25088107815537
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	402.80185314135286
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	2550.19253911441
Against the wall.	325.8856782536838
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	4534.165450500561
Frantic hearts.	1041.5606143351663
Akasic records.	1383.2906121420679
Quicker, darlint! On now.	757.8819590666436
Dare it.	296.9853790920443
Let there be life.	296.5866344518339
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	404.9429231338044
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	1501.5823653034656
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	857.4566221194885
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	438.0516521703432
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	909.1436884771438
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	712.7449757190569
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	2138.9138256581978
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	794.0729430445982
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	867.4669822764985
Glory be to God.	312.8958750722804
They had no idea it was that high.	323.65040200994343
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	2930.361929121703
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	1302.9124269481274
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	1865.4128056659536
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	528.428929532946
Vestal virgins.	1082.4834034118442
I can see them.	173.02787115142098
What ’ s keeping our friend?	525.5603448279654
He turned.	121.22787727888645
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	1443.9160268825406
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	866.5782469007387
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy.	161.63764679616398
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	394.53787854813584
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	375.13462125376503
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	423.4119085797898
I see them.	110.9454201082687
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	1077.0225678519948
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	526.4921944506706
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	988.5073105084947
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	456.85159826444794
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	365.0071564845441
After he ’ ll see.	224.23385960421396
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	597.3679033752223
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	944.9446630127862
I can have access to it in the national library.	401.31954146565687
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	394.23986430401027
His name is Keyes.	391.9119039136115
It ’ s a play on the name.	166.87783819710944
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	670.7734529044599
But he wants just a little puff.	520.407349938285
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	333.12688757158065
<URL>. — Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	559.0421274674258
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	1001.712596394115
Tell him that straight from the stable.	466.7133167081102
Look out for squalls.	570.504631618776
All off for a drink.	239.00999776498952
Arm in arm.	479.2581861390414
Lenehan ’ s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	842.279796415906
Usual blarney.	1383.2906121420679
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	465.38051405863973
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	500.47618011891876
Been walking in muck somewhere.	1462.8441058127157
What was he doing in Irishtown?	432.9908432750389
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	408.460360219925

RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	912.2493902338153
I ’ m up to here.	155.42855150551142
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	537.5722976826315
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	536.2238445905169
Sorry, Jack.	322.3863543268948
You must take the will for the deed.	320.53330288722714
With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.	479.23568294713147

O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	541.5546728059501
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	562.2463858834143
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	663.4029157273515
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	424.9554272355855
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	543.291950182552
SOME COLUMN! — THAT ’ S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID — That ’ s new, Myles Crawford said.	1928.965590441505
That ’ s copy.	227.21418466261437
Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	649.9370166919613
Two old trickies, what?	585.6339233099483
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	473.761804454456
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	1052.2235238019434
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	2789.3218156012726
No poetic licence.	1143.7670671258422
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	354.58879060053886
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	918.9765545594307
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	733.6701241128637
I like that.	76.18929061185044
I see the idea.	132.15018144323753
I see what you mean.	219.24906392403713
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	1449.2723754405017
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	838.0475160727527
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	725.2432844596284
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	607.948147523643
— Finished?	516.2668553868497
Myles Crawford said.	354.7785834416764
So long as they do no worse.	506.32529326014804
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	4274.478069695876
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	466.76166532208043
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	686.3259293402745
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	242.29307009709788
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	750.8251460816053
Poor Penelope.	559.6148591681133
Penelope Rich.	952.7063482268222
They made ready to cross O ’ Connell street.	688.7874578005773
Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.	2549.5597249734155
WHAT? — AND LIKEWISE — WHERE?	2024.0372259187463
— But what do you call it?	333.69946660215146
Myles Crawford asked.	514.4510477747117
Where did they get the plums?	539.3356207415521

SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.	11875.283476508745
— Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to reflect.	478.1086621010198
Call it, let me see.	266.1682576224301
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	1392.4682765507146
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	788.6644874437401
He laughed richly.	544.5526056436623
— I see, he said again with new pleasure.	234.25594343107372
We gave him that idea, he added to J.	326.0490727706336

O ’ Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace.	1091.9674233294713
— I see, the professor said.	118.59617090573488
He halted on sir John Gray ’ s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.	1563.3183853236483
DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS.	24827.73840019313

That tickles me, I must say.	372.952002657108

Looking for grub.	690.6245493204959

He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball.	914.4320003579157
Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com.	3600.9024573066417

They wheeled, flapping.	528.9430510469089
The hungry famished gull Flaps o ’ er the waters dull.	2631.758497731453
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	698.0601213393865

Those poor birds.	718.5535276506405
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.	1311.6097144441221
See that?	227.28493691748056
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey.	1011.5175188358404

He has legs like barrels and you ’ d think he was singing into a barrel.	608.894008208459
Now, isn ’ t that wit.	375.32681027266165

Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	1175.3767585349935
Our staple food.	1211.8379945215327
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	550.9418400335518
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	1062.6799949887738
Doesn ’ t bring in any business either.	751.2290241219446
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	1408.2632297237924
I bet that would have caught on.	392.3029225774998
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	1155.381292283605
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	513.087876326152

I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.	388.7264944397081
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	440.8561934041145
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	562.2811872408671
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	639.8713443035597

Sweet name too: caramel.	820.4660870229848
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	257.7017123044313
If she had married she would have changed.	594.817657161808
I suppose they really were short of money.	462.99471524060476

Seeing her home after practice.	948.128726945216
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	1257.252630537901
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	1150.0486282465972
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin ’ s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	1109.1348815573078
He and I behind.	105.05980809742185
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	876.0303659040868
Lucky it didn ’ t.	372.85649907484253
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	432.23192307896676

Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.	2009.8088327848877
She did get flushed in the wind.	383.19546582929456
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	1439.652383227615
And the mulled rum.	542.8177683562581
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	722.4004408270398
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	903.0862305822557

— O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	228.0498041853085
— O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	339.22963013889597
— No use complaining.	680.5091074512206
How is Molly those times?	655.989253607531
Haven ’ t seen her for ages.	553.1722730479227
— In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	297.8010695296518
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	418.93342532422696
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	528.3571737611287
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
In a photographer ’ s there.	269.14726043779126
Getting on like a house on fire.	418.54213137430906
How are all your charges?	803.2224269803573
— All on the baker ’ s list, Mrs Breen said.	399.72857491918637
— You ’ re in black, I see.	180.26152278440367
You have no...	87.40756038549569
— No, Mr Bloom said.	134.17372695700502
I have just come from a funeral.	295.8819329423344
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	570.7003222327238
Who ’ s dead, when and what did he die of?	265.65370829589386
Turn up like a bad penny.	557.1516461462779
— O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	252.41289778924227
I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	658.6634544700332
May as well get her sympathy.	669.7374564025835
— Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	155.6733612329247
An old friend of mine.	429.07054261093987
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	555.6389489473105
Heart trouble, I believe.	372.7990267207214
Funeral was this morning.	479.9709733827063
Your funeral ’ s tomorrow While you ’ re coming through the rye.	828.3946594402104
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	778.6655089005411
— Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen ’ s womaneyes said melancholily.	821.6869223875153
Now that ’ s quite enough about that.	307.5085072445595
Just: quietly: husband.	446.40997975228356
— And your lord and master?	391.75597099014544
Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	624.1414709138046
— O, don ’ t be talking! she said.	232.27010685762914
He ’ s a caution to rattlesnakes.	325.70729141194306
He ’ s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	471.64804371326613
He has me heartscalded.	441.4483474585033
Wait till I show you.	355.9105922440557
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison ’ s.	3037.4517377710717
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom ’ s gullet.	746.9682073847134
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they ’ d taste it with the hot tea.	820.9238382167697
Or is it from her?	240.5949062877162
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	990.1099261779206
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	819.682265016389
Pleasure or pain is it?	738.3392124825392
Penny dinner.	696.5335628819292
Knife and fork chained to the table.	677.6299710384969

Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle.	1495.3882736664118
Pastille that was fell.	454.22912427261684
What is she?...	76.08174064362206
— There must be a new moon out, she said.	296.7941414886906
He ’ s always bad then.	230.94064850025208
Do you know what he did last night?	497.4112777117736
Her hand ceased to rummage.	821.7866407115856
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	768.254150511613
— What?	133.89864297395368
Mr Bloom asked.	169.48270452529925
Let her speak.	297.59225833307573
Look straight in her eyes.	348.5674166794571
I believe you.	129.23299159160732
Trust me.	334.34630228886977
— Woke me up in the night, she said.	219.35598958482205
Dream he had, a nightmare.	334.6667284248827
Indiges.	362.3144614049264
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	628.4062957959848
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	382.38727561434354
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	854.9888317882023
— Read that, she said.	167.2434362176578
He got it this morning.	265.62471540362503
— What is it?	155.58654219722976
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	261.6605331336249
U.	171.07155394842053
P.?	127.19277725191353
— U.	166.14703378727506
p: up, she said.	174.745665180359
Someone taking a rise out of him.	416.3823757480855
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	367.019028597021
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	216.40652973933678
She took back the card, sighing.	372.4230417024564
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	297.47527268949284
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	452.2328530438706
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	931.970238068441
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	1486.2855965678002
Seen its best days.	941.947211160415
Wispish hair over her ears.	832.3409325539493
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	721.4266588279012
Shabby genteel.	1694.178082865129
She used to be a tasty dresser.	604.4257603595845
Lines round her mouth.	565.2775337053821
Only a year or so older than Molly.	782.21052041852
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	326.0640019931078
Cruel.	266.9555776457352
The unfair sex.	844.2528455392852
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	539.8290781349561
Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	6920.466377936182
I ’ m hungry too.	298.52215836555735
Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.	1284.303909427845
Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior.	3883.5627062859758
Josie Powell that was.	498.1926613378039
In Luke Doyle ’ s long ago.	774.8326378328475

p: up.	197.41905946744282
— Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	654.8844567017409
Mr Bloom asked.	169.48270452529925
— Mina Purefoy?	651.2944560402034
she said.	77.3916913083994
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	611.7856964127342
Playgoers ’ Club.	740.6618222188115
Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.	875.1317991192815
Did I pull the chain?	577.6206510997099
Yes.	79.54417819042295
The last act.	283.1876768888854
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
— I just called to ask on the way in is she over it.	246.99976491526522
She ’ s in the lying - in hospital in Holles street.	359.3846495495187
Dr Horne got her in.	436.24580704012624
She ’ s three days bad now.	383.8293588689065
— O, Mr Bloom said.	121.79850024467476
I ’ m sorry to hear that.	256.3313414091573
— Yes, Mrs Breen said.	251.19249222773445
And a houseful of kids at home.	562.8013176244577
It ’ s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.	376.72274847142563
— O, Mr Bloom said.	121.79850024467476
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	2438.667179036818
His tongue clacked in compassion.	1010.9054012428143
Dth! Dth! — I ’ m sorry to hear that, he said.	407.10284874388526
Poor thing! Three days! That ’ s terrible for her.	514.7237979530504
Mrs Breen nodded.	704.6993693520133

Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: — Mind! Let this man pass.	970.0677910207429
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	1462.7280276224396
Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head.	1012.2801901522474

No sound.	271.38602900568446
The sky.	201.56867643790284
Green by Drumleck.	745.8599592665541
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	1752.7955925791039
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	1235.9551921074233
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	889.8463430274843
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	948.7259983071078
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	727.5843168924212
Yum.	362.3144614049264
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.	821.3395388678979
Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.	2378.5652215822147

She lay still.	336.24269688261694
A goat.	337.893462741676
No - one.	203.50602773831434
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	2795.197569319158
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	805.6653851715702
Hot I tongued her.	601.9749341568365
She kissed me.	275.6546252057056
All yielding she tossed my hair.	1001.666944799805
Kissed, she kissed me.	427.5878961834695
Me. And me now.	210.03280436495194
Stuck, the flies buzzed.	652.2759143619132

Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty.	805.6424089283375
Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires.	1317.7052133855484

Never speaking.	442.306446411897
I mean to say to fellows like Flynn.	390.5512578629356
Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?	1291.6951080668211
Mortal! Put you in your proper place.	796.3278832899666

Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop.	1173.9145680357067
Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian.	2289.677511855538
Immortal lovely.	709.5585194267692
And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.	896.7328738081263
They have no.	179.23768826292613

I ’ ll look today.	246.95435999852089
Bend down let something fall see if she.	931.9532169943282
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	650.3240216414124
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	651.4215536318283
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	572.1019556315407
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	426.84421904667386
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	271.20622596651134
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	435.0612777702695
Is he in trouble?	328.53737530172674
— Trouble?	466.49976492491106
Nosey Flynn said.	394.44638282123213
Not that I heard of.	154.1117349473273
Why?	203.35538390318914
— Was he?	214.5667994373148
Nosey Flynn said.	394.44638282123213
So he was, faith.	180.48717338361215
I asked him how was all at home.	269.9516177288542
You ’ re right, by God.	223.90893765522395
So he was.	115.19928218559946
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	574.7951497420934
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	707.6558559632554
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	323.5580494330426
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	717.2191417580561
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	298.5085937196631
Plovers on toast.	819.6164166700325
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	423.3813994288191
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	1154.6453078269658
You can make bacon of that.	371.4705205839943
— How so?	234.33546834731231
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	503.2048257404823
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	1285.1579865325648
He winked.	250.68623225759504
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	131.1070809925858
— Do you tell me so?	357.1435676617744
Davy Byrne said.	414.3457848601782
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	479.9531479760305
Ancient free and accepted order.	1232.911750782183
He ’ s an excellent brother.	325.0119907434553
Light, life and love, by God.	237.01476743161678
They give him a leg up.	310.6070944202991
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	229.5924914182236
— Is that a fact?	268.06438626257454
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	266.2465204902233
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	310.0095117112937
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	436.7936680355663
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	333.4290951065537
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	778.5943407640586
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	698.9446950065476
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	515.8744062514908
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	680.2072665601671
Decent quiet man he is.	464.7555878391743
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	318.5177511189397
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	967.2838262809798
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	1088.6371362918712
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	460.96574578524417
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	285.69333188220594
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	614.5461903155842
Declare to God he does.	385.91762209095924
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	368.2755957087934
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	350.6216057108015
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	361.75728333457647
Give the devil his due.	381.25292196484855
O, Bloom has his good points.	256.39568386113274
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	280.77978284009635
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	2005.5955250308748
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	261.60629328399335
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	403.1290572021152
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	808.4647776339174
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	1300.450770603434
— Day, Mr Byrne.	287.1779136970578
— Day, gentlemen.	262.78695521787483
They paused at the counter.	450.30585594227244
— Who ’ s standing?	263.6017442963222
Paddy Leonard asked.	651.5801385414968
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	559.3170520724591
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	215.56735646264852
Paddy Leonard asked.	651.5801385414968
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	520.6300301331344
— How much?	295.4725071674805
Paddy Leonard cried.	770.1998295262179
Since when, for God ’ sake?	471.38425222679103
What ’ s yours, Tom?	312.68801187497246
— How is the main drainage?	685.0817910220908
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	736.6016350417526
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	1281.0155067306987
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	534.561945063959
he said.	56.271385512740096
— Certainly, sir.	199.36020142045913
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	1615.329969170672
— Lord love a duck, he said.	240.019367476751
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	1385.002958742902
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	676.564615581161
A dead snip.	612.2288853849927
— Zinfandel is it?	328.3830557517451
Nosey Flynn asked.	571.9718280759395
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	1414.4420561716074
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	666.7545341967318
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	619.8964427133463
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	952.3365813041545
— Is it Zinfandel?	521.5467530224028
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	1281.9199984567979
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	601.5720081927259
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	626.535292001367
Who gave it to you?	244.41843632257908
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	557.7591437416957
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	498.5942965978974
The others turned.	267.2405674048154
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	969.7670632177955
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	309.4395149908444
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	2034.1225986247596
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	390.06528541297223
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	1050.376773793095

Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	1195.684162673761
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	1888.779147667273
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	747.416342947846
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	1809.5550066663166

No tram in sight.	419.64731865828094
Wants to cross.	433.59502882912375
— Do you want to cross?	419.6739336082998
Mr Bloom asked.	169.48270452529925
The blind stripling did not answer.	716.1770415661017
His wallface frowned weakly.	2413.6860507298115
He moved his head uncertainly.	494.7073663130334
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	284.1010143247136
Molesworth street is opposite.	703.1576250872309
Do you want to cross?	485.1063946449199
There ’ s nothing in the way.	161.74719706846076
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	521.5320336400254
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	753.8766287530253

Slaking his drouth.	735.4794836056411
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	240.63807390910512
I ’ ll see you across.	219.57248432134023
— Yes, the stripling answered.	227.2458121654294
South Frederick street.	759.3713175768231
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	151.91055621867687
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	1071.8069718570707
Say something to him.	234.08134537384626
Better not do the condescending.	473.4847945452296
They mistrust what you tell them.	588.8195867274189
Pass a common remark.	849.2119278846623
— The rain kept off.	434.2826344539959
No answer.	231.76509203199845
Stains on his coat.	481.24812236211613
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	405.8755017377407
Tastes all different for him.	431.49856396697317
Have to be spoonfed first.	559.3844540242593
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	205.17575576680747
Like Milly ’ s was.	224.15938600532814
Sensitive.	316.5108355747976
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	658.1253532228474
Wonder if he has a name.	277.7502880534263
Van.	316.5108355747976
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	1022.9840100278235
That ’ s right.	135.06334374351587
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	388.3567275077619
— Thanks, sir.	171.76780604412548
Knows I ’ m a man.	252.6776804299633
Voice.	362.3144614049264
— Right now?	352.4500070730731
First turn to the left.	264.004122648075
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	723.5595963666811
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	1204.8594415776195
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	704.1906507060254
Must have felt it.	305.61700251456534
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	734.9157659035936
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	634.4714126920934
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	544.10309417335
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	544.6438855410232
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	730.1884705856745
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	592.8649263661645
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	363.1805240930944
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	402.62886997542034
Read with their fingers.	406.47931598834026
Tune pianos.	1530.8627101488164
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	931.7835070443477
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	1197.052082337524
Of course the other senses are more.	550.9369463130911
Embroider.	362.3144614049264
Plait baskets.	1530.8627101488164
People ought to help.	583.2868421344828
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	745.1106380576418
Hates sewing.	1694.178082865129
Might take an objection.	912.2265939565751
Dark men they call them.	591.2614680970345
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	1110.7205309952246
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	916.7882136145596
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	329.692912875726
Tastes?	615.6634015351831
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	600.0338028930015
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	643.0065093544366
And with a woman, for instance.	181.55649582302223
More shameless not seeing.	1253.3689714667364
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	539.793505556452
Look at me.	195.36790610754792
I have them all on.	127.760681356114
Must be strange not to see her.	347.57963809742006
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	285.51837184776195
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	545.7208724011595
His hands on her hair, for instance.	307.38775791024534
Say it was black, for instance.	303.39076850231936
Good.	106.38652831975911
We call it black.	314.7608039488987
Then passing over her white skin.	619.4871309144761
Different feel perhaps.	875.6376929804954
Feeling of white.	320.7920092057227
Postoffice.	287.5691785887357
Fag today.	715.12411059843
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	789.9933731877161
Accept my little present.	740.586792707881
Stationer ’ s just here too.	439.0657254816702
Wait.	118.6143906508203
Think over it.	265.05527777016533
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	1101.8786156313897
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	626.034052157426
Downy hair there too.	647.7901902129961
Not smooth enough.	702.3794679349803
The belly is the smoothest.	372.2935070537551
No - one about.	249.60556740970318
There he goes into Frederick street.	630.0078794641643
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	1301.018005189481
Might be settling my braces.	1285.1398196742434
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	983.1143450861387
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	408.0085925383601
Want to try in the dark to see.	259.6437619472805
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	424.92085083403043
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	535.9807299865447
Terrible.	238.63253457126893
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	496.9080828590514
Life a dream for him.	331.43426011741013
Where is the justice being born that way?	557.6535661038652
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	2158.7200985328336
Holocaust.	362.3144614049264
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	1313.4470672141863
Dear, dear, dear.	272.26208292189574
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	552.1964417463031
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	1498.885962059779
Solemn as Troy.	815.1956288101435
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	1153.8823628262921
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	2622.0999153624607
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	869.5095325791074
I sentenced him to ten years.	454.6224253217265
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	469.3932204509244
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	771.0044476262269
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	573.0424245505797
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	5425.886060523202

Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	518.4612336293469
Power those judges have.	642.883785140149
Crusty old topers in wigs.	1629.192498144994
Bear with a sore paw.	881.1697535776727
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	532.8300948486109
Hello, placard.	408.86931179549083
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	695.4525129691792
Sixteenth.	362.3144614049264
Today it is.	233.86899247652724
In aid of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital.	828.9181437413466
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	631.3221344295468
Yes.	79.54417819042295
Handel.	316.5108355747976
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	453.65229538749537
No use sticking to him like a leech.	617.467776928207
Wear out my welcome.	763.2821807009267
Sure to know someone on the gate.	415.2978409844355
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	364.59922652127483
First I must.	251.36779392768784
Library.	266.9555776457352
Straw hat in sunlight.	771.3069871981738
Tan shoes.	860.8673651095745
Turnedup trousers.	782.2640802014834
It is.	97.75888083093557
It is.	97.75888083093557
His heart quopped softly.	1178.12421947721
To the right.	123.25733463692804
Museum.	316.5108355747976
Goddesses.	362.3144614049264
He swerved to the right.	211.5096059724875
Is it?	209.01180782614574
Almost certain.	568.7172725945022
Wine in my face.	305.5976211314091
Why did I?	255.8826569509886
Too heady.	868.194556509716
Yes, it is.	88.87777327970124
The walk.	150.44722167674055
Not see.	170.95123581952686
Get on.	157.16342772282397
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	1016.3189069864037
Handsome building.	1082.4834034118442
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	3130.7200271242505
Not following me?	549.4908873892898
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	399.2799523937927
Light in his eyes.	210.67884914459646
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	772.7495798677799
Quick.	205.25706077185902
Cold statues: quiet there.	850.8530624481639
Safe in a minute.	330.71448685283525
No. Didn ’ t see me.	241.2722349923513
After two.	212.81580317221415
Just at the gate.	239.04086813709074
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	1568.7420411463133
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	1726.651412973709
Look for something I.	227.12080512253132
Where did I?	254.52150175619516
Busy looking.	638.7159468670837
He thrust back quick Agendath.	891.5541149916771
Afternoon she said.	333.7744311481088
I am looking for that.	187.16467114968404
Yes, that.	69.55988606059914
Try all pockets.	498.3801994782102
Handker.	362.3144614049264
Trousers.	251.21481667538362
Potato.	287.5691785887357
Purse.	362.3144614049264
Where?	201.5556843520298
Hurry.	238.63253457126893
Walk quietly.	559.6148591681133
Moment more.	445.84360765110347
My heart.	231.2354435558492
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	1098.7448519792579
Ah soap there I yes.	446.6600157151697
Gate.	287.5691785887357
Safe! Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred: — And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	1063.3374876178043
A great poet on a great brother poet.	665.9968767006699
A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.	1381.0941199282938
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	1256.9381758626896
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.	1827.9905256944653
— Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.	513.411984478782
The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts.	2546.1192810257003
One always feels that Goethe ’ s judgments are so true.	1191.1175625019998
True in the larger analysis.	803.9688504677204
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off.	1893.118652667305
Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant ’ s words: heard them: and was gone.	492.3869615751453
Two left.	242.43033591145647
— Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.	1512.1880795537174
— Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with elder ’ s gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation?	1792.313753461615
_The Sorrows of Satan_ he calls it.	923.8103543063504
Smile.	316.5108355747976
First he tickled her Then he patted her Then he passed the female catheter For he was a medical Jolly old medi...	939.6051869076774
— I feel you would need one more for <URL> Seven is dear to the mystic mind.	697.4339845895579

Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	428.7394228467702
He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	409.43045493008924
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	1029.447787569767
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	1632.6485495540053
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	474.1038798077198

France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer ’ s Phæacians.	962.0774996474962
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	1019.0543443126741
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	806.7260838641961
The one about <URL> He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui - même_, don ’ t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	1757.7680008311308

It ’ s so French.	222.17742630658765
The French point of view.	454.72309590767924
_Hamlet ou_...	310.82788565328735
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	631.8829351571513
John Eglinton laughed.	532.5915191495503
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	159.6063598703885
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	1293.8438774700278
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	1520.3514823266275
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	568.4100338651865
Not for nothing was he a butcher ’ s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	768.5276516465332

The devil and the deep sea.	299.9148370189713
— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	546.4190816438935
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	1098.775395678863
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	1772.401189796455
If thou didst ever...	390.8351839647324
— What is a ghost?	257.2824370078814
Stephen said with tingling energy.	626.3526252598891
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	1186.6997393719107
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	2823.901307516347
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning to the world that has forgotten him?	792.8222818188141

John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	1234.3916160920398
Lifted.	362.3144614049264

— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	828.9263568710811
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	1189.2093326277559
The swan of Avon has other thoughts.	1125.545485390489

A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	753.3702209571319
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	511.0506299660998
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	790.7155563696256
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	517.1728323069476
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	865.5791138637136
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	749.8940409531685
Art thou there, truepenny?	1181.6393143386522
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	667.4197214436233
I mean, we have the plays.	233.56742355110882
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	809.1077274090334
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	1155.6925237520752
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	647.6587676394258
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	665.5154674234816

Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	879.1506465871836
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	439.5977665251539
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	635.105414850978
She saw him into and out of the world.	189.08169221510926
She took his first embraces.	497.1148757609282
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	822.7682308565381

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	684.3833271249533
— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	366.95107791067886
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	606.818433394634
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	803.6760098913928
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	981.5591039769207
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	1193.0766538417831
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	904.1849147759762
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	3618.554329905015
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	488.23458783067804
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	721.0391671803632
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	1447.3347415242254
Mr Best ’ s quiet voice said forgetfully.	665.4565544256734
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	653.2104747370896
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	1297.4713501236447
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	453.11211249670856
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	1057.379216510741

The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	1981.0225422647372

Come! — Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	863.173522921762
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	1503.0721380893333

Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses.	1122.9311575462466
We are all looking forward anxiously.	826.6393682016648
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	1047.0280665303096
See this.	204.7008086145749
Remember.	174.18262542580518

Do you think he has genius really?	848.0275060708484
Yeats admired his line: _As in wild earth a Grecian vase_.	2076.9021858439037
Did he?	203.6591032809783
I hope you ’ ll be able to come tonight.	493.7553959779396
Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	481.4166561209077
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	563.2044499238335
Did you hear Miss Mitchell ’ s joke about Moore and Martyn?	1468.9592657187516
That Moore is Martyn ’ s wild oats?	1326.1861903795016
Awfully clever, isn ’ t it?	759.0851065138094

— Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	358.4500590242097
— O, yes.	105.18021416282214
If he considers it important it will go in.	598.0673236334466
We have so much correspondence.	670.4346640606977

Stephen sat down.	274.6886449708236
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	836.1822081237373
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	775.2274159930432
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	568.983334535993
Alarmed face asks me.	1019.9605803644517
Why did he come?	360.9252480025275
Courtesy or an inward light?	1529.4742770407206
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	442.5600376892777
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	1178.017340823081
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters ’ wives.	850.9043910886263

And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	1054.0399013536774
— Yes.	93.55468513203499
So you think...	105.70949508083451
The door closed behind the outgoer.	654.4698399083524
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	2054.582550849395
A vestal ’ s lamp.	444.72877846455754
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	1105.4531681509504
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	1037.7274104476646
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	826.9016513866576

Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	683.0526585985559
— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	554.6536304430846
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	542.3770984639203
Not even so much.	406.4942454345218
Others abide our question.	1907.7751647414145
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	505.4133767781216
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	521.3230696243043
Mr Best pleaded.	639.9105879557471
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	284.73568902546623
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	342.0269821293176
His private papers in the original.	473.40349332232347

Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	752.9956085521645
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	1372.9993154011147
Bear with me.	270.1854813602964
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	3602.88359591455
A basilisk.	363.0901552219435
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	5857.6844852101285
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	839.6057484244463
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	844.3927316613758
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	727.4495056468832
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	460.6195133499542
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	439.5338014780229
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	1274.7954179294945
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	419.09588876738235
I feel Hamlet quite young.	558.5078130736753
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	726.4124474822195
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	801.7083150677528
He is in my father.	151.41683377562262
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	278.42970416432564
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	1557.4290409811676
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	439.9866372966835
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	1592.9009257425678
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	705.7947418802335
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	499.549563775797
Said that.	229.493266085738
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	743.9469260535061
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	1072.451544271709
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	867.0969768233865
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	318.2584419027507
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	1314.7920165672938
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	924.7312146209199
Good Bacon: gone musty.	1377.5751897304335

Booted the twain and staved.	1048.5662451631054
How many miles to Dublin?	814.3825486747553
Three score and ten, sir.	428.6683488719575
Will we be there by candlelight?	882.21480254101
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	472.30850311532106
— Does he?	293.0226860421071
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	904.8584484094808
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	375.4601436889998
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	351.41243314079355
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	1356.2070098774839
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	674.7320618362028
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	769.9878140251252
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	518.7894438432381
Do you know what you are talking about?	516.97194536661
Such an appeal will touch him.	936.8720838077354
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	718.0194504593279
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	1945.932286902527
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	490.4776069422323
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	1653.224087969989
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	2301.647428703482
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	1692.1353841659222
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	1072.35552071086
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	1650.1136938447805
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	1021.2538890318682
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	1225.4795333952015
Dost love, Miriam?	934.8691979298759
Dost love thy man?	1280.2854338170305
— That may be too, Stephen said.	236.44359588195042
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	575.8654109047068
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	783.0345819090638
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	720.5446878538023
Why?	203.35538390318914
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	810.4917306489899
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	1306.244852203323
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	1661.8251284807104
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	1482.2049703346154
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	1097.1240660011788
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	564.4379258143681
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	1113.7407016050947
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	390.6038213847682
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	930.3772835879128
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	1053.6216267708578
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	975.7747704834505
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	809.8636210129856
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	1072.5812958304432
His beaver is up.	417.53970645494616
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	337.88979227046184
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	444.3654578319142
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	1427.860621826206
_Entr ’ acte_.	922.6653477299826
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	799.6720176381724
My telegram.	451.7830531413167
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	708.4216010914166
he asked of Stephen.	113.62684638401004
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	1472.9861847208892
They make him welcome.	404.8259532778733
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	6756.796174127845
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	1661.3544032801487
He lifts his hands.	283.3564944967592
Veils fall.	816.8947914426592
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	1083.0266070013981
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	314.6469592970875
A most instructive discussion.	899.5739612952491
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	311.51312458734515
All sides of life should be represented.	778.596783598812
He smiled on all sides equally.	604.3264931530687
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	681.9119384590175
he said.	56.271385512740096
I seem to know the name.	212.78517676188468
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	1876.9278502375525
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	388.7414519363431
The chap that writes like Synge.	739.4148477387707
Mr Best turned to him.	249.3075990351083
— Haines missed you, he said.	228.81365813026636
Did you meet him?	434.0721080733982
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	241.67716465724172
B.	131.3245447289437
C.	105.94139119590463
He ’ s gone to Gill ’ s to buy Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	637.4951849330482
— I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	299.87961953202876
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	878.4734365430038
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	441.17145238509517
Has no - one made him out to be an Irishman?	653.8858414506316
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	888.3418760641256
— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	566.0532622758312
<URL> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	819.3572028028949
— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	520.4007252888854
the quaker librarian asked.	470.7514030135129
Or Hughie Wills?	3074.182587794536
Mr William Himself.	549.8641038177706
W.	143.78458929436798
H.: who am I?	258.57206677533105
— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	747.4065686183773
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	474.29517363133505
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	320.7072332111808
The light touch.	305.98052633822215
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	1200.5217853457534
Tame essence of Wilde.	1312.8124856678849
You ’ re darned witty.	855.7337503373743
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy ’ s ducats.	1515.9675630815336
How much did I spend?	689.7750495618232
O, a few shillings.	188.1441530868603
For a plump of pressmen.	495.08893901484004
Humour wet and dry.	845.0173270581857
Wit.	362.3144614049264
You would give your five wits for youth ’ s proud livery he pranks in.	1119.7685047872912
Lineaments of gratified desire.	1386.6939339155383
Take her for me.	200.2968066152079

— Do you think it is only a paradox?	487.8022535285695
the quaker librarian was asking.	531.7553208994669
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	1171.7915015991546
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	1253.5384286767846
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	866.0436807576449
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	513.8595145653427
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	1037.475399313308
— Telegram! he said.	226.15972960807284
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	1878.798822291625
Where did you launch it from?	579.6620918989679

Have you drunk the four quid?	765.8521404162144
Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	1009.4726765211914
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	784.6828640768409
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	1062.575643289024
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	1240.48081896819
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	997.0200669798521
Stephen laughed.	205.27192920032437
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	1130.0892723948916
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	358.3905711627411
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	764.4650736321206
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	296.60694198956696
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	470.495057124924
That was your contribution to literature.	564.67328811313
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	1218.1381968049263
— Murder you! he laughed.	332.36273554655486
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	3615.7654018256485

— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	552.1098553665362
—...	25.80284968496271
in which everyone can find his own.	455.5549053456006
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	1144.3603090803995
Yes?	170.29794207213695
What is it?	156.27123387422753
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	339.92950910922883
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	640.112314401968
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	336.6753026449232
Is the gentleman?...	93.07238663883064
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	369.17957583732283
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	300.19642564386373
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	1531.4516345780005
— This gentleman?	393.45325166941484
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	692.6982840272901
Good day, sir.	202.2275173334835
_Kilkenny_...	105.41347367552758
We have certainly...	144.7090121960599
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	1251.3834161715029

Please, sir...	98.87050466821812
The door closed.	309.7171349166031
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	611.0126895929421
He jumped up and snatched the card.	508.72606442916316
— What ’ s his name?	170.76639470067911
Bloom.	52.298406001606715
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	594.9524095396732
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	709.0981256273435
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	860.1661991653644
Every day we must do homage to her.	680.0709841901124
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	579.8618891024146
He knows your old fellow.	357.55835544644697
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	361.71246207703086
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	2259.9486284117766
Venus Kallipyge.	1041.5606143351663
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	1175.6012021943534
— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	694.9943744133079
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	659.3585124992537
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	608.1420183879823
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	1084.5266691343152
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	572.3163028197284
His life was rich.	329.6012019249473
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	829.368486059424
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	1800.0554608782427
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	1267.3049997314683
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	2311.866042046404
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	2547.6989723525217
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	1233.3812875170945
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	874.6581550036282
Cours la Reine.	2278.234907041207
_Encore vingt sous.	3941.5300455217093
Minette?	775.6872792440565
Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	1056.6266401273083
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	1027.9295577300602
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	1285.8116881251574
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	1785.225268969733
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	1480.6736420809227
Do and do.	144.5749469680794
Thing done.	585.7125761313118
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	899.4414787442935
An azured harebell like her veins.	2020.5392811860524
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	549.565104415528
He walks.	207.19638709706186
One life is all.	237.63080367482405
One body.	271.0409163437571
Do. But do.	173.3199214272441
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	776.0823459243794
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	1477.6327038601084
— Whom do you suspect?	926.729323355114
he challenged.	231.9124494103817
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	428.98563146413204
Once spurned twice spurned.	2461.3924920687296
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	659.5451851999361
Love that dare not speak its name.	773.210323108909
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	559.5603539967979
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	2622.830628033952
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	593.5324855906745
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	464.0901271627815
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	678.6855858753684
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	1274.3253564464069
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	321.7576306382242
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	751.1340932346183
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	467.3265125990758
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	350.56754920697784
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	833.2723811957395
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	660.8780600190339
O, yes, mention there is.	206.11568426680952
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	999.5401252335419
Explain you then.	321.19446477015885
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	1571.3567760851488
He faced their silence.	567.950245557491
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	801.1268540082613
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	961.7673259063246
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	1678.508397956081
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	1027.2059437571081
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	11248.59544120012
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	1665.3494215695025
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	692.6254947205923
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	782.873291818664
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	685.8024208438625
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	1121.9807533438207
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	3050.696446220937
Let me think.	271.6590642177563
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	1569.1510929863277
— Do you mean he died so?	478.21594892907467
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	961.8652409379077
I mean...	59.91779063117814
— He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	816.958260735832
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	529.1991408724286
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! — What?	404.671593456771
asked Besteglinton.	550.0452666074208
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	579.8057487987695
The people ’ s William.	241.05119964487426
Dowden, Highfield house...	293.5913252153708
— Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	1573.82023690789
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	524.234165797072
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those <URL> Lovely! Catamite.	914.129330226391
— The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	1418.223834703242
Steadfast John replied severe: — The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	1526.881398512744
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	650.3492296923123
Sayest thou so?	1203.00601645613
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	453.7280652267019
— And the sense of property, Stephen said.	220.18433938701992
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	576.4370170213117
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	1223.8050453423796
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	3294.2624498655982
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	1127.7416002727266
How else could Aubrey ’ s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	1926.4269708284532
All events brought grist to his mill.	1272.6927476285643
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	1154.8228900319962
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love ’ s Labour Lost_.	1440.7712766188567
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	1407.4425931310489
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter ’ s theory of equivocation.	1092.2957040715282
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	2737.1739886821597
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’ s.	1303.0761176209455
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	3125.405345022323
I think you ’ re getting on very nicely.	490.8438886681779
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	1126.873508188017
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, <URL> — Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	869.83024034334
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	979.5871627427761
_Sufflaminandus <URL> — He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	1061.635654869359
— A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	616.014271928502
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	1320.5844781643927
_Amplius.	316.5108355747976
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter <URL> — Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	4060.6642393670113
— _Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	1724.6195535017025
There he keened a wailing rune.	1251.9268335594913
— _Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! _ It ’ s destroyed we are from this day! It ’ s destroyed we are surely! All smiled their smiles.	1398.4566750928825
— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	1050.2134039917098
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	743.9791184537023
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	1202.5148335190847
Accusations are made in anger.	871.9637601345569
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	1005.4818035444704
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	3248.770838575777
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.	1051.4543073900443
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	1691.369830955573
— Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	814.8347993908214
— Which will?	365.55520352696135
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	1445.2317421698338
We are getting mixed.	610.5145477344066
— The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will ’ s widow, is the will to die.	450.56057461705683
_ — Requiescat! _ Stephen prayed.	425.1847684474754
What of all the will to do?	160.8409257743454
It has vanished long ago...	352.09510789713096
— She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes.	1013.976221646461
In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul.	1062.3044606210597
Venus has twisted her lips in prayer.	933.8205768393301
Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.	1053.798713722592
It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.	1429.9223715242972
— History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_.	1525.8944796167702
The ages succeed one another.	923.0705574108578
But we have it on high authority that a man ’ s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family.	630.4320150683423
I feel that Russell is right.	351.4177238962687
What do we care for his wife or father?	540.64165639991
I should say that only family poets have family lives.	1020.1075405396599

Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what ’ s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	796.6080582987598
Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.	793.4388639207349
The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	914.1132649234705
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare ’ s reverence, the angel of the world.	663.2473941497902
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney ’ s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?	1781.3285878603233

He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	2365.480421061257
— Why?	189.1476710358997
Stephen answered himself.	285.1251102871565
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	434.1797736837086
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	1817.5032921659206
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	916.3698611794428
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	805.8225598259999
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	748.7415507103688
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	797.8053219314393
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	1057.2124179626512
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	684.102760632574
Age has not withered it.	919.8032995540384
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	608.3504320044115
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	911.862499154338
He laughed to free his mind from his mind ’ s bondage.	459.8122034183406
Judge Eglinton summed up.	1548.5855722065521
— The truth is midway, he affirmed.	513.1904041831781
He is the ghost and the prince.	175.24668643461723
He is all in all.	107.16956638640566
— He is, Stephen said.	106.29775995917137
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	506.5477434971631
All in all.	105.998046641534
In _Cymbeline, _ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold.	734.8661277563933
He acts and is acted on.	416.5812657972901
Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen.	1257.1042391428348
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	2441.1627323423704
— Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.	2384.0331835873512
O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	1233.621943682914
— And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	1167.3294671777253
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?) _ is right.	897.7694682933267
After God Shakespeare has created most.	1180.8201811196307
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	684.2659392056154
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	533.8963389323252
The motion is ended.	562.1547778437575
Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet <URL> A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.	1286.8241215089483
And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced.	1143.543868035436
If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa ’ s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	911.2918052174039
Strong curtain.	985.0472112756765
He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible.	510.9045066625218

The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	965.0509308379972
_ — Eureka! _ Buck Mulligan cried.	510.7319400359392
_Eureka! _ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton ’ s desk.	1300.5934864716673

You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	760.0347378236953
Do you believe your own theory?	975.7970417440008
— No, Stephen said promptly.	244.6483211996002
— Are you going to write it?	355.2276570989199
Mr Best asked.	298.8661942387693
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	708.0824944145007
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	2007.1684234017996
— Well, in that case, he said, I don ’ t see why you should expect payment for it since you don ’ t believe it yourself.	459.0152415811475
Dowden believes there is some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	1267.1672217338532
Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	1257.8208584011077
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	404.0307259814282
But he believes his theory.	539.9445179662513
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	448.20392165018336
That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve?	570.6888229956336
Who helps to believe?	813.2618838108893

— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	557.3275328867846
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	1311.3364902234944
He broke away.	292.5132078810357
— Come, Kinch.	188.01384433442928
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	485.57862082539793
Come, Kinch.	196.12836228543122
You have eaten all we left.	511.73279333308886
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	809.2728405928912
Stephen rose.	185.48412651027135
Life is many days.	595.4944906082696
This will end.	391.8677932723721
— We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	499.89162339704404
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	2038.2303387623665
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	1250.5831705202959
— Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	517.3978383607628
I ’ ll be there.	140.39469671354945
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	422.3472102372336

Swill till eleven.	1058.0360375651394
Lubber...	105.41347367552758
Stephen followed a lubber...	202.13735889328245
One day in the national library we had a discussion.	565.2143231452519
Shakes.	238.63253457126893
After.	123.09458315445424
His lub back: I followed.	545.4956181049844
I gall his kibe.	653.7090806498223
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	941.8290076949105
What have I learned?	390.196392623773
Of them?	311.1433997689394

— O please do, sir...	140.15475155436494
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding: — A pleased bottom.	1563.6942124321483
The turnstile.	315.47202731874313

The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	2930.9128528698843
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won ’ t you wed a wife?	969.7930084645908
He spluttered to the air: — O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	1868.887863953336
We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers ’ hall.	421.9694790080509

— Longworth and M ’ Curdy Atkinson were there...	469.55723597711983
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling: I hardly hear the purlieu cry Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by Before my thoughts begin to run On F.	2194.053977413946
M ’ Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	1440.2015883719307
Jest on.	304.0069421783639
Know thyself.	941.156257994358
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	596.2659732788889
I halt.	209.2267445885008
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	1290.8606442711457
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	858.8613462176852
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	1232.1254131198702
A laugh tripped over his lips.	691.6641951143379
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	812.9951965106643
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	1063.7538465370499
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	668.2184181041192
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	721.5264150224351
One thinks of Homer.	664.7292276712524
He stopped at the stairfoot.	363.80150516030284
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	1997.9707136563861
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	872.1319976713198
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	1565.152923224903
But listen.	303.10744564533195
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	2077.6196218815653
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	679.209038229192
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	567.5207985403341
Part.	266.9555776457352
The moment is now.	211.3822491397961
Where then?	288.2293079905735
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	1404.3345191313947
Why?	203.35538390318914
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	488.3364634943463
My will: his will that fronts me.	426.30490900849156
Seas between.	607.46353825842
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	503.75469597352037
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	340.8829147856689
The portico.	349.1271888048592
Here I watched the birds for augury.	715.9578756147449
Ængus of the birds.	295.01868115106925
They go, they come.	202.32194265084692
Last night I flew.	550.4456733806744
Easily flew.	958.7555812941006
Men wondered.	941.156257994358
Street of harlots after.	563.3483437019443
A creamfruit melon he held to me.	702.844578164871
In. You will see.	187.949292569993
— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	818.6865143297491
Did you see his eye?	377.4808298969709
He looked upon you to lust after you.	399.27387490951895
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	674.6783640486652
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	434.9157133671627
Get thee a breechpad.	886.9507196451709

Day.	194.13978749570623
Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	1094.2963580372304
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	633.4802100906545
They followed.	228.67953223541693
Speak on.	222.26265099466133
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	1401.2258558052808
No birds.	308.3540619449693
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	1445.0109013469792
Cease to strive.	838.2181245041321
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.	1495.8546976773966
Laud we the gods And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our bless ’ d altars.	2354.9888554799104
The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	550.8251388159507
J.	78.32022695006061
reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	1161.2939998633715
Five to three.	264.001398019685
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	702.2786157082485
What was that boy ’ s name again?	302.5653112865393
Dignam.	108.73059404071822
Yes.	79.54417819042295
_Vere dignum et iustum <URL> Brother Swan was the person to see.	2598.8883765294217
Mr Cunningham ’ s letter.	232.0015715544063
Yes.	79.54417819042295
Oblige him, if possible.	403.0077678686768
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	1852.1217956251608
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	1939.8080394706956
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	1221.3223450652997
J.	78.32022695006061
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	546.3421383257404
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	1062.0524064112437
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	867.1962876925475
And you, father?	161.8056398003339
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	1014.3692100404407
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	550.2253351769976
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	587.405252210439
Was that so?	301.9884233001328
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	650.5417771097032
And Mr Sheehy himself?	647.0445916621929
Still in London.	269.0927138618126
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	276.88708140844415
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	806.90850875087
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	989.4061774019976
O, yes: a very great success.	330.045246909131
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	825.3068748708195
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	567.2308800413844
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	841.8489056735443
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	633.8197907488258
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	880.4086173084802
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	1286.061081281384
A zealous man, however.	433.2316606576275
Really he was.	218.4152660064262
And really did great good in his way.	397.0243825092493
Beyond a doubt.	508.81460442517886
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	216.41836005224994
Of good family too would one think it?	740.2785817019637
Welsh, were they not?	348.1915839960248
O, lest he forget.	313.83770036577573
That letter to father provincial.	537.6595529300955
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	384.9108143099893
The little house.	192.0437185573168
Aha.	205.25706077185902
And were they good boys at school?	668.9295020327429
O.	56.514357636516635
That was very good now.	282.43115943605454
And what was his name?	237.5594826294069
Jack Sohan.	791.4149235410555
And his name?	203.61965571007437
Ger.	316.5108355747976
Gallaher.	211.88278239180926
And the other little man?	251.67513212287307
His name was Brunny Lynam.	946.3098040764429
O, that was a very nice name to have.	203.5941398973529
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	986.823065999294
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	408.1640502065818
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	579.1760280956597
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	448.4518999366458
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	1126.8733607583777
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	1427.5406320885884
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	1791.157594713194
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	648.8857248759051
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	1131.8705211800443
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	615.6372468974723
A fine carriage she had.	413.69153327249643
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	495.05537929652206
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	252.59550458761927
what should he say?...	123.8191806791654
such a queenly mien.	799.6097948628483
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	1146.8861855661685
The reverend T.	416.12517587990243
R.	181.1572307024632
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	313.19574397463606
The incumbent they called him.	459.16993071184794
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	460.59105554320365
But one should be charitable.	643.042276797644
Invincible ignorance.	1424.6282766826969
They acted according to their lights.	945.2195417714029
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	849.3150913234986
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	589.6233108211301
Surely, there ought to be.	326.77016108703737
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	1687.1414447714026
All raised untidy caps.	1550.5801064052953
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	1548.4389111507037
Christian brother boys.	1127.5368409680036
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	770.3267398155882
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	816.1473662773288
For aged and virtuous females.	1210.952737423682
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	684.3839588897736
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	1583.2925248738497
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	2064.0265502418633
And now it was an office or something.	337.4397257255868
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	1023.9669358326618
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	1815.7759684006446
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	1315.7977642059022
In America those things were continually happening.	1955.1353556303677
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	720.0600963715791
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	614.4847683619945
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	1557.5107599976982
They saluted him and were saluted.	445.4476725269646
Father Conmee passed H.	726.0752814788142
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	1528.9963498564316
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	1161.5593194533774
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	801.1491004008528
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	1485.2442487813219
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	1010.6479307839055
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	1194.5010683875068
J.	78.32022695006061
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	1260.9760874612095
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	3202.4032335668385
C.	105.94139119590463
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	679.7945586923375
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	2897.106554202354
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	1167.4384941729231
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	1967.6896671885663
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	844.4355711272169
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	2273.929276130318
It was a peaceful day.	322.6820587714856
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	937.7259510915693
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	553.3615098357562
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	388.0476285446953
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	2129.8298558946985
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	590.2254690368223
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	676.5043219331757
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	684.7127324825753
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	690.1116477126463
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	811.446506887623
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	2531.4430558941103
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	767.7115257690575
J.	78.32022695006061
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	535.5176855055212
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	2050.295449918235
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	994.3843052678931
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	423.2742446502521
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	545.1396871331476
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	942.7689404661745
The Malahide road was quiet.	608.6626645894204
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	524.092365439518
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	1337.7001250480496
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	2184.397300229103
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	386.9339255994319
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	1348.2067089440968
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	951.361880260157
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	1247.8774459819408
Who could know the truth?	440.8159775787828
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	2268.3797214058386
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	862.6294130858483
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	283.76275127081936
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	669.6484106694655
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	791.2197181740003
He was humane and honoured there.	472.8009027184037
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	537.016573206924
It was a charming day.	278.5448289453407
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	1563.654833858861
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	1004.1065185590357
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	244.0387764736719
A just and homely word.	459.2435633674028
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	1219.0412941523653
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	1746.6703912249543
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	411.43560841089203
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	616.0656469131267
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	1161.9177352809886
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	1022.7218300245285
Nones.	362.3144614049264
He should have read that before lunch.	551.4423739931202
But lady Maxwell had come.	779.5953182490013
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	1225.402333718715
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	2095.024582435638
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	1403.8982514436323
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	1122.865183203511
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	4211.598463536359
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	893.8692701378435
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	623.7700931889891
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	886.7416503170975
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	1610.0600839988417
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	1317.0245316082005
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	369.0176498327384
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	238.704230442321
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	349.63177576933606
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	256.583156166569
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	1830.9819166493812
— What ’ s the best news?	270.6950912249954
he asked.	89.54079260770219
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	775.7877350944083
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	841.2718045050118
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	1193.7668033526613
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	585.8385184303814
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	811.7446215149754
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	1770.273105028641
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	670.5602962104106
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	2159.3546388839595
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	1337.601637120715
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	404.938093294397
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	1698.7295053572561
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	726.8069383062085
It fell on the path.	302.32785672706933
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	427.37930878699393
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	1108.6613688483965
— Did you put in the books?	322.83237728651443
Boody asked.	351.44763012211405
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	2789.8482146042893
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	307.64791389012754
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	2450.424156294721
— Where did you try?	427.60617862016
Boody asked.	351.44763012211405
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	201.12421999842707
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	846.903683546503
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	635.8048437902205
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	764.9367864348894
— What ’ s in the pot?	181.20037342495397
she asked.	123.14808526326003
— Shirts, Maggy said.	401.1190398432361
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	901.4415836923633
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	483.76839467609784
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	1200.5515792565586
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	401.1190398432361
Katey asked.	367.837439341884
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	664.6617549063467
The lacquey rang his bell.	780.4885584156415
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	670.9379694910951
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	1495.7478350821905
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	1030.62804796287
Where ’ s Dilly?	335.4385652710602
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	453.938714324777
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	956.9427591340888
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	1630.9252158715453
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	2266.851607329177
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	1543.3795451911485
— Put these in first, will you?	353.8438513407538
he said.	56.271385512740096
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	219.54977887217572
And the fruit on top.	290.56433768541024
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	441.28846861163595
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	2034.912307160957
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	2096.819786334001
H.	146.9113160121431
E.	145.31432739865093
L.	148.5809057155056
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	1237.8293478104117
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	818.2600684529984
— Can you send them by tram?	693.4315499716683
Now?	249.63927796125353
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	1809.8603578144537
— Certainly, sir.	199.36020142045913
Is it in the city?	232.47881230950665
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	232.5528486648187
Ten minutes.	511.0781031243115
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	903.8060992005593
— Will you write the address, sir?	394.33360725535726
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	614.0689778755373
— Send it at once, will you?	330.2858556970437
he said.	56.271385512740096
It ’ s for an invalid.	307.3759799048678
— Yes, sir.	120.02413405031919
I will, sir.	107.5462390876999
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	1033.758095240813
— What ’ s the damage?	239.9206003266523
he asked.	89.54079260770219
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	1046.6378416075024
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	581.6505318219802
A young pullet.	555.9834852056579
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	863.4376947657746
he asked gallantly.	375.07173870037917
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	825.8933991518612
— Yes, sir, she said.	127.11975371658
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	3959.480982479507
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	827.5624631205174
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	611.2888782377283
he asked roguishly.	406.75471279460044
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	1100.9892739884644
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	962.6130267661329
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	1610.7834483007898
Palefaces.	316.5108355747976
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	1484.166060217434
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	1221.9983071359836
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	5457.266169301726
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	28212.72684372634
È peccato.	1694.178082865129
Perchè la sua voce...	1202.225199850254
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	6103.532640833013
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	588.174542087701
_Ma, dia retta a me.	844.3484658548213
Ci rifletta_.	1694.178082865129
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	2334.1817954487224
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	798.8885371162377
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	1162.3299555096773
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	585.80712370402
Human eyes.	404.0819387646239
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	1526.2799298403695
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	903.4946670604515
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	4529.673941657384
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	609.9670320961941
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	1730.6753852124905
_Scusi, eh?	653.9595108529467
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	2913.363681546598
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	2342.849558070491
Too much mystery business in it.	632.8784442892156
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	284.83282788687933
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	1382.9713442741909
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	912.8180411818104
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	941.3887891120751

Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	1555.7375633286736
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	1312.8029860326608
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	281.49978708143266
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	295.54259799257153
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	550.8922071985576
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	1108.696798009082
They kick out grand.	567.9827476723302
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	715.1546169235666
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	828.7471746654934
— Hello.	145.84565589323472
Yes, sir.	114.45503538811168
No, sir.	108.84438005578416
Yes, sir.	114.45503538811168
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	371.64693958138406
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	441.326827028145
All right, sir.	182.43292106331054
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	477.7294925652894
A quarter after.	311.2057509734756
Yes, sir.	114.45503538811168
Twentyseven and six.	453.51826020793635
I ’ ll tell him.	160.34154249383184
Yes: one, seven, six.	226.09532334128843
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	1090.8143142482295
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	535.5805161171105
Mr Lenehan, yes.	169.33506735865788
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	240.09557002683889
No, sir.	108.84438005578416
Yes, sir.	114.45503538811168
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	371.64693958138406
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	1431.651446440396
— Who ’ s that?	148.60627206994045
Ned Lambert asked.	453.2625973325186
Is that Crotty?	783.1922967306855
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	1078.1043867187163
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	303.5543121625566
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	1700.5788362101846
Come on.	117.37628846619381
Mind your steps there.	587.5439978695293
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	919.0460816278772
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	1357.9484966411699
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	623.9563991334942
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	381.58988309274025
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	1622.3755387910053
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	559.1187275040535
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	782.1646963752123
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	369.5332807664596
— No, Ned.	138.46392809536025
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	962.4414801598095
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	248.46963850587025
That ’ s quite right, sir.	221.0983873720409
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	323.8842162179835
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	374.63061461685714
Bring the camera whenever you like.	788.6300942831621
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	684.7541552391367
You can take it from here or from here.	389.39395982296435
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	927.8070199619838
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	640.1103007718499
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	400.9364467007564
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	360.64736317532163
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	368.23340954438845
Drop in whenever you like.	471.74279235772445
Next week, say.	448.3608370176515
Can you see?	337.89133140061915
— Yes, yes.	124.78398552172627
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	419.3741117742372
Very pleased to have met you.	519.6155527392632
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	590.0320804427739
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	917.7605553942496
With J.	185.68454185014122
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	1652.6464977208243
He stood to read the card in his hand.	250.77872107388612
— The reverend Hugh C.	566.3554314308085
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	920.4439746567917
Nice young chap he is.	410.2373056980424
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	382.08144274231915
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	256.78910891341553
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	1327.7881332005647
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	480.15222518887765
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Molloy said.	179.20605057117575
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	524.6656758774561
— God! he cried.	187.11580264482566
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	722.8685180394035
You know that one?	255.30795463332183
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	540.1792179088595
What?	128.2987952047132
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	247.32377772527252
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	499.44668087933326
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	457.50130203975226
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	1858.3932121662358
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	1097.1456660838003
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	272.5900657517342
What is it?	156.27123387422753
What ’ s the trouble?	184.2652053022197
Wait awhile.	435.98881445767694
Hold hard.	419.5064570953314
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	786.3479252108608
— Chow! he said.	235.6479506453497
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	631.7145336431456
J.	78.32022695006061
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	251.9645703657317
cold night before...	145.19035139624387
blast your soul...	209.08395755942155
night before last...	124.98590734757444
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	159.16870493733708
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	249.80435676029893
— I was...	42.18061148589299
Glasnevin this morning...	196.03637965367827
poor little...	80.0056994013847
what do you call him...	128.5596602441957
Chow!...	112.12263022861588
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	1805.1598528528582
— See?	229.7413659562348
he said.	56.271385512740096
Say it ’ s turn six.	363.4999273332272
In here, see.	154.2741361762967
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	698.9564345933044
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	716.0553002592513
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	1763.0824198295531
— See?	229.7413659562348
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	535.9024851694601
The impact.	315.47202731874313
Leverage, see?	396.9673924133626
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	570.5943298915179
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	694.1713057424129
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	586.0305927562647
— See?	229.7413659562348
Tom Rochford said.	434.33410651348066
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	701.902788697103
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	331.3402187630245
One good turn deserves another.	1040.9717052832348
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	348.5673958210508
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	463.0455324054158
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	591.430230705868
When you two begin...	205.26101974738637
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	957.9159122939344
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	564.1477181218464
he asked.	89.54079260770219
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	288.26956654415153
See you later.	386.36020323957354
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	176.54455731033715
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	196.30531345491275
The drain, you mean.	321.89474226203987
— Drain?	516.2668553868497
Lenehan said.	129.67082121396842
It was down a manhole.	320.7164971701225
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	1692.0845615227997
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	1400.8013775275192
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	956.7226596189234
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	704.9666450221207
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	601.9559962047332
— The act of a hero, he said.	178.26407145158115
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	1271.9948674794837
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	174.9163777462042
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	763.2007632732024
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	399.75833451497186
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	1279.0709517214902
— After three, he said.	168.78431233877592
Who ’ s riding her?	341.1012448957216
— O.	72.39829502080939
Madden, Lenehan said.	203.06596996008187
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	1620.9281947169172
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	1334.2324697728523
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	987.8878049520401
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	497.63223025622716
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	1007.3746751741008
Through here.	323.0937895832248
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	591.1633148078386
— There he is, Lenehan said.	159.23110007383593
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	437.82424409875017
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	315.36491802996477
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	436.5447359671274
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	429.1466944018006
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	652.4043004755897
Astronomy it was about.	291.81066215139043
Lenehan laughed.	300.52369202663357
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	395.96470684855876
Come over in the sun.	188.78217312829463
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	1011.0475301778575
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	775.5968497301031
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	801.4128362824549
The annual dinner, you know.	364.4712610149219
Boiled shirt affair.	1802.4816021404229
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	873.2340638295414
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	693.8300026319558
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	254.44347397950733
My missus sang there once.	928.1696193759099
— Did she?	247.93385826577008
Lenehan said.	129.67082121396842
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	1915.993975544224
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	889.427145155405
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	248.94603823462842
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	1731.9099458604803
Bloom and the wife were there.	149.5815507542102
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	1550.076928405387
Fast and furious it was.	457.94940068637635
After liquids came solids.	2161.665469079991
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	1532.0609917379802
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	196.30531345491275
The year the missus was there...	162.3253480013418
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	1211.7300505989467
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	248.94603823462842
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	848.612098362508
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	874.8525280930677
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	300.7526918947153
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	1818.4653062012983
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	1030.3676041083656
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	1033.5324080947455
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	681.477219128483
Like that.	126.01486411951868
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	778.9372226662258
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	737.6107681448674
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	433.43584505807655
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	518.4123829244232
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	616.1729091835019
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	222.1442433234116
He knows them all, faith.	260.9326020473964
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	447.8677189491974
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	426.9602435042865
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	601.6053228067348
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	826.3223991002774
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	297.6322084021394
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	760.7507513524821
Lenehan walked on again.	325.3949644460992
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	1278.6397032601883
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	544.2625112443625
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	325.18853310020205
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	198.8142977771839
you know...	51.39844704614948
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	276.98087119631407
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	2406.719490913858
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	2634.091770556076
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	368.78357008402037
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	435.97715284688667
Child born every minute somewhere.	1745.4802532982744
Mrs Purefoy.	318.0607575443009
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	1856.6833132437523
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	174.7794495634502
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	993.4185907143601
— Them are two good ones, he said.	416.66408406624015
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	644.0075064251824
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	976.396510720127
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	2116.5938555686175
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	262.9740706504263
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	2853.1126279186283
Know the kind that is.	221.08721032619658
Had it?	279.54924021865986
Yes.	79.54417819042295
He opened it.	175.7065274012111
Thought so.	302.1828570034174
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	548.5605284745226
Listen: the man.	169.47239239353908
Got her it once.	269.1027332757559
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	665.4789180245436
More in her line.	276.22521970658994
Let us see.	288.6837629480025
He read where his finger opened.	532.1012073215245
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	457.0823598080382
This.	116.60358879185429
Here.	114.12190415134765
Try.	199.38933213025123
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	1371.9295019543506
Take this.	244.63979271292283
The end.	143.02981707335883
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	816.4371802353556
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	2390.2614834045453
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	1338.9463302127203
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	1454.5939324607637
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	3848.8898910781973
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	1576.2290101359388
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	1318.2727591790929
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	1838.4274858472063
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	2140.106944017178
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	1365.9907287141202
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	1229.414433318121
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	1114.2430573929453
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	1285.6706717850593
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	951.9083405428079
Mr Bloom beheld it.	277.5811893805956
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	432.6846804698378
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	1773.7991520823432
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	281.85728701919317
That ’ s a good one.	143.85728688886647
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	501.313079507524
Four and nine.	325.443018134112
Those lovely curtains.	945.8468511469438
Five shillings.	452.7881384473445
Cosy curtains.	1082.4834034118442
Selling new at two guineas.	913.1786898361131
Any advance on five shillings?	1694.0734436800506
Going for five shillings.	642.0463446728388
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	1709.9300677334338
J.	78.32022695006061
A.	53.193264159879526
Jackson, W.	377.0216271687112

Munro and H.	457.47972015344885
T.	156.1165688701983
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	1498.7231946767845
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	632.9781646410917
He halted near his daughter.	424.82492180880797
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	142.67744517716136
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	373.992774148465
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	1011.5194912426108
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	1573.8992511501458
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	440.95896189881637
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	278.31266922089026
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	486.8611039846156
Do you know what you look like?	431.1741857748537
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	963.3208671613845
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	234.5538935133885
All the people are looking at you.	286.7704542964194
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	909.9458397309414
— Did you get any money?	517.5985449201459
Dilly asked.	302.0301236430312
— Where would I get money?	414.46077325289696
Mr Dedalus said.	153.90091348932694
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	756.8982638942191
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	270.62869572816646
— How do you know that?	278.60570340167357
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	302.3423417286398
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	654.1363996386849
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	275.6241507396495
Were you in the Scotch house now?	485.3664999514074
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	897.210863485075
Here.	114.12190415134765
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	258.071834297881
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	327.5531806177358
Give me more than that.	316.2871620339207
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	605.7106533104909
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	232.86667714152892
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	2116.0150816133264
But wait awhile.	554.0660290409584
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	440.46960242123436
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	610.0116458225566
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	669.7135397323235
He ’ s dead.	119.4784246896258
The man upstairs is dead.	419.0218473631938
He left her and walked on.	189.67139353538005
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	890.8229957426888
— Well, what is it?	178.93293659555914
he said, stopping.	145.87448389526133
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	1322.5128899060658
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	761.0788908528581
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	1055.2080510779308
— Watch him, he said.	146.64429815450794
It ’ s instructive.	233.47176281526205
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	307.5854077686862
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	309.9165474150529
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	463.76669036672735
Look, there ’ s all I have.	153.7313622088882
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	758.0542498138451
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	988.1386575395716
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	528.8734130484665
Dilly said.	189.8090582963595
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	374.27723183434847
— I will, he said gravely.	162.87658615471932
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	442.2345609081086
I ’ ll try this one now.	300.3883552525542
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	486.6810945929251
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	452.2878844476875
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	478.8532294527951
I ’ ll be home shortly.	362.57441163435124
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	379.5562725512523
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	1262.6002981593522
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	408.9903709077713
The lacquey banged loudly.	1337.1078048961194
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	1251.4568035157424
Got round him all right.	352.39444477660703
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	469.94204386482005
First rate, sir.	392.63565844548435
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	582.8913801804472
How are things going?	560.6748417083099
Just keeping alive.	999.8559877660821
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	782.2997099964642
Yes, indeed.	170.31597943835072
Good for the country.	189.0367583153848
Those farmers are always grumbling.	1884.6890686841878
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	679.3726278932568
Yes, sir.	114.45503538811168
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	4943.531813661814
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	1009.9045382731994
And heartrending scenes.	1000.2239878612618
Men trampling down women and children.	1105.5644959177635
Most brutal thing.	997.1474403877465
What do they say was the cause?	357.4549952060885
Spontaneous combustion.	1347.3302386213154
Most scandalous revelation.	2165.0046941328624
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	1266.8753122094747
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	459.72830815484184
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	474.99346589686724
You know why?	437.7167645727742
Palm oil.	992.211662986586
Is that a fact?	294.58195823896796
Without a doubt.	469.18197221790285
Well now, look at that.	195.76470963769052
And America they say is the land of the free.	317.37107707305626
I thought we were bad here.	402.70211180483705
I smiled at him.	163.6474822635024
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	279.04761646223665
_What is it?	400.45294956550447
The sweepings of every country including our own.	1063.608426251821
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	293.5432129494722
Graft, my dear sir.	468.4750600215353
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	341.86766187037597
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	746.4937303964339
Dress does it.	429.6811836970166
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	848.2612509624067
Bowls them over.	463.01968013300376
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	315.58803837893595
How are things?	440.0428840685018
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	357.18465344415665
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	1250.9837184413984
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	770.0020998694451
Scott of Dawson street.	685.5390323808908
Never built under three guineas.	1335.7399003579098
Fits me down to the ground.	364.72340501543124
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	1751.1361459011923
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	840.909120006877
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	905.3626522766195
Knight of the road.	270.94099764546974
Gentleman.	287.5691785887357
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	466.0312679283212
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	535.1983974498175
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	1151.8186549344944
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	733.9103695202718
High colour, of course.	280.6718662545688
Grizzled moustache.	930.2740099866628
Returned Indian officer.	2223.602899733117
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	1858.007775930924
Is that Ned Lambert ’ s brother over the way, Sam?	562.0031376866455
What?	128.2987952047132
Yes.	79.54417819042295
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	193.88179329868052
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	356.10869864715414
Damn like him.	243.3903598226797
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	2179.959131558996
Good drop of gin, that was.	331.26802327567185
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	1847.3282349143876
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	1108.108003254721
Greasy black rope.	1251.3894886290745
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant ’ s wife drove by in her noddy.	797.2780251512701
Bad times those were.	548.900583400748
Well, well.	136.19881271582273
Over and done with.	256.1865889180274
Great topers too.	846.4780270565587
Fourbottle men.	587.8232862821714
Let me see.	222.1131400297458
Is he buried in saint Michan ’ s?	671.087407270134
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	572.0751793879939
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	519.7194009323875
Dignam is there now.	240.44480590593926
Went out in a puff.	411.54765020255786
Well, well.	136.19881271582273
Better turn down here.	518.3474383518089
Make a detour.	592.5953128783026
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	1586.7100850545607
Damn dangerous thing.	1070.8774432806424
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	1593.4168978776352
Runaway horse.	753.9178292569198
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton ’ s office, led his wife over O ’ Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	963.6821270016025
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	1169.5081939567954
Times of the troubles.	315.6443794204375
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	479.97350050051324
Gaming at Daly ’ s.	510.076062363876
No cardsharping then.	564.1641332794945
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	619.4981268213021
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	4965.766985167583
Stables behind Moira house.	1771.145110888708
Damn good gin that was.	561.5651274901707
Fine dashing young nobleman.	2307.7610517443422
Good stock, of course.	259.80417810447267
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	824.5507627518774
Course they were on the wrong side.	421.77003580715956
They rose in dark and evil days.	524.8377738751158
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	933.335055173227
They were gentlemen.	328.6731980775504
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	1905.9059930921876
Masterly rendition.	1530.8627101488164
_At the siege of Ross did my father <URL> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	1539.472274896641
Frockcoats.	362.3144614049264
Cream sunshades.	1287.2969652097265
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	1489.3251138472817
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	873.1110729129636
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	1424.1990434122622
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	752.2783199796511
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	2055.01650106018
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	1539.1202390366605
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	866.9133121705265
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	1308.2006916591688
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	1325.6107178622688
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	2294.9679734931256
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	942.4725041247073
A long and seafed silent rut.	1009.0056738436801
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	1624.2638624931099
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	961.0069262150942
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	3123.4092322777324
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	1106.0566493151098
The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes.	1101.6340636302011
A lore of drugs.	596.4001828245729
Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.	1933.926950378119
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	1453.298738565513
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	1494.3749028242098
Beingless beings.	1238.6312932739854
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	940.768145688054
Your heart you sing of.	358.5684800254453
I between them.	138.2842064034664
Where?	201.5556843520298
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	1152.7559871633678
Shatter them, one and both.	285.5009066510239
But stun myself too in the blow.	613.7173889118218
Shatter me you who can.	455.70603699221715
Bawd and butcher were the words.	506.09671215493154
I say! Not yet awhile.	507.9897564291981
A look around.	293.14521926600236
Yes, quite true.	270.19467824995553
You say right, sir.	226.0973489045217
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	1072.1833394178004
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	1747.0572145653025
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	3131.95873941739
The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	2491.287050991974

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	1018.3270606673915
How are things?	440.0428840685018
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	357.18465344415665
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	1390.186402989458
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	1584.6833968354174
— What ’ s the best news?	270.6950912249954
Mr Dedalus said.	153.90091348932694
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	366.0235391693901
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	805.3162491964067
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	253.0978213138293
Who is it?	195.83769443195072
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	909.7371062213205
— With a broken back, is it?	253.0472143413743
Mr Dedalus asked.	223.16591218670712
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	356.3741077653564
Reuben of that ilk.	415.29185231486593
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	361.28922248183426
All I want is a little time.	253.23911679914127
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	621.768232798143
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	202.8997760343123
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	797.7136319725469
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	891.6370732167683
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	208.6549269526583
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	1739.3301323075364
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	1381.0947537126078
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	669.4501496902951
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	362.7890131742348
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	1309.6127531008665
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	504.22362033990004
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	1016.6554752909908
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	707.4048164168973
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	539.8773062222631
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	376.21299431109736
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	1002.7489711825891
Father Cowley asked.	407.040958477593
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	2084.461530174669
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	835.419697518722
— Aw! he said.	249.70058587557816
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	337.8105786973412
— What about that?	178.6149414217959
Ben Dollard said.	309.2402159459984
Not too dusty?	802.058242227452
What?	128.2987952047132
He turned to both.	199.65410626966573
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	402.7255860951801
The reverend Hugh C.	705.0140199187302
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	874.890332654518
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	252.25984473152752
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	601.4252420629575
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	594.8899754461647
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	333.7027307214983
Come along.	239.65289789135838
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	572.0477879938926
Wait awhile...	146.50558058585523
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	301.17722519528235
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	623.3028305704569
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	1669.7680946670334
— What few days?	435.93150955683933
he boomed.	231.9124494103817
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	1866.4151285564772
— He has, Father Cowley said.	236.61028474045366
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	502.9932470612581
The landlord has the prior claim.	968.1620063492869
I gave him all the particulars.	263.38689878875897
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	942.1523144945724
Love is the name?	267.32165485276744
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	236.61414580310802
The reverend Mr Love.	412.84700655887104
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	273.82918008307354
But are you sure of that?	252.3689770473121
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	805.7074412204456
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	1007.1664908638187
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	540.3342971978025
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	713.1380920668086
The policeman touched his forehead.	775.5479631606153
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	475.16533119499275
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	989.9949554789888
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	687.6334105473951
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	424.74287557572825
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	477.2078381477228
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	933.1158270155038
— Boyd?	434.1269480091095
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	635.7311885683863
Touch me not.	279.67584600287574
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	1078.3313058442336
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	2508.2072507290695
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	2572.991021009151
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	728.2973732718966
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	422.6703378593788
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	424.8796383043069
And put down the five shillings too.	387.67382227562445
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	518.5209830458776
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	717.1047299905375
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	1491.5264541283116
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	475.0168539818927
They went down Parliament street.	667.9261765843216
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	508.440818670092
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	374.89988397986343
Here goes.	330.7972949642207
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	2155.9209133532036
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	1363.4892286816723
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	1319.975253726872
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	1006.0593390463363
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	1824.8610339504307
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	1025.9103100312657
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	622.2450905043793
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	886.9895823415867
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	471.66881547206896
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	755.9630208046292
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	2158.923198367531
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	3132.7076174658214
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	1146.420697829477
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	1328.4810513804332
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	417.5363259621293
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	1233.8835606558744
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	977.7691694880806
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	1094.8476571388153
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	982.2082952455055
— What Dignam was that?	233.3737240450081
long John Fanning asked.	601.8604075699623
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	910.3226770564653
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	368.49994566788484
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	1167.2980091083398
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	1157.0725364667042
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	347.054030779156
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	869.3044491744394
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	799.4358660167377
— Rather lowsized.	774.4834435417112
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	325.59437838341097
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	834.485738702705
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	999.2700390792509
— What ’ s that?	126.48086317101261
Martin Cunningham said.	266.08842608504045
All turned where they stood.	465.75179887451895
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	847.2667492249085
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	1272.7665033350586
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	1054.3231292531132
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	1132.5525495428055
— What was it?	144.31709503085395
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	372.61339106667754
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	1041.2936471370354
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	1511.3543982668932
There in the corner.	129.74315321543304
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	1404.4744857593753
— Is that he?	177.70985087854197
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	511.308784689018
— Yes, Mulligan said.	141.5863374279909
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	498.9541182221877
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	1803.0492604047113
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	878.9734545084992
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	330.00171948735
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	446.34232471480937
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	905.2905065288787
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	582.2734959701615
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	856.397558902334
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	168.04968609227726
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	864.7651761750674
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	870.6798628585782
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	1003.2361030253797
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	452.09651866777995
Wandering Ængus I call him.	832.8843807317089
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	1004.1365495775973
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	653.6141309353134
Such persons always have.	904.7790850228246
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	858.9333022380902
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	548.7360669568423
He will never capture the Attic note.	1075.7885043064891
That is his tragedy.	289.80896981394926
He can never be a poet.	300.5903799205182
The joy of creation...	174.94165118311838
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	967.7306123331364
I see.	74.968645537024
I tackled him this morning on belief.	717.998577236913
There was something on his mind, I saw.	236.92255208707232
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	1080.9067019148974
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	719.680956818351
He helped her to unload her tray.	722.2988483205817
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	970.5368527320609
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	835.199682621763
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	1102.7960005892305
Does he write anything for your movement?	1033.9238352021998
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	2253.6845634945635
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	2267.4790019985708
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	733.0064973106377
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	291.877972567754
He is going to write something in ten years.	416.7136302663001
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	631.1782106210554
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	413.00615651837046
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	807.4328200064679
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	525.195258227427
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	331.36409138348216
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	2211.1141092692055
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	2046.4592065314966
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	1853.0945742042572
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	1063.7079120267147
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	2371.626956356851
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	823.096009723505
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	990.9995438895687
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	1801.6468398729314
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	2253.0815106372766
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	1285.2207396943513
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	1034.815980540843
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	1434.2587831705468
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	1282.086351863518
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	1482.1384118311062
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	3181.9611320440663
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	472.6766889844948
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	523.7507389589185
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	1467.8698226191134
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	658.7748623330505
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	445.1278100208144
That ’ s me in mourning.	189.00025585136154
When is it?	232.21888106466372
May the twentysecond.	427.1979749375314
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	342.65580933393676
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	496.39991413151535
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	904.1429268080776
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	875.7166339401789
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	744.5230300246038
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	1205.1482204497493
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	587.9611744663655
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	1314.5307549138422
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	698.9124130786661
No Sandymount tram.	696.7975729961458
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	965.0958976608285
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	655.2294155540369
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	644.3365442468743
He met schoolboys with satchels.	899.3530941769639
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	805.5235196843961
He met other schoolboys.	561.984967199992
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	542.6775514508797
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	673.5491749585314
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	393.949453974143
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	515.9499434118062
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	841.5743079117822
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	879.4639335979908
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	368.9957185684156
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	745.5902601872787
Never see him again.	305.0351763533037
Death, that is.	154.94997514501668
Pa is dead.	462.52821208178875
My father is dead.	343.87218118204254
He told me to be a good son to ma.	326.1866732613764
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	437.31028473087366
Poor pa.	478.2323158175867
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	245.51358512300388
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	664.1021064974311

In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	1030.1314515982954

A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	2333.498281305941
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	1078.9391902753812
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	2085.450849577675

A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	2008.6825342416876

Where gold from afar?	825.8044701338285
Where hoofs?	683.4594557949657

Be pfrwritt.	941.156257994358
Done.	238.63253457126893
Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	859.1481391316271
— Is that her?	195.41245604351903
asked miss Kennedy.	518.0322593751825
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	1228.4843900871483
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	840.5927021148416
— Who?	177.54062056318844
Where?	201.5556843520298
gold asked more eagerly.	701.0040463127574
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	416.7985468241377
He ’ s looking.	120.65588381849707
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	843.504930226181
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	794.3455460194917
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	1572.5376577942257
With sadness.	585.7125761313118
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	1823.0109489061206
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	1029.1623256090604
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	1996.6049981675226
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	348.49253544648167
A man.	106.58582376803506
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	1333.4390628394688
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	305.71079622613877
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	228.15112259313085
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	1664.7003369982367
— What is it?	155.58654219722976
loud boots unmannerly asked.	1442.5628557124799
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	1043.1696429339572
— Your _beau, _ is it?	355.17737671684995
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	1252.584534559046
Bloom.	52.298406001606715
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	1485.5245524815452
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	707.4152324605328
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	1445.5427788506458
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	986.154166593077
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	551.3812290434685
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	1363.4773279364883
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	691.8786530433567
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	1319.6360078339687
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	1229.9584569944911
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	1177.647818260195
It gets brown after.	566.8063897286193
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	1290.0138706376224
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	216.60847853366053
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	686.1983890341584
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	1575.7950866811816
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	515.6395275472929
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	808.0945185815364
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	2284.741542278876
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	180.70533747256786
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	291.5107039312781
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	1349.5190153943631
says he.	71.20917139150664
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	598.4573167407193
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	1526.899762966185
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	1117.7113179907242
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	930.9391164558739
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	2027.2664558188878
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	2201.8700433647778
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	589.3403950339641
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	1180.4854997070004
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	1525.300581498992
Why do I always think Figather?	1007.2563003734589
Gathering figs, I think.	627.6539623852116
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	1255.3642555882382
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	734.1743327059394
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	299.27565065069376
God they believe she is: or goddess.	462.86756287384
Those today.	366.4708369975028
I could not see.	160.97888170962887
That fellow spoke.	379.3903103571135
A student.	223.22352588368642
After with Dedalus ’ son.	289.28176539102304
He might be Mulligan.	237.5259976805465
All comely virgins.	955.0937681680425
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	651.103113122739
By went his eyes.	260.09692101298305
The sweets of sin.	363.5318290249781
Sweet are the sweets.	425.0023238131429
Of sin.	397.1184706952606
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	1854.0085608651355
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	1147.5310007472604
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	723.9340458283299
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	1156.7638852703676
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	1052.4920041242563
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	968.922408644476
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	675.0917383543957
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	1058.063605794219
And then laughed more.	341.7653582810636
Greasy I knows.	457.83903275723
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	1330.047733560709
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	458.5356879452732
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	317.3904968329209
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	1135.5271956744662
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	555.9780751736657
I feel all wet.	285.87095497056447
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	775.1402878637223
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	966.7962248172112
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	1359.6045024217888
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	834.8580235576802
Religion pays.	1132.9651678195964
Must see him for that par.	371.81394465698867
Eat first.	357.16410025275275
I want.	97.54479046615533
Not yet.	265.040628810107
At four, she said.	210.978102690718
Time ever passing.	569.9116480046623
Clockhands turning.	816.8947914426592
On. Where eat?	417.71717382484866
The Clarence, Dolphin.	430.27517327044177
On. For Raoul.	369.57022577076293
Eat.	219.45635629992586
If I net five guineas with those ads.	1133.5874212043739
The violet silk petticoats.	885.2395745962236
Not yet.	265.040628810107
The sweets of sin.	363.5318290249781
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	1641.4082443877924
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	1198.1509680623712
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	1302.2567077973579
He strolled.	242.45575455777293
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	328.895023350336
He held her hand.	222.0943957913145
Enjoyed her holidays?	1632.3464265943385
— Tiptop.	231.97356209944272
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	1112.0592142127134
— Gorgeous, she said.	202.56218509519084
Lying out on the strand all day.	431.34349480992574
Bronze whiteness.	930.2740099866628
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	615.1636472411069
Tempting poor simple males.	1835.0393689692019
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	1285.4569464754002
— O go away! she said.	242.59936917895655
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	355.46166419508336
He was.	60.853051520686726
— Well now I am, he mused.	298.6670366760076
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	880.9308540695748
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	760.5921057867138
And what did the doctor order today?	676.4975796579948
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	423.6511974694737
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	525.9933577660576
Jingle.	194.13978749570623
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	868.8016998130438
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	1206.7089800552003
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	1595.7485739477431
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	902.3307945391458
Alacrity she served.	851.7035970922609
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	1753.6150869155265
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	679.6658924441476
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	426.924361477705
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	492.1230140308688
Yes.	79.54417819042295
Yes.	79.54417819042295
Yes.	79.54417819042295
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	498.3491923316313
Chips.	287.5691785887357
Shreds.	362.3144614049264
Musing.	362.3144614049264
Mute.	316.5108355747976
None nought said nothing.	874.1606943235488
Yes.	79.54417819042295
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	1208.218572796819
In came Lenehan.	301.4439108231294
Round him peered Lenehan.	736.3587330212008
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	947.3830571250184
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	539.3358047416998
To Martha I must write.	567.9730191199502
Buy paper.	530.8380348330109
Daly ’ s.	177.2916986690461
Girl there civil.	724.6752865392317
Bloom.	52.298406001606715
Old Bloom.	180.19559954436215
Blue bloom is on the rye.	663.9689139731086
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	345.75131920170395
Lenehan came forward.	387.6004862216958
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	520.3182591827978
He asked.	111.32350377848694
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	538.2655377302594
She asked.	152.33026632657493
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	553.2693119265513
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	868.3813003065667
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	289.57847811476984
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	1268.1586962893475
To mind her stops.	508.3349267653204
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	1016.2875678993496
Jingle jaunty jingle.	1905.0168058742975
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	671.4171099716604
Take no notice.	554.9824114608903
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	2204.5452392647057
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	4414.9950629557525
He droned in vain.	530.4092893532021
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	666.3382054525841
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	625.3091093315975
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	522.1110183440536
— Who may he be?	315.2651700360548
Mr Dedalus asked.	223.16591218670712
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	1449.3724778221215
Who?	186.88939383826636
— Who may he be?	315.2651700360548
he asked.	89.54079260770219
Can you ask?	520.4121995105627
Dry.	362.3144614049264
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	719.6406391772164
— I see, he said.	88.88517375912052
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	315.00612076298836
I hear he is keeping very select company.	853.6099580019677
Have you seen him lately?	784.7354593889913
He had.	77.66075261408457
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	437.8809942491554
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	839.836790078922
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	1243.3345778600508
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	965.5833096759674
I see.	74.968645537024
He see.	93.35329408292418
He drank.	177.26193477945128
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	1848.1074324907045
Set down his glass.	552.4651553957154
— I see you have moved the piano.	268.75175028063455
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	970.8153308236494
— Is that a fact?	268.06438626257454
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	393.55988361267305
The real classical, you know.	342.3558839624809
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	353.84605736429444
— Is that a fact?	268.06438626257454
Mr Dedalus said.	153.90091348932694
He drank and strayed away.	513.5868840633192
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	665.2927719911027
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	468.73334112269714
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	717.2592637217963
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	775.7491115009701
Lager for diner.	848.5425371350625
Lager without alacrity she served.	1826.8592844754687
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	1605.4425442984111
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	782.903479316486
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	968.8498638108
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	1734.0829173916725
Are you not happy in your home?	547.5148626434041
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	1107.6875562011053
Means something, language of flow.	598.896221325246
Was it a daisy?	592.3844209431404
Innocence that is.	247.86020262219748
Respectable girl meet after mass.	1481.955329759443
Thanks awfully muchly.	1638.0457195522033
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	1522.4783563172089
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	1310.8090670622987
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	1730.3043954776892
For some man.	247.52477670344786
For Raoul.	440.90491045577295
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	1365.617637030708
It is.	97.75888083093557
Again.	219.45635629992586
Coincidence.	251.21481667538362
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	1590.8427313126622
Follow.	316.5108355747976
Risk it.	296.9853790920443
Go quick.	419.3095518746555
At four.	283.0342188602783
Near now.	283.96505938694094
Out.	154.08885144978342
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	453.59557482777655
— Aha...	84.35143664575679
I was forgetting...	92.97978758206011
Excuse...	74.95896595589792
— And four.	163.52390698891855
At four she.	308.46819168248305
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	1269.3915944492044
Bloo smi qui go.	2491.121219692119
Ternoon.	362.3144614049264
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	669.9439431444886
For men.	216.34539765865145
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	1221.2728670137674
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	421.07891869561075
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	515.287069710419
A call again.	241.36592387692986
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	590.5334106206849
You hear?	307.20213218073377
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	1304.6909601533812
Longer in dying call.	724.1133035888988
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	1228.7425823121287
— _The bright stars fade_...	482.5576747867037
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	443.8174084255402
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	4263.752397844889
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	525.2423516135136
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	476.14221915109505
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	924.8184690353354
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	286.7995503441226
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	831.8762755523311
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	898.9748691946673
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	619.4017336907425
he asked her.	106.68896071324977
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	748.127314161962
Like lady, ladylike.	497.17376985060446
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	1462.773393354259
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	686.3570891528301
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	827.064637758628
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	767.8708284988545
See me he might.	244.49760356871417
The seat he sat on: warm.	414.99666464282967
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	2447.1466012781016
— _And I from thee_...	237.20609497748092
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	321.7350434153179
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	1009.2447863325096
She smiled on him.	214.79185656785342
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	779.0660693746074
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	3557.7875519489066
— What ’ s your cry?	265.46710190022725
Glass of bitter?	725.7975437088701
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	388.85565013200875
Not yet.	265.040628810107
At four she.	308.46819168248305
Who said four?	386.21390295699473
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	583.2053579172905
Avoid.	362.3144614049264
Goulding a chance.	314.97858762456264
What is he doing in the Ormond?	302.77233476031944
Car waiting.	671.5762100749604
Wait.	118.6143906508203
Hello.	143.78458929436798
Where off to?	228.24596481563995
Something to eat?	489.8297392727727
I too was just.	145.13578681291608
In here.	158.9502238596487
What, Ormond?	248.88967021074706
Best value in Dublin.	496.73548716702777
Is that so?	260.21301608349677
Diningroom.	362.3144614049264
Sit tight there.	611.1688258612309
See, not be seen.	233.44671520311664
I think I ’ ll join you.	290.10396070560375
Come on.	117.37628846619381
Richie led on.	367.07267101369786
Bloom followed bag.	431.3176134599179
Dinner fit for a prince.	710.0440019471804
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	863.5677560396331
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	828.9256461978778
— Why don ’ t you grow?	452.70999020864684
asked Blazes Boylan.	485.9632391569604
That is to say she.	171.0981691135629
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	3823.7775642700217
He pitched a broad coin down.	815.1846408764582
Coin rang.	999.6444794885819
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	137.8090853168373
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	831.3964110622998
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	394.73358426270784
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	501.1373227297817
Not on my own, you know.	216.93903673811545
Fancy of a friend of mine.	326.6133419856329
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	1004.3405422921364
Idolores.	266.9555776457352
The eastern seas.	702.8854144118902
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	954.2118559230604
Clock clacked.	1132.9651678195964
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	1026.3035502532582
It clanged.	444.64883958899435
Clock clacked.	1132.9651678195964
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	1016.2278153810337
Look to the west.	208.07296804112067
A clack.	363.0901552219435
For me.	136.18215855066285
— What time is that?	199.93532949383754
asked Blazes Boylan.	485.9632391569604
Four?	415.6382910348719
O ’ clock.	176.06370411874437
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	1467.41192484401
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	152.53028552639478
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	1430.33208138195
Be near.	356.6369193322629
At four.	283.0342188602783
Has he forgotten?	610.9776150698096
Perhaps a trick.	385.6093626048389
Not come: whet appetite.	1210.2213162228513
I couldn ’ t do.	200.4835477916692
Wait, wait.	187.07163135416948
Pat, waiter, waited.	335.4628224794718
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	2483.2031782318113
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	361.71045657454124
There ’ s no - one.	216.14578354802939
He never heard.	207.94207731913843
—...	25.80284968496271
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	1234.8618636466567
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	1216.6708714192032
— Please, please.	257.1460148086639
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	1730.1331744432255
— _I could not leave thee_...	421.5022625830974
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	1438.463667907283
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	249.20976906698994
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	690.8043618897518
She looked.	174.30385924639444
Quick.	205.25706077185902
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	852.0418584482932
Sudden bent.	806.2141314147009
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	2034.3063780647472
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	622.3857505849697
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	942.7736083552502
Delayed.	362.3144614049264
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	825.3856757487171
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	447.9810015953096
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	2915.9143173885072
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	1248.3248700078564
Trained by owner.	841.9873758965994
No sawdust there.	420.57765260233845
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	1186.6144772553619
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	413.49938902237744
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	325.1752333193185
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	1937.8274672595578
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	1594.1136236816167
Yes, bronze from anearby.	488.829239239764
—...	25.80284968496271
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	436.1683984320168
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	1104.1710594316723
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	622.4706233155831
I wanted to tell you.	187.7215822972029
Tom Rochford...	155.41394282664368
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	353.49158362665855
Lenehan gulped to go.	527.7821355527728
— Got the horn or what?	449.95142405116826
he said.	56.271385512740096
Wait.	118.6143906508203
I ’ m coming.	164.31286366796715
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	331.5530149645236
— Eh?	283.4823815992919
How do?	285.7461703300801
How do?	285.7461703300801
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	1133.1289438712904
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	452.215992644502
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	582.8579126342744
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	720.0386667977837
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	1217.0366781314976
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	1107.9200811445487
Come on, Simon.	175.46661812680247
Give us a ditty.	528.0258052276939
We heard the piano.	296.3388505211968
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	1309.095638178083
Power for Richie.	307.3752209260575
And Bloom?	172.9893785946066
Let me see.	222.1131400297458
Not make him walk twice.	596.0870518291696
His corns.	384.991589599228
Four now.	289.27511586643743
How warm this black is.	450.5524645997438
Course nerves a bit.	603.7896514535568
Refracts (is it?) heat.	393.66362790669723
Let me see.	222.1131400297458
Cider.	316.5108355747976
Yes, bottle of cider.	321.8581344096563
— What ’ s that?	126.48086317101261
Mr Dedalus said.	153.90091348932694
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	307.52706791277257
Begone dull care.	1303.2890224201317
Come, Bob.	188.6584338229559
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	679.4953265686061
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	577.378104449077
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	1132.6309415565577
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	1625.2849369919993
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	605.1399389321298
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	488.706613272517
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	1146.5701222736552
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	404.7644503670538
He ’ s off.	97.99062368358098
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	1555.8256848467151
Jingling.	266.9555776457352
He ’ s gone.	126.37005091115935
Jingle.	194.13978749570623
Hear.	238.63253457126893
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	312.6262258997938
God be with old times.	271.73595292848717
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	772.5933941830083
Gone.	189.40276820613508
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	939.7543036019243
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	1662.0593171437715
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	877.0067703746345
There was.	99.76551273829607
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	329.6716121418046
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	480.3222126610532
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	574.9037797287729
— God, do you remember?	255.44772446689794
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	1115.664834022942
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	1005.7081128244685
They laughed all three.	381.1959982215335
He had no wed.	324.8169706752394
All trio laughed.	964.459224417905
No wedding garment.	991.6093655496186
— Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	475.8705307178786
Where ’ s my pipe, by the way?	251.6366367042085
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	581.7773678570134
Bald Pat carried two diners ’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	1419.295035624631
And Father Cowley laughed again.	650.6943346922584
— I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	268.0507823804206
— You did, averred Ben Dollard.	547.0686937689708
I remember those tight trousers too.	625.5882019069736
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	396.70464661234763
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	2287.2299476080507
He saved the situa.	447.3218386550074
Tight trou.	1238.6312932739854
Brilliant ide.	1694.178082865129
— I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	149.05453716373734
The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?	897.0609350778815
Do you remember?	427.74978581816515
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh ’ s gave us the number.	611.5746075398546
Remember?	372.91154839422165
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	1171.7971777388368
— By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	682.0789997805292
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	482.42338236023977
— Merrion square style.	860.3638609846244
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.	476.1388058402037
He wouldn ’ t take any money either.	598.6377649384117
What?	128.2987952047132
Any God ’ s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose.	1164.5972251539383
— Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.	398.6600892285484
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.	879.0661411649427
Jingle jaunted down the quays.	897.2998256521319
Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.	2196.4138312549735
Liver and bacon.	612.0353257872079
Steak and kidney pie.	1002.3553424493488
Right, sir.	171.52967434176472
Right, Pat.	226.5652461686252
Mrs Marion.	295.07108041574463
Met him pike hoses.	1331.236365735021
Smell of burn.	531.0162166691946
Of Paul de Kock.	1581.2215786380436
Nice name he.	244.366420523601
— What ’ s this her name was?	215.29720787200472

So. That will do.	217.1412718744501

Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet.	1101.3811026372155
Love ’ s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	1305.168744383814
Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	1209.1221643068325

Richie, admiring, descanted on that man ’ s glorious voice.	576.7779610284788

_He drink me my teas.	977.2497883152913
He eat me my sugars.	594.491624534113
Because he no pay me my moneys? _ For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of <NUM> Saint Kevin ’ s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	1211.187308065412
Geraghty, esquire, of <NUM> Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	1470.25931063703
— Are you a strict <URL>.?	328.44256443760975
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	525.8735468334341
— What about paying our respects to our friend?	941.364722164238
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Who?	177.54062056318844
says I.	71.09709925223822
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	223.15225740505434
— Drinking his own stuff?	759.6681032584946
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Ay, says I.	133.2907487313896
Whisky and water on the brain.	426.6425415244802
— Come around to Barney Kiernan ’ s, says Joe.	443.644742535263
I want to see the citizen.	169.58660476626395
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	286.3091566987847
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	1143.1789122283944
— Not a word, says Joe.	219.7036209001418
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	329.3960878970723
— What was that, Joe?	161.31824779795298
says I.	71.09709925223822
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	535.7643898625095
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	295.19130569143266
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	645.6324930899352
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	536.9253632579047
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	783.0889895966461
For trading without a licence, says he.	506.3711346926527
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	672.1660287400848
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	1305.0521540573686
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	1020.7356848072827
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	1132.0674322962927
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	1607.3892644957225
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	2203.3691974161893
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	1040.5512676589342
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	2371.945779850163
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	2512.2284591145535
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	214.76236022007703
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	2034.8648135511978
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	588.7163887720648
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	394.9413680023453
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	661.2780895159789
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	773.1439780332644
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	642.6741418227026
— Stand and deliver, says he.	279.95665960526554
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	204.72133146612185
Friends here.	474.8760922275659
— Pass, friends, says he.	226.91935076332047
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	339.64571187218337
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	603.3488389832648
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	332.58484903014727
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	399.83182573815924
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	709.5673291571745
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	560.3385770727857
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	458.3238069356506
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	513.1897833151411
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	229.37235443342178
— Wine of the country, says he.	180.3874617736163
— What ’ s yours?	256.15933083007064
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	474.9535736945613
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	427.37712723276184
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	257.35714119216294
says he.	71.20917139150664
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	522.4705828828937
What Garry?	618.4815361289616
Are we going to win?	687.1689064939433
Eh?	348.78337379607075
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	413.13832696122927
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	6177.411710669088
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	2030.2940504748692
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	1963.130233946774
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	699.9329252641553
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	2206.6334471443415
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	1648.8961391204798
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	2260.315754806679
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	2684.5000747941135
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	2797.126384867473
Fursa, S.	309.86499471306536
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn ’ t, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	1180.477640502207
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.	1837.4102131705208
Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O ’ Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O ’ Sullivan Beare.	2742.368080492477
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	3234.6892960481355
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	1079.285942446381
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	263.28162194668755
A goodlooking sovereign.	713.0376461928073
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	210.60733952558334
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	714.4148064920249
says I.	71.09709925223822
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	397.5992487636123
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	800.161977776769
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	598.6946142752209
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	1480.0923807202078
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	182.96996260592448
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	574.5271109008611
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	350.28026363145614
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	390.1088387249723
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	504.9764404178515
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	660.8709391167649
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	511.12578000323674
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	1199.0207326712389
How ’ s that, eh?	201.64120238612685
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	2038.4585777755435
Eh?	348.78337379607075
Deaths.	362.3144614049264
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	966.7801762344677
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	363.9647932742051
— Cockburn.	263.5728537658378
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	1287.0325807546942
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	601.445175324947
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	396.59096330881886
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	335.65641128692596
Drink that, citizen.	222.44899324759703
— I will, says he, honourable person.	209.6933959353582
— Health, Joe, says I.	202.3029824689998
And all down the form.	182.174532425395
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	584.9173641936169
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	768.5372273011048
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	1015.4032091676947
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	993.1027070906167
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	752.1657599844849
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	483.0831129788437
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	1518.055203636114
I thought Alf would split.	562.3166271790346
— Look at him, says he.	155.81234821268265
Breen.	158.25541778739878
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	698.5190439216683
p: up on it to take a li...	225.30950744599568
And he doubled up.	278.9732232663554
— Take a what?	251.0758096285689
says I.	71.09709925223822
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	586.7774086755769
— O hell! says I.	214.6477124470032
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	607.8278634050632
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	898.2931794258075
— Who?	177.54062056318844
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Breen, says Alf.	250.92851644453444
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	501.2856547026782
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	349.72914665161414
U.	171.07155394842053
p: up.	197.41905946744282
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	702.3657498240597
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	720.3935810013827
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	577.4694397694524
Is that Alf Bergan?	842.7221330608099
— Yes, says Alf.	186.85908776325422
Hanging?	537.831520434236
Wait till I show you.	355.9105922440557
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	1197.7302881919313
You should have seen long John ’ s eye.	489.7613578355808
U.	171.07155394842053
p....	52.74509418286161
— Who are you laughing at?	367.3681001703894
says Bob Doran.	513.0018668626071
Is that Bergan?	567.6418494194282
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	447.7317717391139
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	2485.463499293418
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	1451.2471461616926
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	738.6834580652511
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	1192.178191486975
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	820.2508760485314
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	516.2778375444485
— What ’ s that?	126.48086317101261
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	471.9746921555414
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	546.5040183892561
Hangmen ’ s letters.	412.40930955162787
Look at here.	258.6784480265291
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	544.6012377986212
— Are you codding?	635.695526961803
says I.	71.09709925223822
— Honest injun, says Alf.	700.3312589719618
Read them.	266.7342653197023
So Joe took up the letters.	404.4557665015968
— Who are you laughing at?	367.3681001703894
says Bob Doran.	513.0018668626071
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	307.5125024116335
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	573.962591877938
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	224.04874076504734
Only I was running after that...	169.52348388715836
— You what?	200.27853573555626
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	350.34206622659076
With who?	282.8238291933197
— With Dignam, says Alf.	290.177580724981
— Is it Paddy?	375.32241020514886
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Yes, says Alf.	186.85908776325422
Why?	203.35538390318914
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	264.0580782453886
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	572.960226932436
— Ay, says Joe.	206.23539842421778
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	730.2952136927853
— Who ’ s dead?	232.03825341033357
says Bob Doran.	513.0018668626071
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	441.31609497001693
— What?	133.89864297395368
says Alf.	189.32249297027738
Good Christ, only five...	204.70231668019426
What?...	46.06989192954255
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	291.8237682987998
What?	128.2987952047132
Dignam dead?	451.6682393128636
— What about Dignam?	318.43459097503313
says Bob Doran.	513.0018668626071
Who ’ s talking about...?	130.4301940505659
— Dead! says Alf.	374.54574705745716
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	285.74941423702137
— Maybe so, says Joe.	304.6433384602462
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	760.9987910304321
— Paddy?	250.64331029553037
says Alf.	189.32249297027738
— Ay, says Joe.	206.23539842421778
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	447.8197213703087
— Good Christ! says Alf.	465.217157859191
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	770.1002346980179
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	1662.8316749330204
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	2014.2755742917439
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	1243.4931077551284
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	1115.2460661029559
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	1633.986770250196
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	2120.4736183590944
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	1460.3760292534532
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	723.2091050967755
Mind C.	439.89941950931154
K.	181.1572307024632
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	1066.7692261009392
J.	78.32022695006061
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	788.6004346067432
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	841.6847282035072
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	1161.3691661727753
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	823.2709296785181
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	591.2579535072017
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	746.2186796321146
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	657.6087409953132
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	229.68037045331548
— Who?	177.54062056318844
— Bloom, says he.	89.28867358124849
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	412.5745560942638
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	587.6011486502729
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	1591.9996049705537
Faith, he was.	156.52846802574453
— Good Christ! says he.	285.3136715943252
I could have sworn it was him.	295.56730103079883
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	512.7044882933588
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	522.9516262120464
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	765.954883894821
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	306.00326131832685
He ’ s over all his troubles.	214.13091051378123
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	613.3694927194556
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	426.2356359883931
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	795.6266525818626
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	952.2088854673128
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	534.0125912883535
Talking through his bloody hat.	573.1701482572088
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	929.4745793055613
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	230.31289824751778
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	490.7328819035057
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	659.665066954231
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	1163.858386675273
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	218.03594774092548
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	647.6714291580228
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	372.10057305729487
Listen to this, will you?	270.6388977293286
And he starts reading out one.	415.3625944766307
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	1477.3880539213728
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... _ — Jesus, says I.	1161.380035942863
— _...	34.42667701617272
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	935.8093179206755
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	1218.509266566733
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	637.1880512300818
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	373.51739153384557
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	293.55443684747684
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	434.88211772983817
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	635.0648698577874
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	769.9107377492098
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	825.7942451054803
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	923.4231580118852
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	690.3669688602243
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	2273.7782373698315
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	749.6551856015803
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	485.9455720174226
— What ’ s that?	126.48086317101261
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	533.9701714541584
— That so?	202.30768644307292
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	250.99777074689715
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	699.3645605632408
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	566.3645809143777
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	628.3179016225521
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	467.53015413562076
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	219.70987500375452
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	690.5918837882708
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	1667.5698109070952
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	658.795180797618
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	2131.2070736932615
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	707.3600944793708
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	879.4808307821736
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	555.5848513806402
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	857.5101127137563
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	1141.2807746864232
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	680.3346351676238
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	745.1966998523728
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	914.9262424516459
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	780.2753520292075
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	467.63361906920113
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	671.0295759312787
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	525.5511487570686
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	276.2990599653444
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	425.5378760659174
What I mean is...	99.7288332357992
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	467.8360295204761
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	1296.8732160345887
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	630.4412525276567
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	2193.286669046932
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	2309.4218142813193
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	3255.5089218360113
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	4064.973313120871
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	2542.91495151715
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	1655.8297019052081
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	2960.2590414851043
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	3041.337152938222
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	18066.100557875023
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	2509.616888975293
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	1174.0979117743402
O.	56.514357636516635
T.	156.1165688701983
E.	145.31432739865093
I.	32.136872171882345
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	678.9369258625757
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	1514.8668158059047
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	2656.3995389444544
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	1249.1486300619686
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	1399.3008454239714
O.	56.514357636516635
T.	156.1165688701983
E.	145.31432739865093
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	457.8146505921569
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	2003.8785683436465
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	2255.587077447469
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	1724.5625262662134
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	1628.3811501761907
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	2209.6824416385894
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	954.2174304313136
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	1260.481414068559
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	1517.670887622602
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	1950.5497301540238
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	2048.098501828528
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	3017.99311818411
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	1614.8395226063649
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	1641.7887669956551
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	1789.7392054545187
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	2804.72791838988
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	2049.128466978143
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	939.9481757978623
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	1095.2011400021572
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	880.6599380279292
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	1851.0115409035025
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	1067.3503569892566
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	1176.4802358202637
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	2053.4909426158424
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	1525.3459656701682
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	854.4292336299501
Antitreating is about the size of it.	327.37897112965646
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	685.064134488913
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	1186.6864669468143
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	847.6035287870112
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	961.1471246870822
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	1103.7717609024048
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	792.5574151364716
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	347.6124024922912
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	742.1661919706943
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	505.6281411529007
says the citizen, jeering.	247.6229884097745
— No, says I.	103.00654591014795
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	605.9211057243851
So he calls the old dog over.	370.17208421452244
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	214.79735828824752
says he.	71.20917139150664
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	666.250867921852
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	899.8236311716493
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	903.9617792839042
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	710.1670047478259
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	1943.6763884659224
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	1129.0444188779766
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	2308.419307527559
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	1932.6421121087253
O.	56.514357636516635
C.	105.94139119590463
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	1426.8612588414055
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	2145.9409452717564
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	2151.551668455163
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	1853.9575212204068
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	2117.6453708237586
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	622.3357143147177
And Joe asked him would he have another.	368.42605841570656
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	454.7214185656912
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	285.93997639149944
Entertainment for man and beast.	531.0450191092993
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	680.0646777341158
— Could a swim duck?	905.0853250770909
says I.	71.09709925223822
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	338.715672240948
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	682.4894533261171
says he.	71.20917139150664
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	171.67253119209965
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	510.1164744468394
Martin asked me to go to the house.	229.9313200825711
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	548.4250155060997
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	536.8969860496112
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	566.7965506879922
— Whose admirers?	1104.0862174395131
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	257.7304840849403
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	641.274975465038
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	2578.72907651222
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	1373.149152734627
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	765.7429471119729
Choking with bloody foolery.	1212.4714167305376
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	443.0808656914974
Shake hands, brother.	442.73375158416957
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	324.4304086545317
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	842.187140039676
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	911.6247427279269
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	866.5537234358873
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	314.8867391979527
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	1182.3079956421784
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	374.91815061823127
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	937.0864828087406
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	1025.540597907495
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	1047.9343005928638
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	757.2014231928642
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	679.2465182721851
_How is your testament?	1382.9659421707283
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	617.0029518972502
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	534.5696612917187
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	528.4316776879131
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	809.7864075238874
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	546.8894192428415
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	522.0989326676981
So Terry brought the three pints.	826.7112496668583
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	321.253786026138
Here, citizen.	166.98904492672503
— _Slan leat_, says he.	451.83698545607314
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	202.3029824689998
Good health, citizen.	359.0807981514482
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	531.5221535942319
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	778.9438709750235
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	479.97075771548623
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	412.1895110142701
— Nannan?	434.1269480091095
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
The mimber?	617.9230872199612
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	487.0410359234041
— I thought so, says Joe.	199.3932475867813
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	492.60364482239123
P., the cattle traders.	264.2426230581082
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	581.8374076457103
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	1050.15818171656
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	394.72071393834756
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	841.6613380547979
Mister Knowall.	1694.178082865129
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	1862.8283393553272
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	851.7504655048659
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	1235.2232314860187
What ’ s your programme today?	500.8605861628618
Ay. Humane methods.	824.7601494069658
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	1230.5491832448286
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	431.0009391332458
Klook Klook Klook.	1627.4254026662409
Black Liz is our hen.	1512.1331511002547
She lays eggs for us.	704.5877660779176
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	904.2295275101054
Gara.	287.5691785887357
Klook Klook Klook.	1627.4254026662409
Then comes good uncle Leo.	1249.8074659557635
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	1110.376523234374
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	8283.382310892594
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	343.10180378930187
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	248.9305293853669
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	278.9493742695742
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	199.57159567984655
I wanted particularly.	349.2100876176848
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	810.934297619896
I couldn ’ t phone.	378.8224082745767
No. You ’ re sure?	304.9700834939105
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	313.4838099695539
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	1113.5282131163117
What do you think of that, citizen?	241.49260513246026
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	4672.276658755972
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	1821.5777333117076
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	1544.761901751345
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	912.2369624654403
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	881.4926260316884
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	858.3102539169115
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	460.2428541898651
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	1137.7902576041465
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	1691.483877966339
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	2111.0460076130007
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	434.7947317286459
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	976.0143621357442
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	615.2457233929395
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	1335.360542819363
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	418.91754150306343
There he is sitting there.	262.02554856894665
The man that got away James Stephens.	650.4840901882632
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	886.0631965189388
What was your best throw, citizen?	474.6749462848706
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	600.5088444527128
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	335.0313447278643
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	264.3254964033571
You were and a bloody sight better.	366.54180710597285
— Is that really a fact?	411.39046490059366
says Alf.	189.32249297027738
— Yes, says Bloom.	131.5507275629815
Did you not know that?	302.3405605584769
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	977.0113670716735
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	586.3721777651903
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	510.45779688395083
Do you see that straw?	469.26386496295396
That ’ s a straw_.	234.0282518482912
Declare to my aunt he ’ d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	747.4653492696477
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	1737.4042518533372
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	636.5544453563931
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	1745.9068006726982
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	1732.933360250367
L.	148.5809057155056
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	2184.622993832333
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	1687.2693194135072
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	2041.8112474146856
The proceedings then terminated.	912.7986910757984

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	1152.9641880414254
— No, says Joe.	159.37787309524683
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	565.6325626720507
— Who?	177.54062056318844
Blazes?	295.98009210603857
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	466.8675549941966
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	271.54070218376654
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	472.85920125329676
— We know him, says the citizen.	184.21044184211345
The traitor ’ s son.	312.36063651411695
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	575.5949101401297
— True for you, says Joe.	243.51172751512726
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	639.8456625888041
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	602.0550994124867
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	340.17086730605047
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	685.1362628000372
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	639.6842447732541
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	1144.4144865934718
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	1192.0804404641553
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	1356.746790690971
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	1938.2251974260246
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	1101.0869181242606
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	961.8880859472024
The men came to handigrips.	470.75439891625774
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	1210.0982160416154
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	1357.5002605495354
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	260.9252710319266
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	1761.416792095315
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	2100.6616638518244
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	1546.2628743877262
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	2486.2177443477535
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	543.7905266614393
— He is, says Joe.	139.53119091631999
Isn ’ t he?	268.40003556419964
— Who?	177.54062056318844
says Bloom.	102.43904407930623
Ah, yes.	148.00854975881995
That ’ s quite true.	276.8102479585125
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	268.50032786209226
Just a holiday.	373.9023649651031
— Mrs B.	236.62008489099122
is the bright particular star, isn ’ t she?	530.1447622574652
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— My wife?	323.4674080040461
says Bloom.	102.43904407930623
She ’ s singing, yes.	188.57650038428505
I think it will be a success too.	322.35884160148225
He ’ s an excellent man to organise.	416.08014570437024

— Hello, Ned.	194.12405914859465
— Hello, Alf.	198.42015323695043
— Hello, Jack.	208.7805520398906
— Hello, Joe.	171.8604568368332
— God save you, says the citizen.	222.52341542338453
— Save you kindly, says J.	413.72370172749714
J.	78.32022695006061
What ’ ll it be, Ned?	236.02397250280669
— Half one, says Ned.	284.495961311629
So J.	203.0024318006661
J.	78.32022695006061
ordered the drinks.	504.4693330503518
— Were you round at the court?	378.5713314337985
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Yes, says J.	156.40781975639482
He ’ ll square that, Ned, says he.	198.0108996884118
— Hope so, says Ned.	300.2424804255326
Now what were those two at?	488.9802067236922
J.	78.32022695006061

getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile.	661.5108882168302
With his name in Stubbs ’ s.	287.7923332519231
Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.	2251.478908961469
Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no - one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop.	898.734921674203
What ’ s your name, sir?	221.14126007643392
Dunne, says he.	191.5651692416854
Ay, and done says I.	184.28287252978444
Gob, he ’ ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I ’ m thinking.	515.2928293610322
— Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?	868.1214240823855
says Alf.	189.32249297027738
U.	171.07155394842053

Looking for a private detective.	739.2925038172774
— Ay, says Ned.	228.93330770537284
And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	1062.2188211511295
— Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	545.8607135980345
God, I ’ d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	461.77788534368494
— Was it you did it, Alf?	281.3138186878136
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	661.9549902939636
— Me?	286.79852883038546
says Alf.	189.32249297027738
Don ’ t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	862.4131459806207
— Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	645.1155938766847
— Of course an action would lie, says J.	610.7568344282048
J.	78.32022695006061
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	1144.0795040392484
U.	171.07155394842053
p: up.	197.41905946744282
_ — Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	527.0880475595213
Do you know that he ’ s balmy?	360.8766650529662
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	508.41871688210483
— Yes, says J.	156.40781975639482
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	428.5636593467951
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	448.52947413158137
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	239.93385053608515
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	226.35261531425678
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	719.5342517285525
— How half and half?	348.4584927708794
says Bloom.	102.43904407930623
Do you mean he...	119.44548622465481
— Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	273.3199973459698
A fellow that ’ s neither fish nor flesh.	661.3469941627176
— Nor good red herring, says Joe.	774.1113486431655
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	305.4475158285682
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	659.5637257897574
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	806.6428647383539
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	941.6271368812702
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’ s was pewopener to the pope.	604.3321931084712
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’ s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	1007.0168058204811
And who was he, tell us?	242.82761276875968
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	796.7917822587062
— And moreover, says J.	329.2352330847465
J., a postcard is publication.	277.7902480305831
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	1424.8931229876246
Hole.	362.3144614049264
In my opinion an action might lie.	1064.6703046509153
Six and eightpence, please.	460.65139544577255
Who wants your opinion?	1027.7680543020008
Let us drink our pints in peace.	1022.93276660518
Gob, we won ’ t be let even do that much itself.	574.5175395452308
— Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	331.06435886232606
— Good health, Ned, says J.	325.14018195156603
J.	78.32022695006061
— - There he is again, says Joe.	256.2782599769161
— Where?	187.89080628242704
says Alf.	189.32249297027738
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	654.8554753698467
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	1155.6736449036587
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Remanded, says J.	299.5456425170605
J.	78.32022695006061
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	1490.510256287642
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	404.3895131552945
Course it was a bloody barney.	561.2336757416684
What?	128.2987952047132
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	811.475426310028
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	911.0893504074511
— Who tried the case?	404.003493856911
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Recorder, says Ned.	351.2128611844103
— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	447.48972780291837
— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	470.7500918873254
— Ay, says Alf.	233.26916803432147
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	1082.3376063086891
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	1286.7916103958742
Ten, did you say?	315.4408758643163
— Yes, your worship.	244.66160021002537
And my wife has the typhoid.	423.62989762987735
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	902.3167188695669
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	364.62489530593643
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	776.2375532561566
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	753.0733884615634
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	1500.0028404378245
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	779.6678066903401
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	494.7912451067261
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	476.0141426108116
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	1204.6929849265823
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	749.3500114669721
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	1637.7216453198223
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	1195.272867957373
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	661.9246205594471
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	715.3882854438418
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	407.9530481080014
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	381.18604862389714
That ’ s the whole secret.	227.59783927726522
— Rely on me, says Joe.	304.4364479038439
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	256.85871753319424
We want no more strangers in our house.	696.2941613199745
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	253.74365385824856
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	229.7625398439888
— Consider that done, says Joe.	394.0383514450214
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	209.72757780453628
— The strangers, says the citizen.	222.87894416180671
Our own fault.	602.2014220773823
We let them come in.	276.7907861450174
We brought them in.	220.05247837358738
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	1267.2985128314924
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	560.4529654191866
J.	78.32022695006061
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	599.9584888212222
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	320.27814551544185
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	543.2124888700054

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	820.5683382926231
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	593.0474631959011
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	309.15294693592665
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	1472.2367546449705
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	1111.059951002674
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	174.80008292578503
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	927.4541987708835
J.	78.32022695006061
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	1004.353984713824
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	345.9748892712273
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	935.1829249427468
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	1134.1493266810398
Tonguetied sons of bastards ’ ghosts.	1463.505187659675
— The European family, says J.	406.0726177486309
J....	35.99505761534088
— They ’ re not European, says the citizen.	318.82094461968524
I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	535.1468762487032
You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	1111.7757553691251
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	1651.8260948079364
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	149.65797741678674
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	510.804060724072
— Gold cup, says he.	245.18862740866064
— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	350.82165980833696
says Terry.	243.00550089273594
_ — Throwaway, _ says he, at twenty to one.	227.72026753340458
A rank outsider.	728.5529827688231
And the rest nowhere.	346.7105048074059

Such is life in an outhouse.	628.7899625057635
_Throwaway, _ says he.	203.36687793398985

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	3694.0608405037606
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	5539.750869825649
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	1669.5956632797681
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	1936.9247078006154
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	1314.4069598050783
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	2720.120190565186
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	1829.6060976482397
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	315.56006397632194
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	1145.4833761022373
— And will again, says Joe.	234.56930124349572
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	365.661260656198
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	1217.7953144481512
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	837.4289423453332
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	356.5011482011957

What will you have?	258.806627250917
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	758.0221930001153
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	302.0366660368112
Terry! Are you asleep?	861.0536297781453
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	211.381590559524
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	1179.4363047699323
Right, sir.	171.52967434176472
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public.	1281.8228462353052
Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate.	703.3510746357581
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him.	1181.901143893009
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	602.2248046182781
— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	862.0419973757727
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	206.78343710686164
Hell upon earth it is.	511.32586342342984
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	817.855189734641
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	1993.9084116185684
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	1150.9262236098555
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	807.8079231008699
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	751.2185699128781
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	1053.5090386452378
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	495.413044580129
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	668.3268212721831
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	1017.4113731771497
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	415.30146440301905
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	199.17362567222622
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	953.1648860323331
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	1219.548075305687
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	422.16023442532287
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	709.8313452791989
Didn ’ t I tell you?	346.5124123417278
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	826.7339031203668
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	503.8336996719326
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	804.9913704169245
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	362.7023685312481
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	1631.3007806920511
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	1786.400500906973
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	1540.9272915500844
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	597.1542031386202
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	614.6170407090109
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	345.34181597955507
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	847.7911168778977
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	347.07512894500553
But my point was...	121.94944030447162
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	346.6835016240543
— Ay, says John Wyse.	325.15270956165193
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	1417.5729306624098
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	1091.3049796576217
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	870.69375929129
Fontenoy, eh?	653.9595108529467
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	1359.04054682686
But what did we ever get for it?	456.15659390883565
— The French! says the citizen.	238.22327293220377
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	810.1228168679593
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	1007.4116771024344
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	1392.170962416368
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	804.6871338429056
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	838.2405067777929
— Well, says J.	172.81915755450163
J.	78.32022695006061
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	656.4260936710643
— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	208.74197966017854
Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	1074.138103206696
The earl of Dublin, no less.	346.130152328158
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	515.5206862005064
And says J.	188.17658551168034
J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	1016.4679981522486
— Will you try another, citizen?	500.8747438672839
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Yes, sir, says he.	122.50184800963386
I will.	79.35156763903721
— You?	145.9639671501904
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	192.7891287320809
May your shadow never grow less.	1329.3412200015537
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	528.3066203077136
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	216.11536440474467
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	4342.6111353155875
— But do you know what a nation means?	540.2593933664488
says John Wyse.	335.81593396233177
— Yes, says Bloom.	131.5507275629815
— What is it?	155.58654219722976
says John Wyse.	335.81593396233177
— A nation?	333.06814909010114
says Bloom.	102.43904407930623
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	455.6113764209779
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	343.26663035927476
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	560.590808405039
— What is your nation if I may ask?	630.6669400366115
says the citizen.	117.37307592871822
— Ireland, says Bloom.	147.21266062569504
Ireland.	103.41801164465235
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	671.6365484054941
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	447.9282882243584
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	237.90998962454998
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	583.135661549998
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	3508.096253500827
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	1370.665528921034
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	1891.8853996752982
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	1493.7154769216236
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	1088.9552376906622
— Show us over the drink, says I.	261.7070588901033
Which is which?	371.2210767640428
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	287.43517261463404
Also now.	253.62452348547046
This very moment.	409.55374790382365
This very instant.	487.4724708305058
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	542.5522542462313
— Robbed, says he.	204.66911956561955
Plundered.	362.3144614049264
Insulted.	362.3144614049264
Persecuted.	362.3144614049264
Taking what belongs to us by right.	670.8472273294688
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	948.7018516002959
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	620.6290145685624
says the citizen.	117.37307592871822
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	369.40517564083063
— Right, says John Wyse.	344.8278824874032
Stand up to it then with force like men.	470.21024895194915
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	419.91071283014327
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	1101.8252133723502
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	717.2956612065086
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	423.7951112200163
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	636.6958935627092
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	186.74407012413326
Force, hatred, history, all that.	349.45518312939754
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	421.6881248359842
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	364.98545577863973
— What?	133.89864297395368
says Alf.	189.32249297027738
— Love, says Bloom.	169.54331015944285
I mean the opposite of hatred.	334.61372527547564
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	293.9618070778878
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	371.4015744447952
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	366.43869209284196
Just a moment.	211.66669208824035
Who ’ s hindering you?	428.74525835526174
And off he pops like greased lightning.	1244.300133485753
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	377.87080714194195
Universal love.	536.0815158956937
— Well, says John Wyse.	292.2159347465241
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	381.5232212954386
Love your neighbour.	552.7774894379845
— That chap?	321.1578614735394
says the citizen.	117.37307592871822
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	931.4112671653035
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	659.8341770190916
Love loves to love love.	608.7059354868803
Nurse loves the new chemist.	1091.4523165697506
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	1512.7805601458272
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	690.8070726188297
M.	92.54832975572836
B.	131.3245447289437
loves a fair gentleman.	464.0429200989194
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	1655.8377450988771
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	554.90742300606
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	1101.1667659281331
Mrs Norman W.	849.7905923997797
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	2998.6052466644046
You love a certain person.	426.577957723174
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	2089.682395101867
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	316.5572446862823
More power, citizen.	410.6889099803065
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	233.3363172922738
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	612.6650542919532
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	649.7550234647765
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	1429.4157443084803
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	1569.000399852324
— What ’ s that?	126.48086317101261
says Joe.	152.61157918920318
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	1574.0358418867786
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	1374.623622159419
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	1865.9770155119706
— Widow woman, says Ned.	395.9485783203608
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	294.1218270709123
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	447.37755907044414
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	383.0168664137287
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	2824.1914065424435
— Is that by Griffith?	445.00612601484494
says John Wyse.	335.81593396233177
— No, says the citizen.	134.52750389009483
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	571.5115891700044
It ’ s only initialled: P.	413.58194751326124
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	366.6218484730631
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	225.608096399017
Trade follows the flag.	962.6518938508252
— Well, says J.	172.81915755450163
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	1011.5856662810603
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	415.98537714476925
— Casement, says the citizen.	245.12246697883072
He ’ s an Irishman.	208.37118717650657
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	125.31309316556927
J.	78.32022695006061
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	707.0818668042039
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	316.1291595274839
— Who?	177.54062056318844
says I.	71.09709925223822
— Bloom, says he.	89.28867358124849
The courthouse is a blind.	370.48549525717567
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	486.29030411653065
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	1030.3984292590872
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	468.13523485602155
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	210.38612212367642
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	562.4579279756881
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	186.001285599409
A dark horse.	315.11035104020533
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	300.1743055778089
— Mind, Joe, says I.	175.10778714357306
Show us the entrance out.	456.09374684776077
— There you are, says Terry.	250.93281233807608
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	706.2811235921189
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	923.3597186681905
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	1278.0659880411893
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	1473.0341691893473
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	844.2430256804648
Give us a bloody chance.	533.1320502901018
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	712.465044813793
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	667.409761925596
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	1213.6181470002714
Loans by post on easy terms.	1447.7803974372073
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	853.0183127853276
Distance no object.	856.4082262249754
No security.	429.09898840324206
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	536.9460339020143
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	224.36239956550764
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	267.0437531527538
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	1054.4212163591856
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	2646.5647450131587
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	540.7375610886853
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	1766.6119700981444
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	1062.210379354306
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	633.4464909309397
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	1112.862041700147
Look to our steeds.	568.8311261410674
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	633.9900443653362
I know not what to offer your lordships.	553.9212992210682
— How now, fellow?	247.58584738427984
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	754.1359747934279
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	1480.73236778291
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	550.735262264912
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	837.7628310755057
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	991.2707866043625
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	786.4792817582365
Hast aught to give us?	1236.980658181531
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	1309.2084844931105
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	694.6472862706775
That likes me well.	419.1507465413093
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	659.3442924856223
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	991.5544113719146
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	556.2394982158943
— Where is he?	185.61907060057595
says Lenehan.	164.09320026805327
Defrauding widows and orphans.	1658.688953526387
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	473.12489672799455
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	171.4328402830511
Or so they allege.	651.4678919690583
— I, says Joe.	112.0294812712441
I ’ m the alligator.	212.38539226033387
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	498.8315891146727
— Why not?	225.58711415501242
says J.	138.67706160209988
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	592.1515085233322
says Ned.	183.20722192663123
Or who is he?	274.97893539695224
No offence, Crofton.	528.2149767508864
— Who is Junius?	599.5182310948487
says J.	138.67706160209988
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	682.8240390986524
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	482.7987873184469
We know that in the castle.	208.66563941431704
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	387.3531470471011
says Jack Power.	392.3070010047841
— Not at all, says Martin.	207.994329290496
Only namesakes.	834.3472305783472
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	377.9566674216449
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	352.2140120917435
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	316.697355922635
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	709.071756491748
For that matter so are we.	380.19693106544685
— Yes, says J.	156.40781975639482
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	410.01996692649817
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	412.41146989290917
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	592.3717971232988
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	350.0817957621399
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	1128.453398643926
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	1808.7800026582686
J.	78.32022695006061
— Do you call that a man?	278.30089333502536
says the citizen.	117.37307592871822
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	334.2534679235488
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	595.3363357866826
— And who does he suspect?	534.2840661593324
says the citizen.	117.37307592871822
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	568.0461540658735
One of those mixed middlings he is.	573.9832705998956
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	1044.2449269506062
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	422.8422300288223
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	311.425274727868
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	801.2277809383602
Give us your blessing.	673.4629486553952
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	335.67885874122203
But where is he?	244.02028922895838
We can ’ t wait.	309.83005522792814
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	399.04296634133897
That ’ s what he is.	130.3372628847268
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	898.6544853525
Cursed by God.	469.332746079765
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	560.1335731346468
says Ned.	183.20722192663123
— Only one, says Martin.	246.29572432728628
We must be quick.	414.23560996629084
J.	78.32022695006061
J.	78.32022695006061
and S.	79.85840594845018
— You, Jack?	208.8934465057058
Crofton?	488.65236562763494
Three half ones, Terry.	649.0737254809657
— Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	1048.093494885274
— Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	373.2053654264854
God bless all here is my prayer.	668.7214000334301
— Amen, says the citizen.	193.98535737392055

And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	1251.303403512562

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.	1486.9553812450258
And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	1508.2612882725998
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	2368.647123569464
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	853.835557535576
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	1000.8601199542265
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	576.339816706691
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	7499.8452936983995
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	561.8287169754243
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	489.5784267582076
And butter for fish.	437.78538637225154
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	617.5124546093691
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	228.01351512225685
I hope I ’ m not...	121.00631605403034
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	291.62930992948293
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	888.6348927089473
Mean bloody scut.	1832.7923992083695
Stand us a drink itself.	639.0169924012808
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	503.63896552718927
Cute as a shithouse rat.	1231.766530926523
Hundred to five.	384.3518316507156
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	317.17351979579473
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	416.83237843157383
Come along now.	316.11585514483664
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	385.67507263611816
It ’ s a secret.	160.7549788262026
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	654.1865728437986
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	566.65433205077
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	495.5675410379475
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	258.28323792290627
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	1501.050034017352
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	1528.3576621725747
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	907.1075060208211
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	658.8907734070392
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	695.6267799799517
— Let me alone, says he.	223.3497577551517
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	779.2865718265351
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	894.3732148577934
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	480.1311301438492
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	825.2621289641147
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	290.4380204165586
Your God.	248.10281360138302
— He had no father, says Martin.	238.23124098104387
That ’ ll do now.	236.3201711041855
Drive ahead.	1106.2884715782523
— Whose God?	516.5781311460338
says the citizen.	117.37307592871822
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	214.05007731084632
Your God was a jew.	325.73007817120117
Christ was a jew like me.	300.15114109161465
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	483.84830483441647
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	597.9656215360009
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	414.0984290677517
Give us that biscuitbox here.	740.7953038430155
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	489.1528068803966
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	1702.890790739927
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	1612.5117445325936
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	2082.8137344010315
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	1310.1579217955014
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	1751.2036786706965
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	1865.5456217271042
And Ned and J.	211.45701571938267
J.	78.32022695006061
paralysed with the laughing.	297.36558439942394
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	348.62065100054986
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	412.91593109601024
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	235.4755790147599
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	830.8552774243379
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	350.7683478363381
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	661.1535541112224
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	969.0337137088922
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	910.9139001014287
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	1131.550268599883
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	1821.9608078934768
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	1127.2670853562659
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	2169.988722507275
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	1576.2761085674342
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	3990.5519410810566
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	2240.4510936449474
The work of salvage, removal of _débris, _ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, <NUM> Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	1656.0263691578534

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he ’ d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	836.8977058724845
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	1318.6722698112958
What?	128.2987952047132
O, Jesus, he did.	134.8368958769121
And he let a volley of oaths after him.	473.89521512500806
— Did I kill him, says he, or what?	269.8295295331372
And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	772.7551719988206
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	323.45706662577106
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	945.3559950095002
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	806.5117460317903
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	1262.659067477273
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	1263.0090100618304
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	972.7967094970016
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	842.7691261065588
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	1358.2331309742635

For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	1716.9268437759342
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	911.7478557595023
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	1483.9108055517136
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	981.7016818784807
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	1066.1144559465008
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	351.83503953511024
Say out big, big.	331.3948674037662
I want a drink of water.	216.98887606838105
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	1151.9853372636735
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	1508.91831640636
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	992.0567542642931
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	1739.0076773083642
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	922.5137338634029
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	937.894832464241
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	1146.660956442874
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	1403.0983559096271
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	1234.9618131787538
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	1206.2833233230408
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	568.86221507687
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	607.4139489916957
Wait till I catch you for that.	326.5663007261422
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	1067.3263053448695
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	518.5857668345559
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	1061.55762233293
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	864.5798961384277
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	1017.1277591919471
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	825.9606232967144
Butter and cream?	783.3407129431127
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	1149.7884620821062
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	664.6374706870082
Cissy queried.	510.28757004960534
— Nao, Tommy said.	300.2221728761156
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	1034.7246325262483
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	361.71776361476986
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	450.1655162236914
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	451.1504670198839
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	1029.4150952351795
But who was Gerty?	393.3504809344886
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	979.0545861719261
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	757.984152198318
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	1298.8239719385865
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	2082.6813850229014
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	1594.5220131883243
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	737.8986060724399
No. Honour where honour is due.	721.6941353739047
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	2544.5366233506506
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	1503.974372349107
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	960.2187483107845
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	920.044018404417
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	1108.7598694666322
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	1541.6379695399526
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	1278.2549957238557
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	1267.0010994374722
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	752.2889979019942
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	968.3216258475393
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	441.70089495835816
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	1035.1236629555926
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	1177.0643323682777
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	1088.9506808194653
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	651.9775719641326
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	925.2209531549383
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	859.6890890708465
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	786.0504578902271
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	708.9029291931583
E.	145.31432739865093
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	1504.8470779114975
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	1121.0793538153887
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	502.87755179666635
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	919.6757868233686
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	652.385334627417
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	778.1487984530933
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	1862.4468382742411
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	1654.998744371871
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	1169.57816819796
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	628.0037294337421
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	1695.8058279600905
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	3555.420626833118
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	1155.380283539378
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	1485.7239536923378
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	826.5512682451948
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	727.2683294516036
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	966.8970578587841
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	210.65527144264928
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	1397.1075785854991
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	1034.5296637147926
C.	105.94139119590463
D.	140.90812251806926
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	1330.323609271165
He was too young to understand.	256.3883625535053
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	330.41027410112554
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	659.1353384093609
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	635.917811038046
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	1467.5553409299853
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	560.2309062337933
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	987.0262125198557
It would be like heaven.	355.0597045949708
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	1555.6700075891033
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	644.6287880643905
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	829.0353684296589
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	781.3405054556418
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	1194.7738217136634
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	1648.3729174582443
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	669.5299845979669
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	565.6882773790229
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	490.1311388278994
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	342.52750668260046
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	461.29744138508244
It ’ s my ball.	212.63794414025097
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	841.7114625295781
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	658.4740769420673
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	769.4943381149117
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	1102.168293844336
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	249.22955951480972
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	803.70832268937
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	977.5320252606472
But not a pin cared Ciss.	945.3694934918607
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	595.2620756586521
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	347.8589927399076
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	2342.696716996334
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	347.4748425693927
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	950.1995812332195
That was just like Cissycums.	515.0803790685654
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	669.0068051819901
There was none to come up to her for fun.	357.7425013361224
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	845.0788096606768
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	543.4992998410384
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	814.9869255259035
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	627.1783328196375
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	1078.7639742549445
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	1064.1936625839835
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	1141.6802207992164
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	2381.765826151073
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	748.3347600805873
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	1184.8981495583523
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	1107.7132686549132
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	696.1538281064026
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	1513.0778368560857
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	677.66049056852
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	455.4226446825855
Now he was laid to rest.	319.5783190184363
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	701.905665727436
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	848.6890271997471
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	1218.2004445492873
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	510.2479004808418
You could see there was a story behind it.	354.6980224595424
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	731.1202609461064
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	1319.690785677634
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	1624.6822632033147
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	1088.042657541286
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	1499.8424647513837
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	1017.7877281817114
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	748.7226373391188
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	1063.9612042312176
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	959.9447228966345
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	858.3430431490718
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	1127.0380469912302
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	1322.6301591290548
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	1612.7826269516424
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	1700.6078655035105
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	743.5511605554893
— Say papa, baby.	453.86434703354394
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	5179.289091561276
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	621.3731551309203
— Haja ja ja haja.	4011.6340289423797
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	1123.1616754270233
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	1521.595840204284
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	768.4726710445344
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	660.10052960233
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	602.4811934965943
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	990.8896504920378
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	205.28225506456096
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	669.485061815711
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	1014.9733848314082
People were so queer.	653.6923384428175
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	919.2688162017879
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	384.0948012244962
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	470.13820012388436
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	680.5579259627476
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	912.5152148251836
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	456.1554167195784
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	706.5975032317352
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	657.4744832429803
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	1142.9912606935716
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	1499.5014989064123
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	790.134770476896
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	740.3766666658873
Refuge of sinners.	819.4253490255151
Comfortress of the afflicted.	412.755682599832
_Ora pro nobis_.	2917.577080842408
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	1146.377200712348
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	786.8683728667463
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	1010.3519342560477
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	618.4155547557401
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	846.0727860551985
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	1082.1136822113901
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	2144.693971414973
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	508.96787285898375
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	718.1069481319895
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	637.8693424335968
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	772.5018277686673
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	853.0958748216216
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	1215.5812888989838
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	770.0350173379304
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	1035.5355539908267
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	582.9616800852589
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	883.9764808574322
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	1034.1087612354538
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	485.98182892264845
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	1115.4648530282095
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	1018.5064682047193
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	731.8564039975208
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	827.7063880419486
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	980.6457073557103
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	823.8466971507941
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	406.5246829074063
— What?	133.89864297395368
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	886.0733239936446
I was only wondering was it late.	380.46050914309166
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	1015.666241064391
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	574.2561576381546
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	555.1705200614463
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	500.4923699468697
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	491.5828865483533
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	1173.7712998623074
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	860.3917319832376
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	666.7678651610349
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	908.7751279186355
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	591.1096411339332
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	800.2206933327966
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	453.5423349294072
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	663.3646696185225
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	1498.4931198990557
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	594.0739805019283
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	260.83838670236094
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	1073.617916106092
Gerty winced sharply.	1743.7910291501337
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	2139.464722413435
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	975.3233033395777
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	1216.4556303712534
She had loved him better than he knew.	508.8074861417284
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	847.6281707747871
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	1433.7395975917857
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	519.2024940890617
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	567.0953153448993
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	1161.9635676512748
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	388.67672333056134
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	998.3228943721049
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	952.9188593629578
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	877.8907784190714
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	931.9465334832123
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	1017.0450580057012
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	1402.2246123025977
He has his bib destroyed.	674.8201048885578
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	1536.7826893397978
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	1138.8185638829807
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	1002.0175076614725
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	1634.391128094151
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	549.1308186009622
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	1072.8562669027967
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	1163.3916102032053
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	1048.7761689957658
But it must end, she felt.	327.8894418743397
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	672.5807351076015
Love laughs at locksmiths.	1263.1868089285524
She would make the great sacrifice.	505.74981129655885
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	926.4862202516309
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	721.8454878921159
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	649.53393916926
But even if — what then?	416.93211519726776
Would it make a very great difference?	848.9415712895182
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	2475.4883285769615
No, no: not that.	127.16926637666565
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	788.2441954340208
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	636.5254926690119
She thought she understood.	451.36702277186146
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	700.276160197535
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	674.721984976028
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	369.8052711324835
Nothing else mattered.	1411.1560992008233
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	626.0256353437061
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	1189.5412077037147
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	348.70624710575294
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	641.9718405995733
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	271.60227810872095
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	320.4722116431173
But Gerty was adamant.	639.0851401972699
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	616.6694101605107
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	772.9865963668462
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	1240.9802354885007
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	357.43059331919176
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	420.70191776428584
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	801.1868831769111
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	570.7241937679307
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	934.9941614496546
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	707.9318441954184
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	913.9704833954653
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	537.6943665963781
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	817.8608777852876
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	737.7142018167937
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	965.8236939607901
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	1143.048082436026
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	493.3682434889819
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	682.9786078540659
What a brute he had been! At it again?	478.74107974794236
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	511.2195001644106
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	866.1582119436016
Should a girl tell?	776.7167860949976
No, a thousand times no.	265.6419613774539
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	809.8089853627553
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	748.6013352784156
Come on.	117.37628846619381
We can see from farther up.	470.86448156667683
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	441.7402638034996
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	858.6039699144454
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	242.36492240513232
She rose.	200.47790489853745
Was it goodbye?	649.9553625561713
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	443.3227373951724
She drew herself up to her full height.	664.9777973074752
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	1039.6608799464245
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	860.361583209168
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	807.8978235388482
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	876.0585857432866
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	689.3035795880687
Tight boots?	966.2318074230768
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	523.2097964943388
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	450.314733010077
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	618.4811418564012
Jilted beauty.	786.7729935902106
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	703.5278852626296
But makes them polite.	661.9248598707927
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	412.1196490198609
Hot little devil all the same.	490.99231079687337
I wouldn ’ t mind.	243.0365396937306
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	774.6090916435596
That squinty one is delicate.	770.379929125816
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	1045.043782347429
I have such a bad headache today.	570.3110769755787
Where did I put the letter?	353.54511080896367
Yes, all right.	134.599337114683
All kinds of crazy longings.	1360.8393715808536
Licking pennies.	1132.9651678195964
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	1879.6579360950386
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	577.2257312145981
How many women in Dublin have it today?	655.0108233115408
Martha, she.	133.092431796439
Something in the air.	172.51055721156575
That ’ s the moon.	134.79483157403234
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	584.5096589333198
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	440.70954460283684
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	857.5422477234978
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	836.3725511429593
Anyhow I got the best of that.	234.5935403751025
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	811.2634506916734
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	745.9144706055315
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	1002.1966825812823
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	610.351823306394
Thankful for small mercies.	1592.7835315505502
Yours for the asking.	357.9345123291748
Because they want it themselves.	436.24034857221375
Their natural craving.	1291.1034915692087
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	938.7265867849972
Reserve better.	645.3356490622084
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	331.3370817718388
Catch em alive, O.	804.2794884460275
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	498.1158917344605
A dream of wellfilled hose.	987.7037477835067
Where was that?	182.98408888221402
Ah, yes.	148.00854975881995
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	976.6381146086363
Peeping Tom.	673.6651193106577
Willy ’ s hat and what the girls did with it.	276.85510602932027
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	873.2067282101623
_Lingerie_ does it.	493.57406888594136
Felt for the curves inside her <URL> Excites them also when they ’ re.	923.7980061177504
I ’ m all clean come and dirty me.	362.8424742100255
Milly delighted with Molly ’ s new blouse.	758.1890295974013
At first.	217.87133183503246
Put them all on to take them all off.	347.3315716632645
Molly.	110.76341078027173
Why I bought her the violet garters.	541.8596351633535
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	849.491458699384
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	551.832912656663
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	993.994585514886
of jet.	147.54986196120393
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	1064.5706604024838
Pinned together.	671.5762100749604
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	312.76165028332935
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	629.9063398429194
Fashion part of their charm.	810.0366493957481
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	454.6118211283826
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	529.9496552454434
No reasonable offer refused.	2230.9461063510435
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	444.4148247767655
Always off to a fellow when they are.	330.15242222385115
They never forget an appointment.	882.2876934821163
Out on spec probably.	1058.6933359765171
They believe in chance because like themselves.	646.6985554657794
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	736.7578288600508
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	1318.2353597475555
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	1046.7113376546083
Barbed wire.	1132.9651678195964
Be sure now and write to me.	387.57516609741873
Now won ’ t you?	367.9522270811653
Molly and Josie Powell.	740.8037887930043
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	928.493542889889
_Tableau! _ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	354.13151543067676
What have you been doing with yourself?	554.9749145225879
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	286.14645901846256
Picking holes in each other ’ s appearance.	844.1779704847708
You ’ re looking splendid.	490.0633269126793
Sister souls.	588.3569439232161
Showing their teeth at one another.	729.1130377875517
How many have you left?	507.12689814562543
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	933.5581997478532
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	406.562701888959
Dark devilish appearance.	2195.085732695896
Scratch the sole of my foot.	502.7839766500921
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	369.3412041294924
Good to rest once in a way.	283.3864813566485
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	299.5012988467734
Safe in one way.	296.19801246027964
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	1883.6835223771766
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	877.7829532854873
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	868.2198410055107
Daresay she felt I.	428.51026732615185
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	579.651734341387
Liked me or what?	611.9923208504831
Dress they look at.	441.09483460686806
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	1203.1830945441732
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	809.6919450814396
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	1616.8461956246317
Trousers?	537.831520434236
Suppose I when I was?	264.24407402969445
No. Gently does it.	333.6771394777521
Dislike rough and tumble.	1209.0571477699102
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	320.4960337982504
Saw something in me.	321.99941924440225
Wonder what.	203.98721547276017
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	2204.0747861400328
To aid gentleman in literary.	736.0732481267856
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	926.739122358736
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	483.7615076991963
Still, you never know.	201.62103118446072
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	1744.4334092494582
Beauty and the beast.	291.9273297660671
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	433.31200888000393
Wide brim.	1347.3302386213154
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	905.4312198646995
Hair strong in rut.	1001.128008897523
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	727.0803335516732
Why not?	248.9049987843164
Suppose he gave her money.	392.53628993454737
Why not?	248.9049987843164
All a prejudice.	359.2399251016861
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	317.2314813729412
What?	128.2987952047132
I think so.	143.39372127786785
All that for nothing.	203.16832823017137
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	690.4188812890009
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	744.6728226260678
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	403.75342042347876
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	483.8811850272012
No, I remember.	135.80014086770927
Richie Goulding: he ’ s another.	293.99973056043
Weighs on his mind.	405.70742209692565
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	1234.9801635842018
Dust.	266.9555776457352
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	1640.0353896957106
Could do it myself.	400.7171514812502
Save.	219.45635629992586
Was that just when he, she?	261.80141704660963
O, he did.	89.84129924762038
Into her.	252.90514860230456
She did.	131.81901726121734
Done.	238.63253457126893
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	1053.104772480875
O Lord, that little limping devil.	583.2285483820399
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	853.1820910538815
Aftereffect not pleasant.	830.7990976411724
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	476.1176934093017
They don ’ t care.	323.1007934030722
Complimented perhaps.	715.12411059843
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	1187.8140569026616
Well, aren ’ t they?	365.2361868525086
See her as she is spoil all.	411.0856948344019
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	526.3701285379583
The name too.	166.85228857357336
_Amours_ of actresses.	755.5985972051031
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.	2252.3901282590214
Curtain up.	381.8485382092954
Moonlight silver effulgence.	1924.8830192306193
Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	2008.4749178630393
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	698.5690667218971
Still, I feel.	158.23242743329777
The strength it gives a man.	351.5813542662384
That ’ s the secret of it.	126.65148410500218
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	467.1723643066371
Cider that was.	239.8885099718219
Otherwise I couldn ’ t have.	397.67967490844626
Makes you want to sing after.	531.4274614618395
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	4274.478069695876
Suppose I spoke to her.	264.00160876792273
What about?	195.58103449272366
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	834.8100455449451
Ask them a question they ask you another.	605.0827617735882
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	538.5068034600632
Gain time.	468.15862401503944
But then you ’ re in a cart.	283.1626078307875
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	816.894823131678
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	871.1462665281168
All the dirty things I made her say.	381.0969897305973
All wrong of course.	284.04743429793706
My arks she called it.	636.4515660705324
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	318.38195363272666
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	1326.1029959814612
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	600.6766637745535
Parrots.	362.3144614049264
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	376.63227185601653
Taking a man from another woman.	444.50143386133414
Or even hear of it.	267.60933425294485
Different with me.	270.1854813602964
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	502.53693984281136
Eating off his cold plate.	888.6087089765826
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	2284.229761343464
French letter still in my pocketbook.	732.8899688303658
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	582.9350705308104
Come in, all is prepared.	225.10056459353163
I dreamt.	218.984062986942
What?	128.2987952047132
Worst is beginning.	616.2942075945674
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	388.3864039407038
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	813.1185911820911
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	634.1979488821971
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	368.60628217928826
Because I did.	195.00884572087696
She too.	124.92045564483213
Offend her.	318.0113883914681
Then make it up.	219.14822625138862
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	791.3269718163023
Flatters them.	398.86075855575444
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	514.1334203603907
What harm?	442.9766553999531
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	212.51887771925163
First kiss does the trick.	674.3583560442211
The propitious moment.	495.6819366850637
Something inside them goes pop.	1281.1335020565489
First thoughts are best.	742.2350609919663
Remember that till their dying day.	607.520065315181
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	1038.598424116831
But her breasts were developed.	762.4172127253986
Fell asleep then.	869.1507732652897
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	1044.4191751100643
Featherbed mountain.	883.8439977967795
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	663.0239119871563
Val Dillon.	739.8196898751404
Apoplectic.	362.3144614049264
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	301.1449320193453
My fireworks.	424.2714601677227
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	436.70666148373357
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	417.6400707517849
Want to be grownups.	540.4274922212293
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	416.45952424455055
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	334.26326963662956
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	387.04192276718226
I knew she could whistle.	389.80878065059466
Mouth made for that.	292.4133883944368
Like Molly.	304.16474495258717
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	445.5996671041891
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	313.5772790597302
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	2038.1487018691103
Caressing the little boy too.	457.6597048219186
Onlookers see most of the game.	486.12468428301275
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	887.835159768876
In their line.	269.48239120614267
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	476.11175703836227
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	501.6188109006642
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	870.1323869969889
Fine eyes she had, clear.	408.68373162736617
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	329.67448493822707
Did she know what I?	347.1713787533055
Course.	205.25706077185902
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	728.744226021275
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	974.7406309001327
Call that innocence?	1038.6745304742376
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	760.131389245459
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	1913.4264834795472
Eyes all over them.	344.37427473557676
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	272.16229670302124
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	549.4885831586388
Sharp as needles they are.	865.4167854694407
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	553.0343520924198
Had, too.	149.0238893886081
Where do they get that?	363.60651434885693
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	1146.1726169848596
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	367.48509769551174
Bred in the bone.	381.3681332893565
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	929.4211131136369
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	474.0391734267821
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	817.7010540876303
I never told her.	176.68741481144465
Attract men, small thing like that.	535.8302979033407
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	480.4746155768453
Who did you learn that from?	435.505542487446
Nobody.	251.21481667538362
Something the nurse taught me.	594.1464843710116
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	649.3444985065922
Me have a nice pace.	550.4356450868773
Mullingar.	199.38933213025123
Who knows?	430.2340849984916
Ways of the world.	228.21720754141325
Young student.	559.6148591681133
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	686.5751570378008
Still she was game.	362.39347099814904
Lord, I am wet.	271.5980821141246
Devil you are.	293.22069000674315
Swell of her calf.	463.6195901330303
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	1153.7583066512925
Not like that frump today.	678.3747845571492
A.	53.193264159879526
E.	145.31432739865093
Rumpled stockings.	871.977628915354
Or the one in Grafton street.	322.1738670094394
White.	199.38933213025123
Wow! Beef to the heel.	671.1868336426264
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	979.8716840735054
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	590.5396607055817
Will she?	319.4702257582333
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	1056.6192610637645
She smelt an onion.	911.330054236516
Darling, I saw, your.	200.26634720392695
I saw all.	118.85150356301916
Lord! Did me good all the same.	334.66005369274666
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	427.0605771192194
For this relief much thanks.	986.7021507101709
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	208.00402461751565
Lord! It was all things combined.	607.5517130215065
Excitement.	362.3144614049264
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	745.5750928003428
Your head it simply swirls.	915.6608488180143
He ’ s right.	106.95867389667171
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	792.6894774641066
Instead of talking about nothing.	596.50163738385
Then I will tell you all.	252.675230868948
Still it was a kind of language between us.	363.15826515324125
It couldn ’ t be?	341.8231907380382
No, Gerty they called her.	258.7815702816167
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	849.6502589896699
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	1418.7587203408061
Place made me think of that I suppose.	403.7937556755358
All tarred with the same brush.	634.9507155558597
Wiping pens in their stockings.	1171.5543735165388
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	438.52552035898583
Every bullet has its billet.	2022.8860629538906
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	1150.1394931869695
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	631.8100595060796
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	1449.7194454794544
No soft job.	463.12488468127987
Saves them.	398.86075855575444
Nature.	238.63253457126893
Washing child, washing corpse.	1158.5865007581008
Dignam.	108.73059404071822
Children ’ s hands always round them.	462.3468981805279
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	1623.830803264245
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	1065.567733637943
Fill it up with wind.	397.510168365331
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	438.9454347501626
Must call to the hospital.	300.73591824091164
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	959.484393484089
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	907.0323849468242
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	1075.5172957113575
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	632.6299923638983
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	830.9386933541776
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	1046.6593888178925
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	518.0724804704788
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	473.6596438577605
Chickens come home to roost.	1152.9418094523887
They stick by one another like glue.	789.0195229217751
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	496.6775490908891
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	738.894270343611
It ’ s the blood of the south.	160.77513719975767
Moorish.	228.24380830269533
Also the form, the figure.	202.83711414768868
Hands felt for the opulent.	559.0844629677789
Just compare for instance those others.	1107.4612332782906
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	758.6533868600412
Allow me to introduce my.	573.5216516264444
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	500.34724780851946
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	437.4835457088968
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	322.5721624852967
Have their own secrets between them.	789.6335983723895
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	589.8092065652957
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	769.6814773614374
As God made them he matched them.	662.1464618004417
Twice nought makes one.	1177.6776722453646
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	1324.497340198768
Marry in May and repent in December.	970.1295705796305
This wet is very unpleasant.	952.7219034312482
Stuck.	266.9555776457352
Well the foreskin is not back.	394.0989476602748
Better detach.	811.4666184969553
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	977.7876312594617
Long and the short of it.	159.13538107741556
Very strange about my watch.	771.6751314627986
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	1049.381750618318
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	595.0476497997346
Yes, I suppose, at once.	167.52250156648282
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	466.0601266770208
I remember looking in Pill lane.	699.8446191541195
Also that now is magnetism.	543.9872779605673
Back of everything magnetism.	869.093746570548
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	1199.3419892391016
That causes movement.	834.4059224632776
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	241.07478978123083
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	1131.570154836406
Because it ’ s all arranged.	292.12838276784584
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	504.4487724143762
Little piece of steel iron.	983.876411112349
When you hold out the fork.	417.0081345245283
Come.	101.86261728670831
Come.	101.86261728670831
Woman and man that is.	189.51451656344844
Fork and steel.	549.4900699272952
Molly, he.	81.82629835113713
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	442.64371171152357
Tip.	316.5108355747976
Have to let fly.	445.87493694151885
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	563.9105678340981
Shame all put on before third person.	870.5653704279761
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	547.4185260561062
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	553.7458512049212
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	695.5198703686101
Fine voice that fellow had.	445.6392804956742
How Giuglini began.	954.8545761099434
Smell that I did.	252.38575012439074
Like flowers.	385.9601295527277
It was too.	138.32004027276065
Violets.	362.3144614049264
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	820.9833796061495
Make their own use of everything.	667.0503082857922
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	874.3795557444851
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	458.3057782818213
Keep that thing up for hours.	426.5806140129635
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	439.31795911197133
Wait.	118.6143906508203
Hm. Hm. Yes.	288.2388170128273
That ’ s her perfume.	198.41008195682798
Why she waved her hand.	466.4948913318166
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	367.08211815115743
What is it?	156.27123387422753
Heliotrope?	775.6872792440565
No. Hyacinth?	374.21113137294384
Hm. Roses, I think.	342.7455883379856
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	351.34776509748036
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	945.9209388678382
Why Molly likes opoponax.	1398.6126691069944
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	588.4795855316315
Her high notes and her low notes.	841.6912812540103
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	413.68755621314614
Heat brought it out.	462.3077918716101
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	281.2041890313211
Good conductor, is it?	351.8907182776242
Or bad?	505.2040973382012
Light too.	294.5473485130521
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	445.0542541337851
Mysterious thing too.	548.2627795405673
Why did I smell it only now?	508.72124633092255
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	789.4962250610666
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	1311.5018680899047
Yes, it is.	88.87777327970124
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	1575.1400981001905
Tell you what it is.	209.3876360686422
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	719.1053239521816
Clings to everything she takes off.	805.9206073983263
Warm shoe.	910.25641350066
Stays.	362.3144614049264
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	638.3396928548875
Byby till next time.	850.3100153713535
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	633.4643086195367
Know her smell in a thousand.	399.4047412390982
Bathwater too.	451.0719175306458
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	680.5403058224199
There or the armpits or under the neck.	370.9237617819805
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	460.8671052032688
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	1116.4250862337756
Muskrat.	362.3144614049264
Bag under their tails.	953.212830781366
One grain pour off odour for years.	1496.6796873028215
Dogs at each other behind.	682.0667584700514
Good evening.	306.93245960007386
Evening.	251.21481667538362
How do you sniff?	739.9361591275934
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	482.4783978942893
Yes now, look at it that way.	217.29683550925805
We ’ re the same.	191.9525254664898
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	694.803768686927
Come near.	247.8680190897202
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	726.9021660161801
Like what?	331.30590722320136
Potted herrings gone stale or.	1790.2271585446758
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	1041.092294634631
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	555.3529857414062
What though?	262.11164464743393
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	779.3799836861625
Breath?	677.625253892059
What you eat and drink gives that.	409.8379015255367
No. Mansmell, I mean.	250.14333187607767
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different.	782.0273906253368
Women buzz round it like flies round treacle.	1858.7985904142254
Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost.	630.3795835963618
The tree of forbidden priest.	690.2566972920436
O, father, will you?	162.66573762200775
Let me be the first to.	171.35672272110793
That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates.	809.1319854990329
Source of life.	333.1661673760676
And it ’ s extremely curious the smell.	415.0575848054715
Celery sauce.	1287.2969652097265
Let me.	154.3799351874812
Mr Bloom inserted his nose.	421.45355066851096
Hm. Into the.	257.5509978080689
Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.	434.75572621304445
Almonds or.	371.9339052313732
No. Lemons it is.	242.62902244002825

Circus horse walking in a ring.	729.4651458577513
Rip van Winkle we played.	2086.5509306612444
Rip: tear in Henny Doyle ’ s overcoat.	1146.8563981494835
Van: breadvan delivering.	1884.071163758267
Winkle: cockles and periwinkles.	932.2507960095588
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	1287.1266811064029
She leaned on the sideboard watching.	644.0010019151547
Moorish eyes.	339.7910537759434
Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.	2098.0443675871384

His gun rusty from the dew.	890.3965082978829
Ba. What is that flying about?	468.5441774670701
Swallow?	775.6872792440565
Thinks I ’ m a tree, so blind.	425.5085191390406
Have birds no smell?	1207.4940777745867

They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief.	887.1041310730913
Weeping willow.	1530.8627101488164
Ba. There he goes.	333.88035465540815
Funny little beggar.	893.1992484316452
Wonder where he lives.	439.44575219214096
Belfry up there.	415.4620482623227
Very likely.	577.1450093266562
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	567.3481617745597
Bell scared him out, I suppose.	540.4333300127669
Mass seems to be over.	568.2223292572942
Could hear them all at it.	323.78617921709156
Pray for us.	308.2777643798402
And pray for us.	294.91222292154833
And pray for us.	294.91222292154833

Two houses they have.	426.31000941190865
Gabriel Conroy ’ s brother is curate.	957.6633700298623
Ba. Again.	386.75282746479655
Wonder why they come out at night like mice.	789.7694806033211
They ’ re a mixed breed.	566.039892925834
Birds are like hopping mice.	1724.2659318652475
What frightens them, light or noise?	772.8319040592679
Better sit still.	606.7232849935358
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	776.3455641301913
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	425.3396091332369
Weeny bones.	919.9931611682318
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.	714.1608719305951
Colours depend on the light you see.	641.4089134413434
Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	1561.044415607115
Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.	469.46920373259786
Colour of brown turf.	871.8055044073176
Not true.	276.7442608512594
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	1339.7638843283225
Body fifty different colours.	2099.320679782068
Howth a while ago amethyst.	1051.0830425725624
Glass flashing.	941.156257994358
That ’ s how that wise man what ’ s his name with the burning glass.	386.6734454215179
Then the heather goes on fire.	594.2819873604883
It can ’ t be tourists ’ matches.	587.1533943548403
What?	128.2987952047132
Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.	849.8194223016998
Archimedes.	362.3144614049264
I have it! My memory ’ s not so bad.	318.27099321713234
Ba. Who knows what they ’ re always flying for.	630.7034921285539
Insects?	677.625253892059
Might be the one bit me, come back to see.	283.16295204937535
Birds too.	358.7242925809479
Never find out.	346.0602738103289
Or what they say.	295.81069594544346
Like our small talk.	804.1912827742844
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	556.1998083794703
Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.	1646.65878288929
Dreadful life sailors have too.	994.7594973836923
Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	1742.5580080287339
_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	1093.6775217513798
Married too.	329.7833906726549
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	506.23825053418153
No ends really because it ’ s round.	449.58862386938665
Wife in every port they say.	698.8774035600483
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	1323.7722675147802
If ever he does.	317.5328006261532
Smelling the tail end of ports.	955.8002788688123
How can they like the sea?	358.36318378870527
Yet they do.	299.1140106608603
The anchor ’ s weighed.	421.6464203627917
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	786.0301240886855
Well.	100.39676431040483
And the tephilim no what ’ s this they call it poor papa ’ s father had on his door to touch.	487.8756076977821
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	363.31119166290483
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	980.4577835907794
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	802.5716274107403
Do fish ever get seasick?	1826.8758010804693
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones ’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	1334.4009918048553
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	638.8456746921164
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	1375.376033358624
They floated, fell: they faded.	549.2993420151635
The shepherd ’ s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	586.5738186790073
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	1165.9627752264455
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	1328.683760691805
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	1243.098885719049
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	893.5653976321488
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	982.0636299193995
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	1102.1708619522888
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	1296.3137530413144
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	1492.4611432851345
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	674.7523268623708
Irish Lights board.	1197.543072943538
Penance for their sins.	677.0905878149555

Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat.	1657.4208463013028
Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin ’ s King, throwing them the sack of old papers.	684.7333627139874
Bears in the zoo.	506.6851576020555
Filthy trip.	1287.2969652097265
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	916.8054885044685
Puking overboard to feed the herrings.	1472.945670330742
Nausea.	362.3144614049264
And the women, fear of God in their faces.	264.7179616426653
Milly, no sign of funk.	480.3887200718321
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	892.336051050741
Don ’ t know what death is at that age.	413.12346914141415
And then their stomachs clean.	710.4177592515556
But being lost they fear.	552.5543451835813
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	1096.0960194899642
I didn ’ t want to.	190.8061155110877
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	887.5403422267364
Frightening them with masks too.	839.1903341160516
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	394.5143454409457
I ’ ll murder you.	211.66486501269833
Is it only half fun?	810.2503154351607
Or children playing battle.	1369.3764775925438
Whole earnest.	1041.5606143351663
How can people aim guns at each other.	1490.8227345629423
Sometimes they go off.	497.23471070735565
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	2703.056191943533
After getting better asleep with Molly.	966.951834478526
Very same teeth she has.	639.7415771335836
What do they love?	368.21298554044097
Another themselves?	824.4233758441862
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	369.26897128143594
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	429.47930498696195
I felt her pulse.	414.86386761656564
Ticking.	362.3144614049264
Little hand it was: now big.	343.45774919965686

Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	1475.0461027183533
Her first stays I remember.	616.8421805214831
Made me laugh to see.	459.29030209764875
Little paps to begin with.	779.0011305134129
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	546.5833767423134
Nearer the heart?	531.5475124626131
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	958.7691582729236
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	515.8549663920471
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	641.6743273469609
Brings back her girlhood.	816.9740130560663

Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.	560.5318267061003

Got my own back there.	422.81439220330094

Mistake to hit back.	611.1169628868537
Or?	239.43834225390174
No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.	466.029705908216
Always want to be swilling in company.	699.9586207194777
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	396.04995742885274
Suppose he hit me.	436.6248961196574
Look at it other way round.	361.57761068101547
Not so bad then.	368.8243030853634
Perhaps not to hurt he meant.	559.8183764995692
Three cheers for Israel.	885.1808788298754
Three cheers for the sister - in - law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	836.207365664412

Anyhow she wants the money.	450.30470611461453
Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	1135.3414065765428
Strange name.	378.82973592767013
Takes it for granted we ’ re going to pop off first.	861.3698610115806
That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer ’ s that looked at me.	630.3819415868592
Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium.	1600.3905297621227

Well?	214.94171844774678
What do you expect her to do?	398.9930860175556
Must wheedle her way along.	762.1643536584406

Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	440.8040028937259
He brought it near his eyes and peered.	367.4170282127029
Letter?	571.5312739659532
No. Can ’ t read.	230.37729779735977
Better go.	257.57968112757374

Who could count them?	752.4970386301108
Never know what you find.	415.02999957796146

Bit of stick.	373.6131773947117
O! Exhausted that female has me.	528.6800193197289
Not so young now.	327.20560072411746

Murderers do.	467.81802093473414
Will I?	231.92075121577287
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	755.3379990772067
Write a message for her.	397.6932936786872
Might remain.	570.0794794117573

Tide comes here.	790.6988703902523
Saw a pool near her foot.	868.6104032452465
Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	530.7022301358169
All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	863.6874572046623
O, those transparent! Besides they don ’ t know.	489.78699756437743
What is the meaning of that other world.	241.7580931885677
I called you naughty boy because I do not like.	480.8674211248244

No room.	228.20753894082074
Let it go.	210.62691518003467
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	655.339573584064
Hopeless thing sand.	1003.9313821089393
Nothing grows in it.	389.19208657016367

Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn ’ t.	446.69379202539056
Chance.	362.3144614049264
We ’ ll never meet again.	457.44583757223

Race there, race back to Ennis.	637.8904828154742
Let him.	135.94124088262387
Just close my eyes a moment.	484.96203796002874
Won ’ t sleep, though.	353.6402556409361
Half dream.	581.0982883816357
It never comes the same.	298.8441476417673
Bat again.	520.2006954658831
No harm in him.	225.00471186955926

There.	83.22766030880874
Here.	114.12190415134765
Far in the grey a bell chimed.	581.5065475758062
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	770.8838884082495
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest ’ s house cooed where Canon O ’ Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	836.6044798644097

were taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup and talking about Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	2388.7836351993324
Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	708.8671869042499

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	3036.6531709756614
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	2373.4687198389884
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	1139.6733349970605
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O ’ Shiels, the O ’ Hickeys, the O ’ Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	1297.1598698330306
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	2282.40139060097
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	2035.8133839282336
O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt! Before born bliss babe had.	1453.3712300420825
Within womb won he worship.	1683.9487975608988
Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was.	958.5208755301132
A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.	2194.6771188774455
Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night ’ s oncoming.	1068.586837482403
Of Israel ’ s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared.	951.3418026382311
Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.	1396.3442918542746
Of that house A.	261.05335180625053
Horne is lord.	381.2363221979456
Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God ’ s angel to Mary quoth.	2561.6595608825965
Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless.	2300.962169659197
Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred.	2342.4372114694934
Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.	3031.989101912171
In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid.	3398.92773228344
Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland ’ s westward welkin.	2907.844574513554
Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	1693.766961075346
Christ ’ s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	1234.3954220637625
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne ’ s house.	883.839830106459
Loth to irk in Horne ’ s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	1224.9772339068668
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	1666.2217093605452
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	854.1470410539422
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.	696.5882367175911
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	1484.9378241863596
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	3041.8634756368274
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	822.3083771918991
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	1445.3336280764547
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	761.701953134823
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	1323.5331499811803
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	985.8396500816572
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	1019.4264817460764
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	683.4317453351579
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	1241.020625956994
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	697.3378609936026
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	437.1976386429043
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	628.5968765848894
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	771.347056784917
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	542.5097627038043
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	664.5054270873324
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	4583.64236528338
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	924.2353756871422
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	948.1520313318729
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	1409.68593949025
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	355.29540803816207
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	569.4489881954801
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	874.6758826041402
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	1164.6755437969975
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	1612.339719149954
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	876.8091034174585
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	1754.7497673619814
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	823.9989048786462
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	1766.301870340019
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	1400.6096889442067
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	1142.8201546872947
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	1118.6911944133494
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	981.5434034998475
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	1456.5977313706328
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	1430.3507514428097
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	436.0334981309218
Thanked be Almighty God.	1102.7052917857332
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	1613.764414207633
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	562.8983557706949
Meseems it dureth overlong.	2481.3219804438627
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	850.8578757140801
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	813.2908877107895
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	610.1748474097533
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	728.785998214549
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	1110.2414646425443
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	857.1374744893116
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	636.9973097126592
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	947.3513080970101
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	1141.1049868812545
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	764.1302695715065
For they were right witty scholars.	1022.0849801746527
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	1110.9532729211555
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	848.3635010148523
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	1167.9088316199645
A redress God grant.	1187.6326346067483
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	935.4728379341691
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	1508.509090565263
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	1527.8524537750332
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	2032.4251956334717
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	1204.7838929525117
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	1065.7732742642136
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	422.51956090851473
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	1267.0519557663606
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	1782.9180314943656
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	941.4367149473823
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	1308.530132524558
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	1496.3550187577457
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	1125.249528175189
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	1437.0695968418754
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	1049.5277428867262
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	1026.4004364728364
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	426.60761885876474
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	722.6015794421162
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	1243.2144893240654
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	1027.6798759847184
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	1335.5387968837088
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	1191.6591635058296
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	1140.8868071468564
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	1406.800882659478
See ye here.	594.1152471346142
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	784.7759458826145
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	1101.2094072679515
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions.	877.400952489746
What means this?	455.82072183066543
Desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	885.057861954314
Mark me now.	331.2173664016043
In woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	813.954092825251
This is the postcreation.	354.4596154594339
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	5557.211438312415
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	1700.0152349760892
But here is the matter now.	264.76285404352086
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	1197.9805415047165
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l ’ avait mise dans cette fichue position c ’ était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	11989.399904244972
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	562.2925426864173
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	892.3648387281129
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	1026.4048728373234
With will will we withstand, withsay.	926.6336155841669
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	2060.518388775194
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	1414.9188297348264
In Horne ’ s house rest should reign.	871.4948226828341
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	1211.1713273332575
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	1275.177193021459
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	688.309775966512
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	1805.8539418033538
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	1668.2563875225537
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	4788.771455545407
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	902.8238065214001
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	860.8103918309351
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	500.5428154782271
Go thou and do likewise.	750.7619804496684
Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden.	1494.699628217013

Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	1067.9820139790988
Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	1052.0129338429251
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	882.7671254512052
Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	942.2250221824813
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	1547.6084902659873
And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.	927.0582552363092
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell ’ s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.	1152.3279810577378

The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt ’ s plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_.	1067.5857739198673
And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.	1992.4881604917528
The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.	1379.6649334652707
First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage.	1052.4089987705881
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	1776.4629221427374
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	2312.3941804327505
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn ’ s bivouac.	2399.17299879695
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	602.7567709648121
Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	2117.851422988023
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	796.8130689454697
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	1500.6455002532837
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	1375.212783654131
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	1104.5278114904384
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	1263.212680204483
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	1031.3264906657353
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	903.6613745438145
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	1051.9022040640573
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	669.2728007612833
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	475.6831787689846
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	938.1467262690825
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	656.4932271441824
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	697.1338349393698
Heard?	571.5312739659532
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	660.9761747316476
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	520.2620982667215
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	570.0925840403294
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	1293.036565261789
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	1170.4085374279907
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	785.2336253834729
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	1440.2269523592472
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	1896.375790635051
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	1310.4055371138004
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	3098.364598598122
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	1676.2496391501293
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	1350.630625863608
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	1701.065142898811
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	998.2727926979144
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	1121.3671751318552
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	1481.1133209442448
Over against the Rt. Hon.	846.1631556289306

Mulligan a gentleman ’ s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore ’ s the writer ’ s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	650.6801315179919
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	829.5470938525059
There Leop.	507.95209654012245
Bloom of Crawford ’ s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy ’ s, Vin.	1054.629868639463

Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.	753.3832588043567
Leop.	316.5108355747976
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	893.385329593382
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	768.717886778367
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	1443.0822428125937
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	1350.4392553743671
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	598.7702496009242
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	1090.6583153495374
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	1056.6793146694629
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	526.3677899741616
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	546.381680730303
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	487.47637278803506
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	884.4322076687308
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	1298.2659650207515
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	1172.334338670787
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	853.734106295078
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	424.5079191332999
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	565.9077931158007
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	558.9290389825784
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	1879.5096017144879
I question with you there, says he.	159.78477027177223
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	857.2466993254793
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	977.6305444219327
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	517.9859033625056
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	759.300355304419
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	356.1159677964353
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	791.4092512762024
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	526.1482832318552
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	1000.7825703284055
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	839.7250980800757
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	694.0107772340976
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	793.0522563164435
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	869.419823998726
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	692.1559709926527
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	1256.1531521652244
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	569.3181766848846
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	1117.7585038012094
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	773.1190840699603
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	465.6307837656042
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	1112.8816273769978
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	584.7808304764231
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	819.5500440774697
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	588.0416099427765
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	1016.1338260091384
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	699.1347442320546
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	956.6611704751314
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	1366.5395325441734
Fertiliser and Incubator.	852.7237329271148
Lambay Island_.	1530.8627101488164
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	1501.8986631959456
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	337.5127911122236
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	894.1818267059937
Come, be seated, both.	242.17838166031999
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	757.8856680496531
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	1228.2519045948616
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	1749.758344377353
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	1836.9934582211647
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	1440.6659081883458
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	490.4420154773186
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	1277.7135598802931
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	2090.06047007465
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	1055.1923960639783
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	948.2395083290791
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	1721.1697808908834
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	3529.0100971593424
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	1420.5323684962814
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	707.5516665565169
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	661.0389931983649
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	747.9015526348529
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	1082.4115434819478
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	1336.6466370751964
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	1167.4821778954786
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	1109.012426123702
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	1102.3011091070575
That you may and very opportunely.	539.4365020999016
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	1192.0268652488912
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	626.2937164715811
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	1080.1913659262898
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	1131.2935764592135
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	339.6045459693473
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	1031.6162751287509
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	880.7883750580014
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	1413.2981679168206
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	320.13946444676435
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	1758.687332593139
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	918.8759889092231
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	748.0190921968921
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	652.4546468873826
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	935.4799486204657
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	1392.5377091488024
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	1412.585922303297
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	1535.331563604093
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	855.2968802591648
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	1347.4807716877003
No woman of any wit would wear one.	658.450726855178
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	493.9123257445306
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	1307.7689312197717
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	1041.7206489431746
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	1579.6660206056433
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	830.1854570794086
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	1128.1155238129177
What, you dog?	201.9659520619207
Have you a way with them?	270.5983574367393
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	618.6288735419265
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	998.5357759923435
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	772.4498108599589
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	548.4408419045321
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	731.0894199261058
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	1222.4247512589845
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	998.9941810916843
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	954.3293629279372
I cannot away with them.	283.0692057644246
What?	128.2987952047132
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	832.5272596741243
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	1279.3273567993474
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	929.4766246284435
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	778.609635850752
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	1305.8187510373398
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	1003.1907805882463
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	1115.3817953563507
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	1914.331189787903
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	1004.8487478558611
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	1476.4360608666477
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	1359.3023558526004
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	1482.3008604609029
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	985.9662277680242
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	989.0250640507594
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	907.6588149166045
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	940.8184199665399
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	1038.8853625324691
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	235.9091809378413
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	1054.971034052152
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	1027.5424610685027
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	2168.9148417959773
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	1116.1599651813951
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	1302.2401794307991
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	1710.3950010136596
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	1404.9956408306125
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	1483.006935906986
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	760.4491751364031
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	888.9753932310637
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	1457.2777337223406
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	1327.458020942159
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	1167.899095621089
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	1034.7795338108651
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	1479.845566342033
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	2318.119178634896
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	1646.0507734959358
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	2059.2503715038115
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	1432.5313895178501
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	1411.1042071521765
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	802.8528578900306
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	1421.6795401249499
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	1751.9345741161592
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	1423.2752070165748
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	1310.5805013385532
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	1384.478606812478
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	993.7704373769648
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	1491.4702233381765
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	2834.8506415258857
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	1509.1579587549384
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	1261.8525354316187
He conjured up the scene before them.	475.07141447291525
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	681.3811200993229
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	1178.2223957875037
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	689.1071181254391
Yes, it is true.	164.22594289862633
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	680.260353463276
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	1045.3216224264243
This is the appearance is on me.	259.8991732812924
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	799.9480795525493
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	208.405698573468
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	726.3367272087416
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	789.4494057203159
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	1324.4407121090971
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	1168.7236345499934
He was gone.	144.65567672714684
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	723.6181076087773
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	1644.2538646137386
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	1222.1052929801283
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	944.039067820547
The mystery was unveiled.	585.2929883616971
Haines was the third brother.	340.6471403480829
His real name was Childs.	667.1690839040922
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	455.341588052987
He drank drugs to obliterate.	904.6750066066008
For this relief much thanks.	986.7021507101709
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	849.0199008470325
No soul will live there.	518.5024549210528
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	1189.7693233174912
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	1120.268280608362
A curse is on it.	223.14369636636704
It is haunted.	436.35587019289324
Murderer ’ s ground.	370.83359750176334
What is the age of the soul of man?	206.08649887933382
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	877.3703676362322
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	1062.5114163390624
A score of years are blown away.	711.9371392267373
He is young Leopold.	245.75134191118494
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	597.6760886593538
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	760.4238072530183
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	815.083367856186
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	1132.4763613846594
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	620.0599656230893
Who can say?	435.2914539493584
The wise father knows his own child.	702.7657016694822
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	626.7770877536342
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	847.4829909567086
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	730.2888519473311
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	802.6980315982531
Did heart leap to heart?	952.1890906861298
Nay, fair reader.	761.8178232489031
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	1131.2012926393522
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	270.94634867636796
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	1013.5301944465211
No, Leopold.	134.25468105890891
Name and memory solace thee not.	1312.2869762006997
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	1044.201000778502
No son of thy loins is by thee.	712.1280547280675
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	449.6900199423122
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	1209.5036476386176
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	2750.5342980025353
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	1242.6180046245413
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	2496.916628240554
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	707.69115207077
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	796.5309372706175
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	240.40663332341938
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	631.2712583856613
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	2527.297998719835
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	1256.9502824046795
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	1428.3431327232543
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	1520.6517520639864
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	999.584422425048
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	500.8183506615435
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	280.2938664054027
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	1110.5254445765192
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	1380.1368442758385
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	707.342320265148
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	878.0387895195576
Where were they now?	370.1291762497226
Neither knew.	533.1004095250092
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	345.12218084052824
Why think of them?	283.8206110367875
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	1036.4454181167355
Who supposes it?	713.5153049982157
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	899.5127123062947
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	1191.6754767558361
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	966.8702915376809
All who wish you well hope this for you.	528.531465777159
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	931.567667209522
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	896.144628088377
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	411.00567633365955
Have no fear.	439.1683244890426
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	659.2593309180455
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	432.05978775447136
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	535.3568398118166
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	754.8672875931776
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	894.5627695103346
He told them of the race.	185.56244417395564
Madden up.	192.44569829705105
She was leading the field.	330.3134842796457
All hearts were beating.	838.5896292191072
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	1857.8433755177734
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	1233.320381598113
All was lost now.	271.00142875920824
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	1073.3046964544017
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	486.9594314748819
A tear fell: one only.	478.5231603424282
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	712.6630907251022
Lane.	238.63253457126893
Four winners yesterday and three today.	1332.7718752500093
What rider is like him?	504.0902039280206
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	1045.4885103274512
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	583.3942304518475
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	719.1289562022204
She is not the filly that she was.	247.74152148316549
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	604.543132142887
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	315.12733547907567
Do you remember her, Vincent?	442.8633917209923
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	626.3785007890958
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	731.7901820246246
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	1359.1288727870774
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	1634.0233667148516
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	1001.475737705842
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	1410.5763613187496
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	472.52828921389255
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	648.1949856061774
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	1365.1425243031313
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	1116.2814804575978
But he had been kind.	283.18926829936737
In going by he had blessed us.	394.5279886920544
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	471.2834565849145
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	1198.0999776702154
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	688.5124779065055
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	1468.3529721160091
His soul is far away.	456.5355309066596
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	662.6878793876076
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	1049.7991810896337
Do you not think it, Stephen?	270.38709536743113
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	1584.488656175186
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	1979.8680812061605
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	800.8310124016418
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	2297.294652855606
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	1750.4302166452258
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	1175.1596138233951
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	764.8949643392534
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	875.3296384838098
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	2084.888573907261
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	710.568703196283
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	1313.5499978396547
A gallant scene in truth it made.	651.3407269681768
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	877.3695415805762
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	1313.0528404591957
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	970.0205644242932
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	2433.406567607966
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	1666.2593772433675
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	738.965079706754
Dedalus ’ (Div.	321.11045419850365
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	4204.758870773891
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	741.0486460478463
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	958.7456791898151
Bloom (Pubb.	321.07456152897123
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	970.1844095354622
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	1494.875061290963
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	1032.811457329597
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	2074.1164999658936
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	726.4460876746039
Mr M.	141.65524244906084
Mulligan (Hyg.	465.9315716697245
et Eug.	992.211662986586
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	3818.247198214755
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	1129.3170801241197
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	1798.4642135045567
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	1917.0087747772197
Mr J.	124.98608529805058
Crotthers (Disc.	865.7028973156825
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	1564.7350238172735
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	1606.8069445172348
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	1139.1208406606577
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	1316.6662226851272
Lynch (Bacc.	572.1763228826162
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	1255.9602741650342
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	1509.4528982338752
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	1517.0129932889304
Mr S.	139.38802701017605
Dedalus ’ (Div.	321.11045419850365
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	2706.107391158089
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	2792.9875598243134
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	1021.5338071622946
Bloom (Pubb.	321.07456152897123
Canv.) which took place in the commons ’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	509.51946753471685

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	749.8438389937459
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	1212.7513753477501
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	1319.2901239053772
She had.	106.2676140014909
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	604.5620919364021
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	724.9772810593097
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	875.7514715671784
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	898.3276473721695
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	988.8160220700345
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	781.4817505160172
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	1277.094528358079
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	2221.7808962136055
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	1516.036280441848
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	906.3205636945087
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	893.415146644567
He knows and will call in His own good time.	427.82600515556777
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	792.5300278379979
Sir, to you my hand.	186.57930304233946
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	1060.2365346511256
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	894.87900477823
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	1054.9376211152871
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	830.8333681200553
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	1008.6516789098004
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	901.2566108428219
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	1442.1535960462547
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	1475.4349017221834
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	1687.0382393904783
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	1580.4267203162842
Mark this farther and remember.	658.4333149373067
The end comes suddenly.	538.837614270441
Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.	1425.2458930099087
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	479.1319873594598
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	1102.6196679995146
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	1816.4128055391864

A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	1436.6407588602103
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	1148.6039388242941
But how to get there was the rub.	342.2544431979081
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	2289.5577358114406
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	1325.3059651266217
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	1260.8691779477233
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	648.1241298560883
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	976.5177184060944
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	1305.020238907565
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	1855.9484196550252
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	1460.6644119444175
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	1206.4137410462479
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	521.1481008474276
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	1221.2547358241088
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	1049.9992036174822
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	829.6735754465705
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	870.0646315822133
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	2097.0559222934917
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	831.9163146195887
s.	33.43487766189757
d.	92.80684598616067
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	1292.744272940198
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	1047.5043726254503
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	393.20036052184105
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	1760.7225757175393
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	980.6532338605267
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	936.6697464687347
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	757.985955723896
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	319.5113060905618
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	1263.3650538055438
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	2013.4517164780323
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	1755.2351084669592
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	1060.3370004456658
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	913.4778672391029
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	2101.069826214736
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	954.983740061215
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	1727.4270477925375
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	1057.748803129892
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	558.3444533993415
His friends had all deserted him.	604.2530180580259
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	819.290746916148
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	322.53551016743165
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	682.4283253369109
Anyhow he was all in.	176.3965640268044
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	482.17894791748984
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	568.1510562929227
Try it.	189.75676003282683
You may mention my name.	618.636471067876
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	432.8552138337588
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	407.63616596722426
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	624.7559581536761
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	419.53022594569234
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	767.3573597759614
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	1115.949248341194
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	427.98015039713243
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	920.1221702758124
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	1736.9878421592637
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	496.59177140794884
Whereas.	266.9555776457352
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	791.0424317266521
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	832.4615628921001
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	816.3483296498233
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	1481.2658630710885
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	2012.3213992334279
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	749.1511721058336
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	753.9181634383727
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	731.6920879828793
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	307.48082276907496
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	368.93225275195925
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	337.99454392392613
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	295.39889195519805
Who ’ s that with you?	155.64321519572528
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	642.9614589350304
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	418.6700855750211
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	542.4427013315812
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	435.1390868922185
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	707.7265925781936
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	937.7551033636032
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	1134.9152759282385
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	1034.5420155284585
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	2472.045801790184
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	704.1791431890714
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	1003.0146897541704
Pretty thick that was certainly.	704.7618277435226
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	788.8659447339123
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	329.2310109918631
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	583.8368980010943
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	1305.5290257863699
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	428.95476833538964
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	483.0508192325225
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	444.2582295057904
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	649.1800608160567
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	1067.949036524979
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	1264.5089569908546
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	455.38356137351224
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	365.2332497526468
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	1168.1585771017042
Simply fag out there for nothing.	931.129289168778
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	748.3282673317924
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	479.3709196071222
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	837.0114463722254
Where does he live at present?	705.883027377159
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	344.5868172145012
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	463.9993790169136
Why?	203.35538390318914
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	623.8221939083645
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	489.17220953220453
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	969.5193942427919
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	1110.4271457513055
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	988.3050223576195
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	967.4758726284016
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	523.9743054189097
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	1071.9439854616114
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	1273.3838975030521
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	790.5639613065193
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	1378.9832056086566
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	1719.340951247789
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	2100.2334496972553
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	6630.525191374328
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	931.2644624749872
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	1127.5391942117733
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	3125.2256884309177
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	885.9442138387286
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	2022.8953216252582
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	2354.325509246947
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	895.6847532208443
I mean for singing purposes.	550.8600201860689
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	660.0053881932358
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	1288.3681777481806
_Belladonna.	362.3144614049264
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	893.2521783961383
They were haggling over money.	763.5380541032088
— Is that so?	237.96532305972113
Mr Bloom asked.	169.48270452529925
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	1286.4351898085517
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	1290.265067655142
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	644.0289832576279
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	1381.0795542382507
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	614.7893439837667
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	904.3587079984136
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	306.9663275860078
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	1302.4414940638308
What ’ s in a name?	144.7337098457326
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	444.1166760649101
Of course.	253.73610841956224
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	891.4116288943234
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	1141.439941919947
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	960.7521836211149
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	1576.6106405263702
— You know Simon Dedalus?	496.74990178010324
he asked at length.	290.3714680876542
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	178.42123072513996
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	544.2774556490897
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	548.7489163173582
All Irish.	207.9771981559427
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	403.6622059475486
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	947.1577175829694
The lefthand dead shot.	950.69089301051
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	1329.3466735960512
— Bottles out there, say.	294.8814903320003
Fifty yards measured.	2670.823774341409
Eggs on the bottles.	417.30048862095947
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	844.647906912709
Aims.	362.3144614049264
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	674.8694552784619
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	1283.9202688285843
— Pom! he then shouted once.	545.1494484413018
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	1961.878499219862
— Pom! he shouted twice.	588.9310625699587
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	1967.0874514018415
— Long ago?	544.4326528297598
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	1398.869496651839
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	812.0768233955191
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	1127.7087570037759
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	331.65780921013254
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	884.7739895782697
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	352.88546368979996
D.	140.90812251806926
B.	131.3245447289437
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	563.5425638083076
Know where that is?	404.96593631367074
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	665.3073796210772
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	2188.5373109669663
That ’ s where I hails from.	314.4521963844836
I belongs there.	248.95614605571038
That ’ s where I hails from.	314.4521963844836
My little woman ’ s down there.	282.5095993051331
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	175.39155156090956
_For England, home and beauty_.	843.99232636598
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	678.8577238260821
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	1346.634911706339
Across the world for a wife.	279.05981621414946
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	1972.5627019601425
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	990.4395126899442
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	1168.1343089756401
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	780.9789761700242
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	679.9128752036584
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	505.18141419732973
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	922.1079925721085
No chair for father.	368.3199429536122
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	1773.9707975167241
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	1098.9577407747827
Grin and bear it.	449.0007696034511
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	1242.413014380624
B.	131.3245447289437
Murphy.	194.13978749570623
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	640.9809700699547
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	856.5716354966747
— Thank you, the sailor said.	184.17770111521142
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	839.1569058690898
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	1848.3576223484927
I shipped to get over.	343.6310367550089
Paid off this afternoon.	1017.9230662669531
There ’ s my discharge.	272.110908706013
See?	263.53599557277175
D.	140.90812251806926
B.	131.3245447289437
Murphy.	194.13978749570623
A.	53.193264159879526
B.	131.3245447289437
S.	90.57861535123159
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	1533.6904123417612
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	519.7342959180845
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	702.4759916708732
I was in the Red Sea.	220.45377270810494
I was in China and North America and South America.	744.6398981068521
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	1381.583452055136
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	1126.5951940615882
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	854.0740903683284
I seen Russia.	486.6035604285464
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	1694.178082865129
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	497.57708800923785
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	533.1242606890703
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	716.6409785945096
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	869.0359159287416
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	1022.0343136994961
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	675.0396585909706
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	1119.4080060159886
Look here.	250.0889293904331
Here they are.	218.7009918399664
A friend of mine sent me.	421.94178274988946
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	861.8418436271745
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	1515.5780455956171
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	1632.4894616882143
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	1423.584126288642
Stomachs like breadgraters.	1343.094145841502
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	1197.5071011589919
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	1803.7985715706848
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	1380.918717982094
— Know how to keep them off?	573.420903061694
he inquired generally.	619.302108137509
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	1151.7496369829728
That boggles ’ em.	747.960055987868
Glass.	251.21481667538362
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	1490.3421066049807
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	1820.930479775913
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	1845.3315497262122
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	1870.2516792119086
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	900.6941512757552
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	1377.0256338071274
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	1904.416888876723
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	915.4301351066177
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	1978.437335087512
That was the rub.	216.5491565640816
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	1330.454812210664
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	1249.4431351103813
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	1521.7266206946495
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	1034.1123726003066
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	804.3409311282508
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	284.9910553301963
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	758.8103931858604
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	297.45642264838176
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	1180.2104958337907
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	1442.9019408943375
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	677.3303825808528
Knife in his back.	236.00691261532612
Knife like that.	271.3658332854178
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	1313.7257719052452
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	900.7859366751557
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	603.429165700407
Like that.	126.01486411951868
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	628.9384920382832
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	505.38769163813805
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	2323.867166585583
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	577.9894765704252
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	1484.5522427984383
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	462.7321476011081
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	1112.5437146324048
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	1330.8498144904452
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	884.0329224090506
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	1492.160765434352
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	813.1084716088345
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	1088.521307586058
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	305.3613609673495
Give us back them papers.	588.3306771294874
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	1024.78673706508
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	471.87243000153813
Mr Bloom inquired.	362.8840571191158
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	502.3588736358083
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	762.6774617155393
— What year would that be about?	347.5876787814368
Mr B interrogated.	630.4960344442707
Can you recall the boats?	862.1239464213699
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	1123.4006213883622
Salt junk all the time.	619.2393214084613
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	740.6717529614294
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	1075.0820894768863
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	1335.452139122543
And it left him wondering why.	513.0180439853862
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	564.1102995330788
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	725.569743455723
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	1131.100192623904
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	734.9974647567501
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	634.1377677502638
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	525.6432183095984
I hate roaming about.	562.6325744172535
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	623.3918183193148
— What age is he?	262.1077395232659
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	985.9016068205588
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	716.2563256947252
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	392.5295603425598
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	2002.911557320522
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	685.9947864239174
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	628.9922178912279
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	450.68742585891744
I hate those buggers.	620.458026852504
Suck your blood dry, they does.	813.7365630760502
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	917.0451819867508
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	633.0911865397729
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	2015.0812027321688
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	267.76393879658275
There he is himself, a Greek.	206.97925052526375
one asked the sailor.	207.47710574702128
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	678.7467879809917
Someway in his.	212.07404179849297
Squeezing or.	371.9339052313732
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	329.1534844719734
There he is cursing the mate.	502.2970587729535
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	482.7777672822892
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	1546.1276851172527
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	566.02687431019
He ’ s gone too.	166.48310207334737
Ate by sharks after.	1011.9694744793223
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	613.6577263573085
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	573.0393941889898
— And what ’ s the number for?	194.18096417628033
loafer number two queried.	1382.2563805764369
a third asked the sailor.	273.6244687505977
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	789.582780738692
Ate.	316.5108355747976
A Greek he was.	191.64201763217847
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	1334.0097371061074
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	659.1145412966384
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	724.9390271721926
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	1569.7135750513023
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	977.5855639401349
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	866.1688583928972
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	1131.1268882015975
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	276.0677264790085
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	1123.9606864339191
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	1612.1205146852922
Still no matter what the cause is from...	246.58799181414642
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	1105.579171105872
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	685.7587807591165
She is a bad merchant.	370.7673957195201
She buys dear and sells cheap.	1410.9461031604842
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	906.2349715425337
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	1304.6499382804402
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	329.88612453669896
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	567.3316310182141
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	727.7819602986668
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	1440.125617395945
Do you?	221.2798879874277
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	1044.1435660424781
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	1378.2220767485067
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	1473.056141942391
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	417.8632434834879
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	643.2799353096411
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	765.0831113357681
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	1372.995800477692
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	1311.9076677371318
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	605.8215010218009
I ’ m not so sure about that.	246.8723674091965
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	664.9724117425635
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	848.3549393426638
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	347.01389218258174
Let me stir it.	418.39271145377836
And take a piece of that bun.	380.8284162359223
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	569.3528326566574
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	667.5832326791941
Try a bit.	263.9874257091195
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	775.1338046141464
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	1481.0895357313818
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	1293.2350396450936
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	529.3881953949393
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	1418.2573036422457
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	1962.075403853473
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	525.7285795800341
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	1280.4408839278756
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	1149.9313241663904
You ought to eat more solid food.	971.0346081681096
You would feel a different man.	388.32652372568936
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	382.4004736231195
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	604.8320263057628
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	186.40183137839895
It reminds me of Roman history.	705.9555639833603
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	1324.847858811555
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	1530.4919899328634
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	1111.1906452606663
Look at him.	176.46619538168846
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	1215.33757722434
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	783.774513627934
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	1719.6883714991382
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	1264.7391718100607
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	2427.598461210786
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	1072.8233171372945
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	362.42942372023083
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	884.411988930244
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	633.2251142092432
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	1120.275256919279
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	518.5702778557173
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	1540.9536558061177
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	1529.2465961231476
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	1181.2378031035205
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	780.1414785596977
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	278.5768019275328
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	1350.073531761462
She has the Spanish type.	456.1840267009524
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	775.9620151907448
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	1138.6050511541407
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	511.5819660774545
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	668.9901185528015
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	7921.956427935019
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	436.3742150400707
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	1371.2511932803695
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	274.938359900727
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	288.51727656247334
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	878.2338831587833
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	797.6297529617041
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	732.4415829349466
An exception here and there.	479.2526214753466
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	551.6027832556803
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	677.4924458819328
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	524.0318068828142
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	805.0878673767925
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	436.0426224451876
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	666.2336649585944
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	1380.914918674633
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	1402.8551540869062
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	249.06197753091803
s.	33.43487766189757
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	1669.117295535752
No aid was given.	491.3047890957502
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	626.3157630132189
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	276.98366797961177
At this stage an incident happened.	1491.0468681068883
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	1363.9618389077748
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	1148.0572806464168
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	745.6817592627943
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	1013.8355824627907
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	1361.7147938547025
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	1630.1031086664098
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	2808.9154222462366
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	1609.9472066237572
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	1215.8407747461551
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	836.6560337971899
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	958.9682475446715
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	1301.9780733901641
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	1193.7127485713459
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	1412.8565935876677
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	963.8305480527686
— Am I right, skipper?	516.892514228262
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	567.9777554787917
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	1419.1812202046983
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	755.6272576989902
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	1399.5431260335945
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	1364.9886061049078
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	1023.2138466008082
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	1346.496607107897
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	1141.6750653664246
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	462.090033202998
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	310.7925414775735
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	1334.6435979191508
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	662.5628373190951
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	497.9477002585672
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	975.9752577060792
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	3419.455770940165
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	1424.4914358437431
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	1831.1632578745969
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	382.2330922815655
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	2468.9776171331882
And the best jumpers and racers?	861.8382977951952
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	977.3588385496246
Tell me that.	172.2953387337487
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	1071.6442122714593
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	380.34539815068774
The Irish catholic peasant.	875.2709820349677
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	298.58876113548183
You know Jem Mullins?	2023.528223615806
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	1414.6140360250354
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	1046.1145952075876
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	1433.362879863951
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	965.6140831223805
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	861.0051828667002
And now, why?	235.57495109140663
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	635.5581397000648
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	968.6774399391209
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	1562.7071915649522
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	1101.917451013325
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	950.1929002748955
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	827.5749936948146
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	2082.7273726630674
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	691.6300878147409
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	1703.6488698590845
s.	33.43487766189757
d.	92.80684598616067
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	672.4299828234253
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	990.838453086421
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	930.6739643543524
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	621.1730083755333
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	591.4231811304996
A soft answer turns away wrath.	1459.6567164213254
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	465.7147615854443
Am I not right?	446.7481996520933
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	803.71340316488
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	1234.389180527233
— Of course, Mr B.	295.83165760439346
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	589.7916546508826
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	1062.6197085539873
But with a little goodwill all round.	423.57370719767215
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	1157.2149280976134
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	1287.9909809536305
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	1249.0167574525005
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	1265.7778498676817
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	594.8403961120144
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	1607.1412173837475
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	309.04355672334424
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	237.38715125070223
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	887.2883968236965
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	991.1426447040274
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	776.1014060175662
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	803.0851001480302
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	1585.1738666116512
Why?	203.35538390318914
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	812.859687778011
They are practical and are proved to be so.	504.4774234856554
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	602.2331975352146
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	1012.7394941519487
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	682.5795284238761
Turks.	287.5691785887357
It ’ s in the dogma.	175.1846181211482
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	756.9736737152348
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	423.76823488689956
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	1233.3428098438465
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	820.5441230443677
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	355.0477887380266
I call that patriotism.	354.22085013216935
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	2144.4555381728997
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	358.8876279047982
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	976.5608406423598
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	1062.6197323031427
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	331.9309298662933
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	612.775375939574
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	1099.9732853311068
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	465.8863962031062
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	454.63594263857516
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	810.5082461495095
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	1540.5656516670388
That ’ s work too.	211.46757177520632
Important work.	733.2428623363552
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	706.0039289541087
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	891.9707174559973
What?	128.2987952047132
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	457.6792525252138
Each is equally important.	1336.6754835340603
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	963.354068717433
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	501.5724169473286
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	651.7276131853179
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	1013.2020772871168
Excuse me.	241.61765603464033
What was it you...?	72.77911606048782
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	990.1714705032019
Let us change the subject.	486.0553137555016
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	893.1413323517141
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	728.9987072052998
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	1513.968110232744
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	1030.821414948217
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	1307.1816142837502
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	1111.6931766712191
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	1486.1486121721364
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	1012.6445357729209
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	1247.1096258063305
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	709.0038092048904
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	692.5791450145347
With brains, sir.	291.4099496298552
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	914.477954944998
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	2618.215852272872
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	482.6222158477801
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	800.6728583379614
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	1057.334752992953
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	1450.047472997262

Really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford ’ s after all managing to.	942.781118564953

All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	1157.1750197512486
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	834.4946819185072
Something evidently riled them in his death.	849.8512220117289
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	1932.724573054055
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	2117.107457644535
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	1221.8030390370839
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	1156.755111905019

He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	976.8383812992203
Still as regards return.	761.4178909347582
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	794.17655015878
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	874.4429227417296
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	879.4258417786851
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	604.2303209445429
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	680.2886706822839
She put the first nail in his coffin.	394.3672106218978

She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	570.8223755045726
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	302.5613043842946
The husband was a captain or an officer.	544.566226638048
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	609.9522323997726
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	2436.0923397167485
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	1090.1606230880511
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	1562.928466347785
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	1092.2000775240083
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	694.3956645724127
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	1251.7969974129635
Poser.	362.3144614049264
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	1210.3758520293059
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	1369.4683213621602
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	737.2337703606057
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	698.1506788927769
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	659.0627017437308
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	966.2174187189515
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	399.470412133199
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	507.3046963801945
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	963.10770491411
— Was she?	276.8776540571257
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	1052.668965988767
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	400.12344046865275
So, Spain.	213.0519485855502
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	1057.6246243856156
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	552.2920167283135
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	1063.454040950685
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	714.1964286389452
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	1097.202421032779
Taken a few years since.	794.2239623722974
In or about ninety six.	685.0813465201867
Very like her then.	264.0280461481175
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	1427.3640051213868
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	667.5751289065422
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	620.1028259911084
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	927.9829515251977
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	369.3754985869469
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	1942.8821955503468
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	841.5899145276616
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	802.2657869835635
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	934.9877363784249
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	1167.1540081727394
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	819.025611083762
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	2095.6154999320233
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	990.8185823394199
Suppose she was gone when he?	443.82372046735577
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	1503.15175126616
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	631.8727628436301
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	523.7450589272421
And why not?	325.84197239021165
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	1782.415077965519
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	955.5047264228554
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	1268.608315722928
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	1465.2728125741419
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	1298.7586331045125
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	804.2854965607941
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	1206.2274934720372
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	1216.0013979134083
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	1172.6229982977022
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	1515.8635856839903
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	1106.64587674099
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	1692.8235492706792
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	948.3036835843138
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	971.9189845598011
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	332.0840303039524
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	1253.2385526083185
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	1700.6527121431186
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	744.3940892254903
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	2073.8034746485578
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	1332.0882098256595
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	517.678129940929
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	651.6544462769964
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	654.8355257970636
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	1201.0812500661834
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	936.0071059607334
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	1241.0175806672619
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	1781.9238442413025
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	1252.7209510971388
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	1199.539920109262
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	1227.0595060993078
Your god was a jew.	470.4912699900381
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	1735.327417782931
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	1438.5529707752728
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	959.8137012858616
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	406.33235018626016
Do you like cocoa?	616.8276631069233
Wait.	118.6143906508203
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	442.252653021883
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	1027.2954378330228
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	482.88176664970575
An opening was all was wanted.	451.13306674996414
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	603.5527994265664
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	1001.6322811562525
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	1252.307784391528
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	1871.4177896856295
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	898.5480281630597
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	1016.4101586894527
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	1081.5429572024188
— Are you bad in the eyes?	264.0744147395793
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	1063.4843031923651
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	1027.6372619956328
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	685.8288499876884
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	384.17328933903934
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	2116.5050563002906
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	1122.771766575099
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	465.9518391813432
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	1701.739208287969
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	458.56494046281307
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	353.9074860303017
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	1024.5444024834558
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	904.6326020575318
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	722.4584116947984
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	792.8190797268073
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	278.5121711524978
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	426.6878562458177
Come.	101.86261728670831
It ’ s not far.	182.71048894945653
Lean on me.	278.75641583312955
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	552.7271431002837
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	598.26494971717
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	1092.8007948644695
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	951.2394499555196
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	1123.4933948024386
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	854.3718710014139
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	1038.676862538237
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	1623.9898589298682
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	1152.0612961953268
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	755.015596312807
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	1334.2477767858031
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	683.7576790855185
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	1445.1056933988755
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	1451.768706873614
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	1647.8965516592223
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	809.4924623565157
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	1097.734695989915
Beware of the steamroller.	375.9990257784537
They thereupon stopped.	953.8222126264616
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	932.3162878542071
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	654.6480044889622
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	490.93516568311503
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	872.8742810256952
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	1269.2725562047222
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	1219.160644873813
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	1160.5620268628397
— What ’ s this I was saying?	231.67755255002774
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	1118.9675443570954
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	952.1317764046225
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	926.9778656559841
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	2663.8476384882747
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	2709.103229657333
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	2579.8449847124307
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	475.3689888757582
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	1772.433223965106
A.	53.193264159879526
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	1251.928421786997
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	926.6950036421279
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	1157.8203169724698
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	1460.4496349581113
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	2390.588643377691
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	870.2121364311963
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	1379.2755717490759
The horse was just then.	286.6130768438402
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	1359.0318755473418
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	1222.0609079281257
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	824.1570139797873
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	998.3521355997899
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	712.9906103470978
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	7404.298285928223
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	848.5369382328522
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	1116.3884312710122
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	1375.0892623733168
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	1530.6092139768987
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	1631.7637892013393
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	2233.672582177801
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	979.7278777614958
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	3051.90911550863
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	2273.3106213501155
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	1115.1760710818392
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	4655.183944640003
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	3642.7500964382316
Were their views on some points divergent?	1792.933242692223
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	1241.7242416015658
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	1364.671525661471
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	2005.7245051789757
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	1109.5558712859565
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	1465.6115436409345
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	2811.8412866426106
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	1683.0321118731724
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	1411.554433486037
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	2554.6071701097585
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	1301.1774758283982
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	548.6319338427227
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	668.9982404729152
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	1683.4223364725133
As in what ways?	475.024844936065
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	802.8635297074546
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	944.4267257190214
Was it there?	297.7257427460512
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	479.8322613891785
Why was he doubly irritated?	1148.562877452183
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	667.6885301174717
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	967.4544545336192
To enter or not to enter.	597.4642986916863
To knock or not to knock.	458.8307301039152
Bloom ’ s decision?	332.1650804781588
A stratagem.	401.82531000530776
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	1306.2194177221038
Did he fall?	437.92986379635903
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	1658.4812343128935
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	1972.9988558135315
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	2981.097237932784
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	1131.2728935810007
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	1183.2176681715273
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	1723.0136354893866
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	1347.3284282487425
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	419.1523496112045
Did Stephen obey his sign?	1008.9066255855116
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	837.1977246086682
What did Bloom do?	325.7879737006849
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	1808.3970303322517
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	1581.088183376432
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	871.2827332744242
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	619.7858951002182
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	3588.641145132323
What did Bloom see on the range?	395.2154246706094
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	1333.7798109889475
What did Bloom do at the range?	420.4247296219288
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	846.1586205941935
Yes.	79.54417819042295
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	2219.513230902392
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	1320.4508962877737
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	597.0692342612624
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	2720.5311557675577
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	1423.6369941705505
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	1826.81554971054
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	915.248659242102
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	1439.1392519830267
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	1496.310368169049
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	1224.3278006820824
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	4184.666006135964
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	1014.6548625485073
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	768.2394894429
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	1004.7825500305534
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	1012.9475648003948
The phenomenon of ebullition.	488.42845202385297
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	3287.9360879821074
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	1623.8321342435947
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	1056.5536604511872
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	2211.821283569384
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	1405.8580557421512
To shave himself.	540.2419971373604
What advantages attended shaving by night?	1951.749377235187
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	2150.64350312731
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	1474.9820539498317
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	1142.8394211736484
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	1032.2462225495942
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	1537.4691308407184
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	883.7642244128983

On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	1478.3397960449424
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	790.7712985202968
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	2087.460106690787
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	2666.2490356770913
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	1150.697313630645
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	949.8437365842738

W.	143.78458929436798
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	1052.3884528859667
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	1029.5994567841767
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	3727.200980709354
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	3147.176102266691
His mood?	681.399785600325
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	467.2376563872387
What satisfied him?	453.87813401633235
To have sustained no positive loss.	1492.5978966247098
Light to the gentiles.	338.7304193032473
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	1104.5869992943879
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	1314.850522715395
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	1751.2618170404648
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	1086.2964985493722
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	1134.7007870418172
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	1198.7851932755234
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	1619.4035799162073
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	551.840083653194
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	510.6845150709019
Who drank more quickly?	958.3578775341211
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	728.6361456006006
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	2625.411109776958
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	1730.7092590599223
Had he found their solution?	913.4422711203306
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	1349.2826865248246
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	863.8750441024099

Dearer far than song or wine.	1392.1557026177493
You are mine.	283.5191079943598
The world is mine.	277.9736328757313
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	1308.0162546961003
G.	199.38933213025123
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	1041.757889651473

How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	5440.1011412331345
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	505.63965615048454

Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	974.5872604623338
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	1447.6031208950928
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	2434.3166964351494
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	1016.513575463374
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	1318.5157259491416
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	1705.3253295065426
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	1808.9792046209147
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	2009.0005092393612
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	2212.5475167374298
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	1935.1728572505103
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	2455.7514116640414
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	3680.9547983584253

Did they find their educational careers similar?	2345.3100790859244
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame ’ s school and the high school.	977.1323207040471

Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	1034.694021505948
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	694.6575998543243
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	2247.827487218153
The scientific.	293.5798015336128
The artistic.	255.25053461625944
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	1527.1578542789227
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	1663.2531174083424
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	4339.126887474924
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	1752.570268826207
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	5910.02829771064
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	894.4644738186001
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	2374.0290948800925
James, the former by his <NUM> d bazaar at <NUM> George ’ s street, south, the latter at his <NUM> / <NUM> d shop and world ’ s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at <NUM> Henry street, admission <NUM> d, children <NUM> d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.	1433.0273991001716

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?	2379.059787950586
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.	1474.7315798268537
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?	1068.541596297697
Solitary hotel in mountain pass.	1165.8010754815016

What?	128.2987952047132
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel.	762.4867492696523
Queen ’ s Ho...	157.73627983735133
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	1104.7501423166204
The Queen ’ s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the <NUM> June <NUM>, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of <NUM> parts of aconite liniment to <NUM> of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at <URL> <URL>. on the morning of <NUM> June <NUM> at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, <NUM> Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at <URL> <URL>. on the afternoon of <NUM> June <NUM> a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, <NUM> Main street, Ennis.	961.9945861689596
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	2562.410883614955
Coincidence.	251.21481667538362
He preferred himself to see another ’ s face and listen to another ’ s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	1231.2443282861752
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	1389.0478473275189
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	2655.5488675621996
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise <URL> <URL>., sunset <URL> <URL>. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	1108.3625509553049
What to do with our wives.	325.5352788745459
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	2016.2181342898225
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	3619.282773100075
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	1473.4558531638445
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	1649.9058432672355
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	1119.8959984048001
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	1039.637197464575
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	2120.0473999113933
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	2628.29071763434
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	2724.8180475530385
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	1308.0855456772356
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	1764.987135323161
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	1567.3321065079126
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	1627.449941624164
Variously.	362.3144614049264
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other ’ s ignorant lapse.	1417.2608459706755
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	2058.097723299566
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	1079.4195076112974
What system had proved more effective?	1810.4913988652934
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	5798.916962812976
Example?	775.6872792440565
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	897.773028436909
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest ’ s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	2258.987482786815
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	1370.9852634791728
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	881.2060939604876
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	1110.5793887889538

By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	1546.6165849227061
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m ’ baad l ’ zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	2145.1532389926642
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	1656.2578713681164
By juxtaposition.	667.4934907462219
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, and <NUM>.	1208.8208065637168
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	1031.3345489932171
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	3343.780611460272
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	1621.9046897775147
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar <NUM> years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	1934.2010339368917
Mary ’ s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve ’ s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	1706.362033259575
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	4531.6522976526885
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	950.0655975106049
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	1574.5805033418874
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	946.6902795484017
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	2706.122343734234
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	2883.85905729675
Did the guest comply with his host ’ s request?	807.8579018776445
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	1098.114423727669
What was Stephen ’ s auditive sensation?	647.3297129377851
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	1038.1678521845588
What was Bloom ’ s visual sensation?	575.8517497182352
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	741.2395178706812
What were Stephen ’ s and Bloom ’ s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	1113.4910729648573
Visually, Stephen ’ s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	2299.720865805975
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	743.1177757349942
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.	816.5356140567877

C.	105.94139119590463
On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († <NUM>), exponent of Shakespeare.	1559.5484729155266
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	1818.4022424110956
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	2349.115595667624
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	1091.6714563119435
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	1218.716822493015
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	1060.3146968575945
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew ’ s windows all.	892.8738021300207
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	880.617352197188
With unmixed feeling.	1078.047453694059
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	607.5551950774237
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	613.6705827081452
Then out there came the jew ’ s daughter And she all dressed in green.	471.2039236286783
“ Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again. ” I can ’ t come back and I won ’ t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	787.6645942324664
For if my master he did hear He ’ d make it a sorry ball. ” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	989.6551208931719
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	573.8182027925405
And now he ’ ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	596.6002062370059
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	982.4007090773381
With mixed feelings.	853.5343082818817
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew ’ s daughter, all dressed in green.	441.87843748225
Condense Stephen ’ s commentary.	681.0456885190787
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	245.94065127371408
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	1796.8486118544154
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	785.139855955223
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	774.3088248307339
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	991.4275468118685
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	525.3529266733777
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	647.2643625243419
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	530.6782875049024
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	862.6838070439533
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	1309.811578726293
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	1509.745667309295
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	1330.4139616812702
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	997.2713439138166
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	2078.22700031604
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	1038.4450005237557
What other infantile memories had he of her?	605.5571621259071
<NUM> June <NUM>.	267.6827813033517
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	3627.213519210314
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	1620.27677775131
What endemic characteristics were present?	2307.1973460488857
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	2079.6288342029898
What memories had he of her adolescence?	607.6364307717934
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	1149.3116922169052
On the duke ’ s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	1177.3178690573404
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	1343.3075342624327
On the vigil of the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).	1104.400511195916
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	1079.44153827306
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	897.8933586843193
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	1692.1093267249094
A temporary departure of his cat.	585.7604684673115
Why similarly, why differently?	1227.2895668015049
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	699.2842429454914
In other respects were their differences similar?	1736.1904380210756
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	484.0438798899643
As?	233.841926996854
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	1370.8430243745336
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	1867.688303571887
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	1247.961073726787
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	608.9450688225719
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	845.0125181342953
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	1591.176980860462
In what manners did she reciprocate?	1277.7170894134797
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	1588.5086878502207
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	1337.798147179575
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	1094.7014255044169
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	661.3469459934433
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	1576.1947390996154
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	1621.1730650503343
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	857.3916433265472
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	1690.0350969401525
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	2313.9411849152016
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	494.47534458546613
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	2104.9069684135548
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, <NUM> October <NUM>.	2163.4205716518186
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?	2888.2042725159854
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), <NUM> June <NUM>, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	757.8070213489569
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	1219.8832697760595
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	940.2635863672787
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	1100.6907444948188
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ <NUM> <NUM>), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	723.136284635924
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	1760.6152879801791
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	913.4999690408188
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	736.1665360288501
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, <NUM> Lower Abbey street (W.	1541.0105362589743
and E.	113.83680705334325
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	976.010468211601
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	2793.8230768431204
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	908.7086074787619
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	744.8888967935212
and T.	120.12630736747614
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	1286.176496955268
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	436.8447423764331
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	582.1753504834063
Never.	132.3836593760326
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	1244.166933461515
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	2068.3397052027217
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	2002.2832051036692
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	2435.633984611441
Why did he desist from speculation?	1295.0120258397856
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	1166.3956322775912
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	1140.242020641949
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	1473.9605011485212
Not verbally.	567.3711867723982
Substantially.	362.3144614049264
What comforted his misapprehension?	1306.152855410797
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	876.3197718819993
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	964.3290509242204
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	5949.799392013369
What did each do at the door of egress?	502.4757303329641
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	340.71473278283855
Stephen put the hat on his head.	209.33050955679505
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	645.5175550248687
For a cat.	223.05334238042082
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	697.5691072049094
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	2332.64812538068
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	1604.8738608602034
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	2113.8002355187105
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	4395.057946853295
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	2263.4568861606917
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	1627.5147533629415
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	772.6763671157034
Of a different order of difficulty.	585.2709276815871
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	2641.798928900925
And the problem of possible redemption?	687.3526379197459
The minor was proved by the major.	590.8603535589582
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	1186.0874991840003
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	2041.1656240014238
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	1224.040137132294
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	986.42701315624
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	425.8565939059836
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	1665.2837857524155
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	843.8942139710997
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	1519.947603883242
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	2532.4223733332037
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	1316.06337318478
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	981.4387313401535
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	1705.0433894576888
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	806.26313904513
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	1494.6306671807952
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	1026.3674857198084
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	2102.2246663299993
Both then were silent?	831.3762739280901
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	1312.6320429643372
Were they indefinitely inactive?	2927.899472427297
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	953.4700419068923
Similarly?	775.6872792440565
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	1435.8736833994328
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	2048.8080159653523
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	949.8291323214552
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	1834.0799124341895
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	1743.2568059699315
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	2173.672361692812
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	2837.1348557058573
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	2118.321043588196
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	367.6743932115218
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	1227.8661919362823
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	1133.8377903094465
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	333.83557625043125
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	736.7061105805259
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	954.9515838448896
Turma circumdet.	1287.2969652097265
Iubilantium te virginum.	2245.4070998740754
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	657.6588716196334
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	672.094271988773
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	520.6921376733757
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	514.866745110245
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	966.0602972637419
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	532.9564917795706
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	2481.100874658711
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	1999.6356777582375
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	2593.596215530205
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	2057.2219808973264
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	1141.4883615778551
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	893.9310799173845
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	938.0254349119159
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	687.273327631855
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	1082.6130515803677
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	1618.0651561284146
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	1070.1425941096259
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	971.2989040075877
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	1380.5208292969048
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	2213.769410684256
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	832.9818039954692
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	1890.737087540597
Describe them.	360.4113805923223
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	2108.7893692178886
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	1860.229978928308
What significances attached to these two chairs?	1754.2310103871534
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	855.7124112772229
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	1399.709516991106
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies ’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	2089.8579060989177
Clifton Bingham, composed by J.	1242.8277323366926
L.	148.5809057155056
Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications _ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_, close.	2062.988784746942
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	2400.903355863361
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	1964.226641177608
His next proceeding?	1192.2603478006017
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	1405.3847217404302
What followed this operation?	1080.4202669625145

Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	1152.8362248959338

The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	1921.6529947921292
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	1120.8344321934526

Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	1786.1551206255133
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	1960.8106161986404

What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	1449.6773829406216

With which attendant indignities?	1753.983281349415
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	2048.4438641573506

Bloom ’ s acts?	302.58516580738217
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	779.9353804160736
How?	187.76888629280143
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	1101.9030569451018
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	981.789847692246
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	777.637190356164
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	669.72833008962
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	1175.0584568843394
What preceding series?	1161.290806549854
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	1773.9254256281642
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	462.8327442346163
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	1080.7707717882197
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	1993.807542071972
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	1432.9360758548826
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	3457.3168160309647
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	784.5132250085358
Envy?	677.625253892059
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	3209.2249989467605
Jealousy?	775.6872792440565
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	973.9470020126423
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	1961.6244206557326
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	885.3955612403929
Abnegation?	775.6872792440565
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	2792.0495693795856
Equanimity?	775.6872792440565
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	1363.4434061327204
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	877.9020084997813
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	1929.9577865527729
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	2648.051952759424
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	967.9619567486825
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	2740.4961619088863
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	2368.3709863243425
What retribution, if any?	509.0241178258561
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	653.9608217200188
Duel by combat, no.	585.659173457958
Divorce, not now.	277.9426788353247
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	2839.4363333168144
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	2144.656604620294
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	1130.153429994559
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	1624.8267871511966
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	1122.098035848517
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	2457.4622674850416
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	2334.795837729664
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	1688.5751368730528
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	1220.0455293295765
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	2420.121734039204
Then?	186.02615107521285
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	3429.5326626943997
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	1220.0455293295765
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	2130.5563735289793
What followed this silent action?	1105.9195534661076
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.	4385.232373373439

Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?	2651.900548838835
Absolutely.	287.5691785887357

By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, <NUM> September <NUM>, there remained a period of <NUM> months and <NUM> day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	1434.4157768647258
How?	187.76888629280143

• Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with

somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that

damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used

wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb pots of mixed plum and

the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only <NUM> or <NUM> Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM> st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day

couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	1242.3687103494472
