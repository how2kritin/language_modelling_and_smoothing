832.999086943685
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	913.6254724893411
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	945.3906538618999
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	2325.630781518041
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	1065.4635449376717
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	1067.208300545627
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	651.8010389112167
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	982.6982320438151
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	1086.680129007174
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	519.7197905941448
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	773.8911701368619
Slow music, please.	633.7847795863036
Shut your eyes, gents.	529.7229805868956
One moment.	235.08405490512925
Silence, all.	158.59035207264643
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	1064.9039481154148
Chrysostomos.	327.7537808406544
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	1976.9273884922081
That will do nicely.	469.1171310783116
Switch off the current, will you?	541.6795253850064
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	915.92710456781
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	2260.1871477106597
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	966.6839816478731
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	261.7522466813485
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	807.2343576556098
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	840.4244848539373
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	408.39988677284697
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	797.5168452684816
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	548.500971159263
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	821.7593999994648
We must go to Athens.	613.9477154281262
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	836.7751909061675
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	493.14767821481837
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	1056.8862932931274
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	242.8410723288462
— Yes, my love?	195.5832950142678
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	1053.2088994293858
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	356.8646017378546
he said frankly.	203.7436055355796
A ponderous Saxon.	854.8884944049561
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	279.70240570099696
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	940.8042920353045
Because he comes from Oxford.	536.641844167965
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	367.17342119673276
He can ’ t make you out.	198.8246581775615
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	308.1188097817707
He shaved warily over his chin.	1003.0588742451675
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	397.21595971353236
Where is his guncase?	606.5718149483345
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	637.1385674589665
Were you in a funk?	458.96831468952894
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	317.72430785011414
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	632.2333572095288
I ’ m not a hero, however.	221.3503973796455
If he stays on here I am off.	409.2571888786941
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	756.2729498824257
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	1369.2810914641802
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	717.895291357291
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	679.5234687430474
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	875.2690355502922
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	1243.228700069498
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	756.784960282406
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	411.1736089018322
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	1198.9675486412016
— God! he said quietly.	205.20440942726736
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	732.6794928384602
The snotgreen sea.	516.368636502554
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	3866.6921339579603
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	324.1138375406517
You must read them in the original.	299.71022628901255
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	1047.4994211431724
Come and look.	152.67229314900297
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	283.54602367017503
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	645.7868560176121
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	583.7283480281988
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	490.9715295873337
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	404.87957265644053
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	328.2745842983552
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	575.7694640412925
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	456.60410579298645
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	364.7603185869404
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	499.0593292140367
And you refused.	304.520321118085
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	1106.249194151906
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	1228.1638378700602
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	447.62516549174865
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	643.363622727516
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	1361.214542994347
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	414.75010053068115
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	966.5473869402208
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	1313.4369143776032
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	993.5257365098254
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	2757.4818745892885
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	969.9402275511416
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	308.7763691865055
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	447.1471777472238
How are the secondhand breeks?	1068.778628467225
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	475.1800639428777
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	1584.6923501997883
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	258.50799750139566
Secondleg they should be.	592.9136724166717
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	429.5290966605494
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	401.6508189981683
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	338.325706973471
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	596.4396931060766
— Thanks, Stephen said.	149.96437544815606
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	380.3302193683961
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	325.7548855229265
Etiquette is etiquette.	1061.451763159019
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	635.8426168464193
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	633.5271668553745
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	372.8842630180978
p.	154.75327256732697
i.	185.6778706854622
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	645.0104881717463
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	976.5734088464354
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	1254.3615130728042
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	2664.972119809982
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	642.4585380688034
Hair on end.	418.3161002555953
As he and others see me.	233.61972188238252
Who chose this face for me?	627.0360063155183
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	995.8645359666107
It asks me too.	405.42020303945714
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	350.4545869438769
It does her all right.	256.9053792930316
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	2151.6037527073886
Lead him not into temptation.	997.0468768139469
And her name is Ursula.	395.8829917920667
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	454.37057578157004
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	355.1399457054708
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	714.6875841720363
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	570.7232454361707
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	569.9715886538006
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	281.72365062963354
he said kindly.	187.8735905781702
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	479.2841824483445
Parried again.	560.2355083348442
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	390.3808794565984
The cold steel pen.	749.687521195381
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	880.7228631112374
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	354.7384847329712
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	1627.5762133097828
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	439.64893593150975
Hellenise it.	319.5232180404939
Cranly ’ s arm.	296.4670167009119
His arm.	206.22142295397484
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	492.7626078225128
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	224.84126204341052
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	535.447025413781
What have you up your nose against me?	430.66750259038304
Is it Haines?	365.7689443911825
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	1294.2093153246778
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	2017.8308206064448
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	1011.0232925900984
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	1095.009346710874
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	1302.329013012318
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	898.0587035664859
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	2289.7749898173265
To ourselves...	124.00677924305253
new paganism...	182.44468012318706
omphalos.	412.94388766377165
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	244.1871986485951
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	418.12931922131725
— Then what is it?	205.32334052127658
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	763.7702540440412
Cough it up.	291.64815236008656
I ’ m quite frank with you.	350.1872637905219
What have you against me now?	325.4942949727385
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	940.4595130707413
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	713.4322656453987
— Do you wish me to tell you?	354.72461370477606
he asked.	81.11898566253105
— Yes, what is it?	148.50613786525903
I don ’ t remember anything.	285.4053659594994
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	235.90370337057638
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	1392.2740882973271
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	438.6798936448581
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	508.86530975151635
Where?	182.8914914813631
I can ’ t remember anything.	268.87072299943236
I remember only ideas and sensations.	620.202274490404
Why?	184.539251337404
What happened in the name of God?	250.75632816738957
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	463.1742408316238
She asked you who was in your room.	280.97157370433706
— Yes?	150.01831352624413
Buck Mulligan said.	208.43015321528756
What did I say?	247.30431562996824
I forget.	119.3178942614785
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	806.4267675115049
— Did I say that?	224.57115325204964
he asked.	81.11898566253105
Well?	195.16053496590197
What harm is that?	309.5315857942182
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	795.967187829874
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	339.8185508937896
You saw only your mother die.	580.7345553523822
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	756.5540702704452
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	363.7193229093986
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	514.9927076599246
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	630.8557933590328
Why?	184.539251337404
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	283.9136123478888
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	2299.9765813250788
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	1874.3285797444598
Humour her till it ’ s over.	296.98415414622855
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	1127.9743525322453
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	362.0821480106241
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	433.8913798981779
He had spoken himself into boldness.	763.7514370495736
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	549.4804336718064
— Of what then?	310.7579680643649
Buck Mulligan asked.	302.5211920652978
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	265.68168580552873
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	666.763108065125
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	418.4538540326715
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	499.4480104939372
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	707.4198901232925
Sea and headland now grew dim.	1542.642041921857
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	577.9991787589229
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	558.6566850853858
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	284.04878120523665
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	272.8508693028798
What does it care about offences?	1017.1781544145371
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	1180.5394288681853
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	433.41745780682584
I ’ m inconsequent.	290.65321417049887
Give up the moody brooding.	906.2969983463041
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	1826.9297182278187
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	1707.7619692793767
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	1603.9401136569968
White breast of the dim sea.	584.1277619766082
The twining stresses, two by two.	590.3224574342523
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	1729.3514567628924
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	2499.148040627383
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	996.9301933166718
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	579.1917781445145
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	514.373988922119
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	493.42559500483367
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	765.3273184525941
She was crying in her wretched bed.	519.1929888774541
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	479.67448965194035
Where now?	269.9495949260126
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	2146.4444228568086
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	1063.4711641747786
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	1628.9727605456146
And no more turn aside and brood.	611.918619201097
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	539.0375878183929
Memories beset his brooding brain.	3541.3198943711595
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	803.3664919869325
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	1116.6494928645466
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	1504.1643777369168
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	1005.6226073416941
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	637.849241893993
On me alone.	292.2215880989736
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	662.4113333358736
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	814.1174805061677
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	1305.6063733591868
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	354.0904383683208
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	3603.6168898130472
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	788.5839823391431
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	526.7394309622018
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	595.680373424969
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	274.83662450362834
Breakfast is ready.	769.3186519124902
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	1146.1389321918036
It ’ s all right.	138.88739858229656
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	177.44578439218478
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	296.64460189495026
For my sake and for all our sakes.	587.2455915875348
His head disappeared and reappeared.	740.5400305274303
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	404.6446808647537
He says it ’ s very clever.	256.0756336304785
Touch him for a quid, will you?	314.942148494552
A guinea, I mean.	225.80372259288416
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	265.22044603507
— The school kip?	619.0177895532835
Buck Mulligan said.	208.43015321528756
How much?	316.60436805582987
Four quid?	941.2431334455091
Lend us one.	435.2862385844703
— If you want it, Stephen said.	175.08554759543142
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	1059.2652631358678
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	1225.6858943499897
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	2702.1493231505738
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	1090.3045223422305
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	762.1005883252661
Why should I bring it down?	470.4449831645821
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	760.7962320831552
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	620.8895849580097
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	683.5273042263739
I am another now and yet the same.	265.2066508826182
A server of a servant.	333.0088001735609
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	1481.0377658825387
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	1419.889576188891
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	365.25659978554205
Haines, open that door, will you?	250.97417404543262
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	458.31668996821236
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	790.8342767928475
— Have you the key?	302.75962718658116
a voice asked.	135.61130482407927
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	227.58636007520812
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	1265.8409791098027
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	308.2654206647325
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	834.9886531086833
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	621.8281847106689
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	636.3867073044838
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	198.07586126393142
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	638.8691313126444
Haines, come in.	119.30668201580507
The grub is ready.	580.1003958878924
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	645.3137924898272
Where ’ s the sugar?	228.28133283162626
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	246.5494953561131
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	568.3002081782817
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	724.0165245966496
— What sort of a kip is this?	374.649852280034
I told her to come after eight.	312.83839430296234
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	469.81638141115343
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	245.66340083284757
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	505.18443862257743
I want Sandycove milk.	513.0886230743424
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	355.4786336183394
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	508.94516890733127
Sit down.	285.8726623756953
Pour out the tea there.	404.2330027263103
The sugar is in the bag.	233.90606974497962
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	532.9730447519271
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	1871.8039330958425
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	331.7129548067706
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	287.7604381544519
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	820.556017088073
And when I makes water I makes water.	476.1333785324467
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	310.0186555832671
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	701.5473775597079
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	928.9842064237223
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	311.75715487274283
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	973.4069226743378
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	563.0003116273413
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	639.2897236869198
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	240.5639108068548
— Do you now?	240.70796068514696
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	301.7735861664778
Your reasons, pray?	762.8401144676094
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	319.24176036568866
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	910.78162048275
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	469.0258828692719
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	773.6527938778852
Do you think she was?	303.41632741215324
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	1310.2503163219992
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	560.4317804324867
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	843.0292701170741
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	245.31646604588755
Kinch, get the jug.	265.6986514272595
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	525.497194240417
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	169.75541856327175
Glory be to God.	294.05989111968023
— To whom?	345.7411631896546
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	211.9943760619629
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	484.7436799515633
— How much, sir?	238.9089792455708
asked the old woman.	151.3503095664671
— A quart, Stephen said.	199.81737732565293
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	942.7525477298652
Old shrunken paps.	2065.3517535423234
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	778.9124213642037
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	678.223666880653
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	394.5670162216448
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	1569.543313748328
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	1250.5657054134795
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	525.6028911208302
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	1610.4109457186742
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	1011.7671525053345
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	579.444031895618
— Taste it, sir, she said.	186.00045758481335
He drank at her bidding.	407.6263342611285
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	637.9269969115438
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	1660.49130942465
— Are you a medical student, sir?	418.465524614168
the old woman asked.	151.3503095664671
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	317.682228407831
— Look at that now, she said.	166.98417715147284
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	868.7435060306987
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	710.7684017046511
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	823.0598710542315
— Do you understand what he says?	361.4048202716214
Stephen asked her.	138.96505790186416
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	399.4445990123928
the old woman said to Haines.	168.27574845868463
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	680.9012912084295
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	206.77702959708046
Is there Gaelic on you?	486.8368310778771
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	154.36554067733184
Are you from the west, sir?	278.67210869179655
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	400.9437108013037
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	354.47007326307363
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	305.44010137608024
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	324.6995281438064
Wonderful entirely.	891.0778019892612
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	669.7332612537623
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	428.42347545044845
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	311.79395282653957
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	401.68435935706503
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	429.4801430321137
Stephen filled again the three cups.	569.1533606869943
— Bill, sir?	317.2119689061028
she said, halting.	230.87609972009082
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	1257.3835248318985
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	199.87329161647185
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	1289.0904668028375
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	344.379247951234
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	1312.8849079282063
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	542.166782210841
All I can give you I give.	279.17466272923537
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	539.9129576426662
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	349.2098812805371
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	264.98588506161894
Time enough.	348.96502596145075
Good morning, sir.	209.30646592939345
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	538.2979419933447
I ’ m stony.	258.94257592786687
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	904.665609469152
Today the bards must drink and junket.	1202.5996133620672
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	834.3720484735986
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	516.2107114969776
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	455.9345039584402
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	645.3083802020126
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	694.6033575998835
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	702.9565371237737
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	930.6647123441624
Speaking to me.	224.56369077128628
They wash and tub and scrub.	826.1517481989763
Agenbite of inwit.	518.0204334674277
Conscience.	327.7537808406544
Yet here ’ s a spot.	288.56295202842387
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	771.2628728019286
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	560.7285516538941
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	244.12138405239267
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	343.61430676996315
— Would I make any money by it?	435.81213904290536
Stephen asked.	127.73918192616229
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	360.01919306642634
He strolled out to the doorway.	256.4683467783104
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	699.4950955321934
— Well?	178.8805016287458
Stephen said.	80.1825864946592
The problem is to get money.	323.1003438699757
From whom?	529.2999109880645
From the milkwoman or from him.	344.05777916678267
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	200.57234553780955
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	785.7467785466296
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	189.81084609375154
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	671.1564287127885
— From me, Kinch, he said.	152.98256356185388
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	504.49453320148604
Damn all else they are good for.	455.2285370308764
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	389.81418279680247
To hell with them all.	251.2412675950964
Let us get out of the kip.	329.7940261780663
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	855.6959647195341
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	350.8764383159234
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	224.5572711744474
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	787.6693070616178
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	320.38919395378184
I want puce gloves and green boots.	801.6732781658392
Contradiction.	412.94388766377165
Do I contradict myself?	934.4562411905399
Very well then, I contradict myself.	568.8147822115527
Mercurial Malachi.	736.490789828655
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	959.7917178768155
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	294.88465153753174
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	228.4165141344944
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	413.6496218157972
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	338.65387267410284
Come out, Kinch.	202.05431968660878
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	369.6435055507152
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	1050.769414146964
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	521.7252211714377
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	506.78153732202765
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	577.7375143068377
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	158.86094954651549
He walked on.	132.05096565263065
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	1784.9162756614342
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	708.1616368650182
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	451.1394026257861
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	528.0182725170055
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	964.3635127990893
Martello you call it?	563.1452578863041
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	535.4457079334722
But ours is the _omphalos_.	543.5996795730358
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	359.79402121486856
Haines asked Stephen.	266.55844732881906
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	351.8261243811719
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	791.0694709321403
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	444.4284022658362
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	656.7418625286577
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	602.8596723254324
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	999.7365146064058
Is it some paradox?	730.9475254704624
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	452.5603227765993
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	751.6500986051919
It ’ s quite simple.	278.29714686941105
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	568.077737687835
— What?	121.21994813499828
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	301.4168585118717
He himself?	173.0123645399984
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	614.6132079708991
And it is rather long to tell.	268.92662341251656
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	444.5379578330723
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	559.5061203408226
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	790.3804538625319
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	848.4369665916025
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	865.2802882105725
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	1762.4023630038344
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	444.02868155637816
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	752.5044664605668
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	1135.8715272809247
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	528.0557625549438
The Father and the Son idea.	264.11602282649585
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	725.4204178059829
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	1106.252971275527
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	969.8575574980306
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	648.4456392815504
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	265.4588028814001
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	1262.8573777039724
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	536.7325534740938
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	787.1797452696256
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	698.5570773841756
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	1256.8712702735281
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	537.8627656888123
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	377.58585902348307
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	234.83369618302945
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	578.5533534133554
What did he call it?	260.22302019890174
Joseph the Joiner?	750.7292984694999
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	545.8778203130952
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	233.55913725922954
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	483.53948261159337
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	281.60976447603167
Haines asked.	211.16476618994298
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	300.7327887922366
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	712.509026571856
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	216.88901774348798
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	995.2435373975131
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	243.52257937609014
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	493.4924251002037
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	668.6342568778285
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	148.28712596849994
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	440.4061613644338
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	621.2945173888909
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	303.18325940985886
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	676.1038119479231
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	377.48891290815936
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	1351.9850029901827
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	872.6476312974842
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	339.4554383324459
He wants that key.	337.32182658798774
It is mine.	214.89721969485433
I paid the rent.	245.04007613411542
Now I eat his salt bread.	597.8574548701113
Give him the key too.	285.51212846746904
All.	74.54320619151414
He will ask for it.	200.7635116404394
That was in his eyes.	115.89355948962908
— After all, Haines began...	154.6843740296342
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	607.2669879482005
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	478.5105848601953
You are your own master, it seems to me.	338.52389937795715
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	360.84207268203096
— Italian?	266.0696516289834
Haines said.	132.54928420816665
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	525.8824999334057
Kneel down before me.	558.9300465332187
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	406.7492930948007
— Italian?	266.0696516289834
Haines said again.	212.35563476415928
What do you mean?	330.0448375067873
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	822.8081854451661
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	1599.2077332797867
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	304.28918558351063
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	572.1800610018239
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	1071.309182536157
It seems history is to blame.	643.1777962472712
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	2538.473603046367
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	1653.8957431028118
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	1274.6619912936405
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	796.1404868368229
Idle mockery.	1251.3304378412884
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	1005.585060001879
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	991.4185191499333
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	599.2089627988408
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	643.0242111923901
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	378.0500799726453
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	746.2134561659532
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	535.9697569557499
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	775.9373635443275
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	256.72624360279434
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	454.903720630274
It ’ s nine days today.	376.24386615312176
The man that was drowned.	227.74330455698066
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	1165.6232999582594
Here I am.	192.48236969178313
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	619.4349964537164
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	904.2690035298901
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	826.4243569364243
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	253.20881579127953
— Down in Westmeath.	428.6839769618315
With the Bannons.	328.8272322417133
— Still there?	240.06733845220643
I got a card from Bannon.	385.07385583155144
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	621.4691209182848
Photo girl he calls her.	554.0561575372827
— Snapshot, eh?	466.6677484016721
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	813.7774979555263
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	1051.8190372907839
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	786.4987732767845
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	564.8855012919281
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	272.4425627965717
— Going over next week to stew.	855.1447558819277
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	894.7748808679569
— Yes.	84.75158391348033
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	439.5283729659331
The father is rotto with money.	443.38786564220396
— Is she up the pole?	371.774328930663
— Better ask Seymour that.	520.5405924253726
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	703.0516711251651
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	1034.6168829366488
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	765.8958268709496
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	650.2629194757545
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	327.9705164772231
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	512.8605506156687
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	330.19644319780747
— Yes.	84.75158391348033
Make room in the bed.	293.18974763701146
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	911.55232380137
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	430.9286807904591
— Are you not coming in?	270.76590550582523
Buck Mulligan asked.	302.5211920652978
— Later on, Haines said.	261.30980980974914
Not on my breakfast.	303.04479882375256
Stephen turned away.	233.06734443166013
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	129.51162755761865
Stephen handed him the key.	303.77397535899553
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	986.4078034300067
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	189.91614675911953
Throw it there.	267.6973878655524
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	806.1839574994331
Dressing, undressing.	643.977328243231
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	663.0608785183119
Thus spake Zarathustra.	2862.1809851549974
His plump body plunged.	1085.4814346429525
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	465.2797738377343
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	369.65913012897255
Half twelve.	533.6916524477713
— Good, Stephen said.	124.33040400956118
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	748.4303893592498
Liliata rutilantium.	1164.494185797461
Turma circumdet.	1384.824771129642
Iubilantium te virginum.	2297.591634063759
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	1048.5724424737666
I will not sleep here tonight.	457.82658004050097
Home also I cannot go.	914.0768735255098
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	611.621670429952
It called again.	265.2287052165335
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	324.1752416318986
Usurper.	412.94388766377165
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	386.87121595698875
— Tarentum, sir.	260.3387434611603
— Very good.	219.20186584919952
Well?	195.16053496590197
— There was a battle, sir.	205.36393961533477
— Very good.	219.20186584919952
Where?	182.8914914813631
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	531.0294613570885
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	483.9582759231825
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	496.0785555783331
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	610.0858311097212
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	1022.9256843363876
What ’ s left us then?	270.358073922347
— I forget the place, sir.	155.76353028064813
<NUM> B.	166.63752867461815
C.	96.23846299732125
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	460.7075521305585
— Yes, sir.	108.77084343331529
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	802.3378585254128
A dull ease of the mind.	400.6498243026287
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	1200.8808150507796
Any general to any officers.	800.7043820092069
They lend ear.	618.6284943828258
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	173.76902028885263
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	283.7321039552442
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	432.0586009212562
— I know, sir.	101.82712462175732
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	333.5393593362952
— Wait.	114.72030131280994
You, Armstrong.	195.2799505910336
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	791.5474073614843
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	1401.1950801683145
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	1098.3783116888212
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	602.9738790609088
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	492.576464440192
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	743.2617592575559
Vico Road, Dalkey.	1405.6147275935657
— Pyrrhus, sir?	269.37344275233204
Pyrrhus, a pier.	264.9170327665122
All laughed.	240.18963041594503
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	3000.752987164857
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	1433.29489532494
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	889.2655730428421
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	303.12122393867435
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	299.84832253369416
A thing out in the water.	153.82200139414394
A kind of a bridge.	177.16163862093805
Kingstown pier, sir.	485.62765581502237
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	1110.596320232937
Two in the back bench whispered.	418.3137382147421
Yes.	72.08392493010007
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	1027.5688436787586
All.	74.54320619151414
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	1118.4670010333427
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	1082.5611017901076
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	346.5173299494342
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	299.4815128493214
The words troubled their gaze.	630.8024610838274
— How, sir?	167.17901756118408
Comyn asked.	450.23480485965695
A bridge is across a river.	433.7191006898603
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	464.5790890124532
No - one here to hear.	295.3112770711435
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	1286.268705014661
What then?	186.04734634938086
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	888.8392347100474
Why had they chosen all that part?	638.65343720797
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	1000.805980813981
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	782.5154357273137
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	1674.9636774839241
They are not to be thought away.	282.5817982270967
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	1101.4408139188065
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	739.5431294392092
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	547.3384972796565
Weave, weaver of the wind.	469.26976638352454
— Tell us a story, sir.	270.2978110220294
— O, do, sir.	101.03261400342424
A ghoststory.	328.5829183303205
— Where do you begin in this?	402.2882205834377
Stephen asked, opening another book.	431.67524450306496
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	478.2992037556848
— And the story, sir?	188.36686920117697
— After, Stephen said.	132.4849582509605
Go on, Talbot.	245.98765818213403
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	1205.6379294820124
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	913.7594458643111
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	1149.3931326372588
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	2067.1803374088468
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	1507.6352397242986
Thought is the thought of thought.	259.7236081932672
Tranquil brightness.	1218.8005344734222
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	265.70937949142876
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	1021.3429849709871
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	442.566883954252
I don ’ t see anything.	226.44261572175108
— What, sir?	138.07975563256483
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	802.1728731142877
His hand turned the page over.	333.51646100720933
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	453.5271843639526
Of him that walked the waves.	283.648955000252
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	855.482944255088
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	954.8893888333146
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	338.57869932162424
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	787.8992532073104
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	869.1400097601304
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	1171.5330897540596
— Have I heard all?	289.56035273453955
Stephen asked.	127.73918192616229
— Yes, sir.	108.77084343331529
Hockey at ten, sir.	405.12872604185344
— Half day, sir.	220.9764477377267
Thursday.	171.33589738740352
— Who can answer a riddle?	589.5043666399262
Stephen asked.	127.73918192616229
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	1987.5954387386173
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	1843.835150067917
— O, ask me, sir.	147.18477074502377
— A hard one, sir.	185.62413779778086
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	774.5086157792368
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	601.7370457022311
What is that?	138.25759076808907
— What, sir?	138.07975563256483
We didn ’ t hear.	303.5124460653498
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	1093.3722281828454
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	387.6025857502618
We give it up.	204.5491494441721
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	886.9607108749244
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	1030.860768716775
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	808.0672797374241
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	778.6212351031692
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	1701.9491032396943
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	2237.4980895080434
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	834.1087104537534
He held out his copybook.	359.27967998823124
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	804.1690346414864
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	1302.662750546239
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	823.568159705164
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	243.3744019630025
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	304.4871423164784
Futility.	412.94388766377165
— Do you understand how to do them now?	443.8371314123655
he asked.	81.11898566253105
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	928.1227224366594
— Can you do them yourself?	449.86004029824386
Stephen asked.	127.73918192616229
— No, sir.	104.28845735414895
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	910.5076093785906
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	438.11865019138065
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	1217.8401789557092
Was that then real?	514.0499698392563
The only true thing in life?	427.62944743225165
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	1957.8123486059312
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	781.0899591978614
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	1106.4710338590007
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	991.2855266580533
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	770.6497604953701
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	777.4803284986411
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	2631.263592474899
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	699.3404149765348
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	1238.4491317605505
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	766.5654162641422
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	1062.0019557060605
— Do you understand now?	406.90968650297435
Can you work the second for yourself?	517.4556704721338
— Yes, sir.	108.77084343331529
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	2870.056806121053
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	1454.9798191508373
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	2849.8198245381805
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	1483.4409161340004
My childhood bends beside me.	1101.4969678067498
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	520.3641425173947
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	473.73218984296443
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	1513.1627132005447
The sum was done.	340.66158392151175
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	290.2184340767161
— Yes, sir.	108.77084343331529
Thanks, Sargent answered.	496.5565737306451
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	819.2609604438785
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	440.4642267517213
— Yes, sir.	108.77084343331529
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	388.5888607403535
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	290.43121296802155
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	1397.875085743412
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	1775.5697328501744
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	1024.207110741308
He turned his angry white moustache.	603.2862980455247
he cried continually without listening.	934.4737402825871
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	335.60787841997706
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	535.4164493724153
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	657.3085001714712
What is it now?	191.42103020511055
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	1387.0766190025074
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	1707.9269888553952
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	379.35249723012475
As it was in the beginning, is now.	166.11320352301158
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	831.8343628237592
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	1248.4543523895848
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	655.3601479981501
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	1019.4837235605604
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	482.86460256232607
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	746.5891216215655
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	484.4789812827404
And now his strongroom for the gold.	345.8709049000872
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	1214.8729997759565
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	1075.3237230261857
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	474.774014391855
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	374.105740777266
These are handy things to have.	678.4705123589823
See.	112.09021633397305
This is for sovereigns.	400.69933446299
This is for shillings.	264.8226213324781
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	739.7356976083857
And here crowns.	375.0179415126419
See.	112.09021633397305
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	501.98250796621545
— Three twelve, he said.	199.38096685012493
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	216.9257811497264
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	415.70985141468026
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	281.95166680987785
You have earned it.	371.99880698091016
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	320.8663935288386
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	423.8323551573144
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	1113.9032158641892
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	286.28036887899134
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	419.79376063989054
You just buy one of these machines.	683.898998116451
You ’ ll find them very handy.	564.8754711724537
Answer something.	472.15750090225623
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	463.7963311326205
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	256.88949912639436
Three times now.	361.6562389522015
Three nooses round me here.	871.5531822418881
Well?	195.16053496590197
I can break them in this instant if I will.	404.7386619138095
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	410.51521383496714
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	409.7013180388716
When you have lived as long as I have.	350.8406135225634
I know, I know.	92.71457106879068
If youth but knew.	519.2272356676011
But what does Shakespeare say?	673.0908261750626
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	951.0857224272046
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	464.9209365635336
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	272.0109287922773
He made money.	204.71079019344793
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	369.62074623975025
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	351.5705655116564
The seas ’ ruler.	490.2807472489039
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	727.8712111794223
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	300.85857217806705
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	514.5732940670466
That ’ s not English.	196.38681013316804
A French Celt said that.	531.0357956223455
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	927.146346791771
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	418.8220673449385
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	601.9025002856221
_ — I paid my way.	200.05761734773776
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	619.905551840483
_I owe <URL> Can you?	1365.413013720537
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	808.3316105162218
Curran, ten guineas.	646.123179275046
McCann, one guinea.	514.3216892928256
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	900.7427955937636
Temple, two lunches.	667.4649132958917
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	1083.379226028691
The lump I have is useless.	538.1454337051723
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	184.1853218670779
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	961.1171170788017
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	292.14821559799617
But one day you must feel it.	326.72188243392236
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	735.1066024727247
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	1444.2991621706176
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	668.7186686779451
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	539.9061330958014
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	219.3093459814523
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	1482.866460007772
You fenians forget some things.	1104.1086134315726
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	847.6103511315406
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	1734.7044157010516
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	958.6622874457896
The black north and true blue bible.	833.0350050332256
Croppies lie down.	908.8554778889248
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	1089.8190636752477
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	344.40622546091134
On the spindle side.	463.1411907433638
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	1126.4733822890212
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	427.2215130909969
— Alas, Stephen said.	198.0233460382436
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	1136.203852498214
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	549.179512718255
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	1075.4192414509455
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	3311.878159496093
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	354.4199608665301
Day!...	80.51185468066059
Day!...	80.51185468066059
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	1512.522065376764
Lal the ral the ra.	732.0371241401059
Lal the ral the raddy.	892.3632497113657
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	317.4842593331456
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	397.9891495739874
I have a letter here for the press.	222.6022860138455
Sit down a moment.	333.7987075772198
I have just to copy the end.	263.7110168273629
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	536.2639512781365
— Sit down.	247.03205113847287
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	636.3650522751966
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	1171.5556211215603
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	1596.2898471659346
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	1653.687186017481
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	1058.7810550418299
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	762.2294730776008
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	1499.2456771788857
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	907.8573320070208
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	1421.734681921145
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	1347.3933759830077
Again: a goal.	367.7245002954883
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	591.2438961007359
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	1431.0339134780488
Jousts.	327.7537808406544
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	2149.2247722061948
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	1323.0319842738961
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	269.115770091672
Stephen stood up.	188.0747232807041
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	345.1649741969521
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	266.5691745353301
Just look through it.	287.8622001654317
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	466.6910018150184
May I trespass on your valuable space.	1093.9827091499121
That doctrine of _laissez faire_ which so often in our history.	1509.7068830348142
Our cattle trade.	947.0834893973445
The way of all our old industries.	360.1611224348065

European conflagration.	1646.843470859384
The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture.	961.9697117157936
Pardoned a classical allusion.	1416.949172723451
Cassandra.	412.94388766377165
By a woman who was no better than she should be.	451.1387102372399
To come to the point at issue.	328.36112549139415
— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	343.29286774916426
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	372.92297102210205
Foot and mouth disease.	547.901264692052
Known as Koch ’ s preparation.	1211.5032105524306
Percentage of salted horses.	1254.4261619163253

Mr Henry Blackwood Price.	1239.8401426588475
Courteous offer a fair trial.	1814.4806795604875
Dictates of common sense.	863.659861662022
Allimportant question.	856.518350232876
In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.	422.8822066926976
Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	586.2917349470906
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	259.8365804443919
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	1020.4987387165615
And it can be cured.	335.32788674287275
It is cured.	307.5112769988198
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	1563.1220047325442
They offer to come over here.	434.44341366348965
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	487.8241655176442
I am surrounded by difficulties, by...	246.36192003423946
intrigues by...	128.0124014209549
backstairs influence by...	254.3933005790019
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	883.8989521972809
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	224.7495588423123
England is in the hands of the jews.	186.62601076646123
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	496.58469934244283
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	333.7969750508501
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	1187.2487297412276
I have seen it coming these years.	389.32911667014986
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	1128.1193217303273
Old England is dying.	622.663473882938
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	775.0914784316594
He faced about and back again.	341.2921782720346
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	272.09362979175495
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	961.2790014154618
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	1200.6089902322933
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	610.9683869101499
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	483.38377431302456
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	270.72354452426544
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	402.79304839996985
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	1966.2473187697224
Gabble of geese.	645.314081323416
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	2400.331992545056
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	861.6620195283432
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	1383.7947869721493
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	1457.072005622213
Time surely would scatter all.	1211.2544419323274
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	1023.631356106061
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	566.6038536406036
— Who has not?	264.4497062309245
Stephen said.	80.1825864946592
— What do you mean?	291.3124845385386
Mr Deasy asked.	269.3677294056333
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	338.52388646476055
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	2080.1712543097838
Is this old wisdom?	777.871666572102
He waits to hear from me.	300.45653330858624
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	425.95867114504216
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	612.8284469796237
A whirring whistle: goal.	1100.6605926156087
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	630.520943512577
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	429.1549146428198
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	1125.1840588176196
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	471.85328221726024
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	972.7227885897187
Mr Deasy asked.	269.3677294056333
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	378.5954249966996
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	809.9844420673693
Looking up again he set them free.	563.2954869357673
— I am happier than you are, he said.	273.52897875642986
We have committed many errors and many sins.	1363.8348655971488
A woman brought sin into the world.	435.38866309234504
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	798.4277839732857
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	861.8956302593846
A woman too brought Parnell low.	730.1357658860426
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	965.7314655811858
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	361.33230117316987
But I will fight for the right till the end.	319.4399764793084
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	1222.4663274198087
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	268.6415156370856
— Well, sir, he began.	153.15535114899257
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	473.7235587957392
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	319.82746395931593
Perhaps I am wrong.	464.69767380893796
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	365.4059240319889
And here what will you learn more?	547.722202637878
Mr Deasy shook his head.	413.1817051252137
— Who knows?	317.62752922077647
he said.	50.91883309542916
To learn one must be humble.	865.0316509485929
But life is the great teacher.	443.18428105832663
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	537.5752579881236
— As regards these, he began.	394.48212903425764
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	178.15629981715307
You have two copies there.	513.5892484546406
If you can have them published at once.	577.9554844634266
_ Telegraph.	235.80538126221884
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	310.6662958480526
I know two editors slightly.	754.9568134241822
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	398.66673453865627
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	701.067299571
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	343.9928665836111
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	487.30041627148194
What are they?	212.49728017218686
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	263.0525560340396
There is no time to lose.	320.5682313120628
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	453.6525911384038
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	269.6267255681721
Thank you.	157.64509390952867
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	407.95688132255844
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	292.4162093512944
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	314.862440755698
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	650.6332861186992
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	1192.8200666689427
Still I will help him in his fight.	357.06855791748
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	889.3258772819995
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	432.9810181273929
No more letters, I hope.	282.94544334079535
— Just one moment.	262.3415363719191
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	212.74448389876162
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	842.6512610654187
— I just wanted to say, he said.	159.9006714534746
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	465.49244368746525
Do you know that?	246.4758705360076
No. And do you know why?	299.7542285247981
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	584.8153484912161
— Why, sir?	174.03542594156568
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	288.723610534962
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	436.7382463842395
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	490.81751193093874
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	579.2801752523698
That ’ s why.	145.10059438883826
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	1440.1211377091845
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	593.1195049944441
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	874.3764316710138
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	1782.3170581217983
Limits of the diaphane.	470.44241818489746
But he adds: in bodies.	421.2349755356339
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	549.5372897722735
How?	170.2852263135594
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	783.3899428441279
Go easy.	429.2440628200076
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	2354.5683898362613
Limit of the diaphane in.	357.9238779220335
Why in?	144.52418583682802
Diaphane, adiaphane.	682.1161391701471
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	417.9729589973095
Shut your eyes and see.	316.49157231852723
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	1263.5733833671075
You are walking through it howsomever.	713.4591004073903
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	768.2083770063342
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	397.3916923799781
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	522.9533539446697
Open your eyes.	365.37093585644624
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	898.609520510485
My ash sword hangs at my side.	1508.8880501688186
Tap with it: they do.	187.02814097982613
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	439.5063920514326
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	1791.7995842884936
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	2191.9758380045373
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	782.1824102211847
Wild sea money.	778.2243854400032
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	875.0809189650089
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	701.7434783268405
Rhythm begins, you see.	503.4662528329703
I hear.	90.46425673675043
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	2888.8883670129385
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	936.8046674227738
Open your eyes now.	422.0559565662855
I will.	71.85004074211733
One moment.	235.08405490512925
Has all vanished since?	1279.0913889425765
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	389.33346680274803
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	405.8579888436867
See now.	186.98782689995556
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	349.3978037045904
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	1503.070055099938
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	547.3787980484408
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	1018.0859142834619
From the liberties, out for the day.	209.96655856815917
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	1865.9910275608684
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	1284.7657699692343
Creation from nothing.	538.5558523816136
What has she in the bag?	255.66631461453423
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	1860.2893132061236
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	1066.3715118208936
That is why mystic monks.	1108.9210577798078
Will you be as gods?	514.8167312595954
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	755.28214377704
Hello.	131.45299260355975
Kinch here.	248.30306474537923
Put me on to Edenville.	453.85264068742947
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	482.8365919642626
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	2415.606670970567
She had no navel.	415.02518288960476
Gaze.	286.319300185858
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	1701.1021751005646
Womb of sin.	450.9629801539715
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	789.0883322710572
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	353.3961496606053
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	649.5285978121865
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	2603.6646182151303
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	1506.0432102766406
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	1779.6063251862952
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	895.4097321638184
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	1968.9338177773784
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	1870.1933252918777
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	2110.4562691874926

Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	1535.1132460177005
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	515.5986455716462
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	1399.618335314298

He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	838.5711441884731
Turn back.	309.6239850569316
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	1040.0644914454833
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	873.4257321203365
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	1372.8481766994005
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	1194.3531972293476
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	1111.005957318003
Who to clear it?	308.09110864228245
He has the key.	186.86890700238172
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	460.7646814724071
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	894.8114272484917
Call: no answer.	396.4236885783526
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	507.0206386460337
Take all, keep all.	223.13578444265784
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	471.3867608574663
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	1019.1876951776587
The flood is following me.	427.938781281604
I can watch it flow past from here.	501.69108221596537
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	516.672336676122
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	1147.6406152204972
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	1687.9197831292195
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	8105.119109860739
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	2174.692088550013
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	1040.9723018907932
Hide gold there.	556.0469723206539
Try it.	175.45035456230517
You have some.	166.7168839834904
Sands and stones.	543.6820640766679
Heavy of the past.	205.48465315481542
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	1069.828252737162
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	487.80215902414125
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	1085.4173514643717
Feefawfum.	412.94388766377165
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	4445.237558301941
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	895.6591659939666
Lord, is he going to attack me?	325.48866522414465
Respect his liberty.	721.563895646189
You will not be master of others or their slave.	553.35992365878
I have my stick.	199.55640468692727
Sit tight.	582.2470928987304
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	1024.6698567662968
The two maries.	456.7343872765301
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	1296.0408192851698
Peekaboo.	412.94388766377165
I see you.	83.64387360208771
No, the dog.	98.01482646232651
He is running back to them.	208.5304725755683
Who?	169.48198217090365
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	2328.3726122565113
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	2307.61267818723
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	2023.4213718175986
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	1901.1988050428674
Famine, plague and slaughters.	1046.5165191615138
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	535.4782024322529
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	717.3955929004878
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	278.1247154023339
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	521.7552778031358
Dog of my enemy.	506.66274397193354
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	650.3767593505954
_Terribilia meditans_.	2167.3678953985213
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	886.7917474465696
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	583.7006390649582
Pretenders: live their lives.	876.4643348212873
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	1135.1202188685904
All kings ’ sons.	535.9824196615317
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	560.9463384542374
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	837.6026735293085
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	1931.6880399156971
House of...	65.63869863584557
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	864.1559867916275
Would you do what he did?	374.17270232939586
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	506.3594914632212
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	283.29827528951915
Would you or would you not?	336.6218909017805
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	849.2606475603425
They are waiting for him now.	281.7473497475775
The truth, spit it out.	276.5657231020817
I would want to.	125.45033233729724
I would try.	181.0853683442393
I am not a strong swimmer.	506.43093903251025
Water cold soft.	976.8015541725878
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	462.5230603632824
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	332.72158316404096
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	1105.598985481187
If I had land under my feet.	418.052180395917
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	265.5065851023413
A drowning man.	329.5118999287429
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	485.0444764380247
I...	22.291638734365872
With him together down...	134.823156374097
I could not save her.	219.11891088594194
Waters: bitter death: lost.	926.2367805881823
A woman and a man.	122.00313512915376
I see her skirties.	330.11458199477136
Pinned up, I bet.	362.17757401392197
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	1228.8714924092558
Looking for something lost in a past life.	423.08570987283434
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	1280.638718324501
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	1020.3116275391228
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	956.9310264365681
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	1087.5146138746761
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	1127.1943556158994
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	1810.6155744567545
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	976.6553871535058
Cocklepickers.	412.94388766377165
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	589.345788650584
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	1368.382544854478
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	1016.5542323600713
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	1255.0578734815376
The carcass lay on his path.	548.1573500388613
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	879.9499907710808
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	694.326755746694
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	907.766853607979
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	1198.3759150504095
He slunk back in a curve.	492.2609406302235
Doesn ’ t see me.	269.21295924188314
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	1042.2828146707693
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	1377.0219141250425
The simple pleasures of the poor.	318.0324277254607
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	1863.743877795751
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	681.5547747072445
Wait.	107.93485186050891
Street of harlots.	495.4101364888926
Remember.	160.59846932519744
Haroun al Raschid.	3287.7825893513386
I am almosting it.	367.5123874658487
That man led me, spoke.	333.9054817164584
I was not afraid.	168.03211841472736
The melon he had he held against my face.	496.48231966912186
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	1479.9683668014484
That was the rule, said.	142.70183122182897
Red carpet spread.	1308.8898240417125
You will see who.	238.46828923816764
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	1332.2681860179541
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	2698.2631489266087
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	940.2319502001545
Spoils slung at her back.	779.7831792133953
About her windraw face hair trailed.	2166.5385430658503
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	1392.723528750582
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	2202.86387361831
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	1439.006286957677
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	2010.7514732487264
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	741.187145760775
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	2762.752812748578
Couch a hogshead with me then.	682.3876802347327
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	693.0985703560923
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	8094.186813875919
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	2239.918589886279
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	2929.3434655101837
Language no whit worse than his.	1436.6687366451154
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	3338.9879583875227
Passing now.	351.59350010473804
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	519.2665758578294
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	752.6245021523874
I am not.	117.03755095833732
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	1388.2250496364372
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	729.9346696064317
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	1030.4765215228633
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	423.17127184872794
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	945.7354291645343
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	683.3174498257403
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	6100.2813243294895
Here.	103.77932914467516
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	363.4710543633789
My tablets.	666.2360525889627
Mouth to her kiss.	310.29767817128266
No. Must be two of em.	285.76688992555023
Glue em well.	1392.6526377717432
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	304.33173794465193
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	1486.642911090973
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	1806.0719646984774
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	3279.1150717756072
Paper.	412.94388766377165
The banknotes, blast them.	481.9596241420461
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	336.2180509876352
Here.	103.77932914467516
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	510.64592539008567
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	627.6546189616238
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	584.4366632456682
Why not endless till the farthest star?	1905.7318824153663
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	861.3350560655399
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	1303.6895268856797
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	823.3204639932424
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	466.8349274798093
Who watches me here?	713.7998270912805
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	1610.9460612523553
Signs on a white field.	469.65235220695956
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	848.7620559131485
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	1274.387371022014
Hold hard.	386.3881843637711
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	286.45236735422134
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	413.56137643947795
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	880.853825172249
Click does the trick.	704.9036216915873
You find my words dark.	453.9199060274556
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	743.5702100261548
Flutier.	412.94388766377165
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	619.5243699722316
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	525.1261974606869
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	816.862614400481
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	1513.6045572252615
She, she, she.	74.72394832525053
What she?	157.6622288891527
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	971.8062578733312
Keen glance you gave her.	724.1952661756286
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	1581.5863598176534
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	685.0834367542432
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	828.3598233590814
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	2584.1374779193047
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	2149.273417066424
Where are your wits?	716.2905891728773
Touch me.	229.87851325634426
Soft eyes.	298.69938574939954
Soft soft soft hand.	846.0173232252293
I am lonely here.	346.5753808684909
O, touch me soon, now.	228.6245010872119
What is that word known to all men?	383.27128564047797
I am quiet here alone.	474.2995601860102
Sad too.	260.87934644017616
Touch, touch me.	279.31135490570733
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	848.9201386343558
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	826.6336911439482
_Et vidit Deus.	4095.6924942841842
Et erant valde bona_.	8043.762368357119
Alo! _Bonjour_.	1355.3368114497446
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	2928.064438876773
I am caught in this burning scene.	609.0720600843656
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	639.5879333886213
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	3191.3226507054997
Pain is far.	435.5124478212368
And no more turn aside and brood.	611.918619201097
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	1056.8707448465975
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	1844.7791710148374
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	709.7535500360004
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	960.2853946061292
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	1478.6905956470976
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	445.95092573259024
He now will leave me.	290.0956936954926
And the blame?	249.55601619556037
As I am.	187.40991656853117
As I am.	187.40991656853117
All or not at all.	173.58027668177513
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	1795.1740357748904
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	509.1549824861264
Better get this job over quick.	747.6065887978369
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	2030.63379546399
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	1883.5532592513205
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	1390.423010088571
And, spent, its speech ceases.	574.7008413244887
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	2881.3822198552543
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	3456.7070767231976
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	657.3212649478905
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	2514.9127558274167
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	1766.5173050147198
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	893.3913054459774
Five fathoms out there.	644.4165204626356
Full fathom five thy father lies.	2231.77996010209
At one, he said.	118.66470511733073
Found drowned.	1024.8850003480125
High water at Dublin bar.	664.0443954648548
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	1457.3844972855363
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	1903.6097319067999
There he is.	102.91199516818307
Hook it quick.	527.4671570774323
Pull.	260.138348246505
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	953.7964313393696
We have him.	137.2490948066657
Easy now.	418.1174919132643
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	3101.6073192421222
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	1351.0399527474306
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	6089.047172466347
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	2342.2167100523516
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	1728.1536397582784
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	1015.8309765218212
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	840.3204032153873
Old Father Ocean.	894.8407800460775
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	2564.8861220558497
Just you give it a fair trial.	522.9329221441789
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	2097.6762061141685
Come.	92.48991349408898
I thirst.	182.1281052245506
Clouding over.	481.3624185262862
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	736.0177244318855
Thunderstorm.	412.94388766377165
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	2034.900965250319
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	2239.1969879186604
Where?	182.8914914813631
To evening lands.	724.130159079273
Evening will find itself.	885.0554682511854
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	613.2953334272028
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	337.6882379455244
All days make their end.	498.5777217162471
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	560.2565163597831
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	1073.8868691581633
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	1240.3506060352881
_Già_.	327.7537808406544
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	406.7488184455706
_Già_.	327.7537808406544
My teeth are very bad.	593.0180156554991
Why, I wonder.	141.44851192874194
Feel.	175.62105889062306
That one is going too.	235.1710421609475
Shells.	412.94388766377165
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	330.477737926269
That one.	104.77211876743101
This.	106.07353399557181
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	672.5782384598544
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	378.72377936221494
My handkerchief.	304.22589072809734
He threw it.	164.16686364727622
I remember.	107.8158883211796
Did I not take it up?	306.4889914071444
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	953.9560676459001
No, I didn ’ t.	136.99254104300172
Better buy one.	403.3756124147852
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	997.131882711184
For the rest let look who will.	422.60187358465834
Behind.	227.25177915691472
Perhaps there is someone.	421.9234110874899
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	603.7982608154091
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	1368.9052012542188
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	1178.5889861427358
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	3383.245827422453
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	2330.5889881264493
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	1000.5350217923525
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	1056.6454094474286
Made him feel a bit peckish.	906.1936978644886
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	549.7617534262465
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	447.74485949600825
Right.	143.15965009292913
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	466.3781755065883
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	746.4749466470261
Cup of tea soon.	576.1487513771083
Good.	96.64799330511264
Mouth dry.	602.0122319965013
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	662.2022678194666
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	933.3150864035686
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	1198.059052883073
Prr.	327.7537808406544
Scratch my head.	480.1807763510546
Prr.	327.7537808406544
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	1037.133078487507
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	639.1473754315738
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	231.9270702371545
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	277.11824945369864
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	456.36361337267255
They call them stupid.	485.0197166527039
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	811.7679562914342
She understands all she wants to.	420.221944907196
Vindictive too.	485.55117487321615
Cruel.	260.138348246505
Her nature.	250.25496586674956
Curious mice never squeal.	2340.4517779907947
Seem to like it.	264.3831282410232
Wonder what I look like to her.	229.42524027945637
Height of a tower?	527.1858742792664
No, she can jump me.	304.91974364191736
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	361.5495971254092
Afraid of the chookchooks.	403.8156432622048
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	740.6407401167219
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	1295.26897368914
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	1520.5524998041144
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	779.8883572133182
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	535.4284134937004
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	1587.2665866251484
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	702.4379472337259
Why?	184.539251337404
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	311.305304702228
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	352.4535479374491
He listened to her licking lap.	661.3030370242913
Ham and eggs, no.	315.17907587363686
No good eggs with this drouth.	650.2326907404754
Want pure fresh water.	1043.1833995896006
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	671.5414867520528
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	587.79613365717
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	627.7202323877682
While the kettle is boiling.	633.3086182691546
Why are their tongues so rough?	1112.5142957715773
To lap better, all porous holes.	1194.66216485588
Nothing she can eat?	777.6849881024547
He glanced round him.	256.4296356039932
She might like something tasty.	622.0488220402382
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	667.5047531972664
Still perhaps: once in a way.	277.9820208723008
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	335.2328158225531
Be back in a minute.	310.90670130891806
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	510.52094311216666
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	906.8274888676174
Must get those settled really.	910.2973212047868
Pity.	191.6715737888812
All the way from Gibraltar.	247.1317722896536
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	970.9873717875564
Wonder what her father gave for it.	319.493668554394
Old style.	416.11481892186845
Ah yes! of course.	234.27467567809086
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	473.9992292846032
Got a short knock.	503.79448093300806
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	616.2360767541364
Yes, sir.	103.75279190799161
At Plevna that was.	347.7585301456915
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	224.26110788127463
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	597.8135573699542
Now that was farseeing.	444.12898491101816
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	1506.873046350757
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	2076.8264182643893
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	806.7422129018925
Course they do.	304.58849873889193
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	976.4549060924429
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	1323.8226800348796
White slip of paper.	508.4567438393894
Quite safe.	634.6699103084493
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	575.6400842028636
In the trousers I left off.	238.0702051570745
Must get it.	186.62084627185595
Potato I have.	264.70996237729673
Creaky wardrobe.	1822.5318937766035
No use disturbing her.	735.9630583339556
She turned over sleepily that time.	541.5947018482101
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	830.9625054285121
Looked shut.	707.6393386854727
All right till I come back anyhow.	514.6442237853634
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	965.6032228475375
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	540.5886101129848
Be a warm day I fancy.	485.97214078313493
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	880.2954511540001
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	492.9446429256857
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	361.6050645693948
Make a picnic of it.	251.49250293679424
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	1420.402819585082
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	4198.404738799468
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	828.7556471181769
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	425.59111638989066
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	999.3241630323422
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	708.7512469182841
Wander through awned streets.	3017.067029242447
Turbaned faces going by.	840.0701366681333
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	1626.2475314667581
Cries of sellers in the streets.	605.8025488954295
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	1859.8349520704305
Dander along all day.	649.8142223692821
Might meet a robber or two.	634.1726097186636
Well, meet him.	174.65154783427522
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	821.5982861850085
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	374.0501208491244
I pass on.	123.25959200113235
Fading gold sky.	1409.9484551434327
A mother watches me from her doorway.	544.2618286495325
She calls her children home in their dark language.	611.0650637456702
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	1892.2444947527163
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	575.4287752594191
Strings.	412.94388766377165
Listen.	180.3698566476659
I pass.	115.02395869212644
Probably not a bit like it really.	413.3003993632093
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	339.2488447468758
Sunburst on the titlepage.	592.8739196425911
He smiled, pleasing himself.	417.0485164442962
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	1091.7975915509674
He prolonged his pleased smile.	674.660965197442
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	1052.568134710963
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	505.57678233504106
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	1848.3390347849052
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	1529.0356554328096
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	404.1024411739828
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	731.2086158371836
g.	260.138348246505
as position.	173.61398171836697
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	957.133346872322
Baldhead over the blind.	458.25030998830135
Cute old codger.	1528.8029953898676
No use canvassing him for an ad.	733.5632527402515
Still he knows his own business best.	544.8723111178552
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	1214.5258842278756
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	639.3861028743569
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	345.7455331268971
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	200.92413039967974
Do you know what?	320.9693169161328
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	749.2777896925369
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	359.8333180108948
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	544.891649800712
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	835.069366368021
— Good day to you.	155.13752031491654
— Lovely weather, sir.	335.4792977131368
— ’ Tis all that.	157.69748554089213
Where do they get the money?	355.7988455535183
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	1716.8230137105322
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	1545.3884670346215
Then think of the competition.	255.70880913662498
General thirst.	769.3031286121428
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	1435.670365008976
Save it they can ’ t.	271.02145211248455
Off the drunks perhaps.	658.9223605317965
Put down three and carry five.	704.0139747345207
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	331.7862710296773
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	1232.854347824163
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	433.08093797549594
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	513.1210489493637
Say ten barrels of stuff.	825.5348124574382
Say he got ten per cent off.	1051.9000865164462
O more.	110.93440482960469
Fifteen.	227.25177915691472
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	781.3367313803228
Brats ’ clamour.	884.1151096864029
Windows open.	692.4123855648209
Fresh air helps memory.	2144.7995171317566
Or a lilt.	341.220355832127
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou.	26061.23706543947
Boys are they?	576.5232718950152

Mine.	227.25177915691472
Slieve Bloom.	301.9086931914699
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	638.9481842514623
Fifteen multiplied by.	761.7972362306315
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	855.0675764654322
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	1855.9981414119811
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	1349.143761687092
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	417.8165553113876
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	610.5791771099606
Chapped: washingsoda.	1230.1194716390055
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	393.01368726910647
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	1076.7329884423225
Woods his name is.	336.06025405765325
Wonder what he does.	277.0239560801333
Wife is oldish.	883.7150699204141
New blood.	431.41751995675617
No followers allowed.	1289.960826114808
Strong pair of arms.	526.3058497931751
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	801.2623494551299
She does whack it, by George.	401.26146557792
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	1364.3480431538196
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	1381.142980195911
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	971.2695253509459
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	4587.69491726342
Moses Montefiore.	772.3865696785816
I thought he was.	103.54101299616298
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	1191.2038494294848
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	631.2395697255323
A young white heifer.	600.8152231777052
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	1321.98800653024
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	872.9616931062207
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	1567.4717261344704
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	1427.2582157659099
— Now, my miss, he said.	149.9546913941402
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	1037.8370220816212
— Thank you, my miss.	217.2026464295213
And one shilling threepence change.	931.6677982668464
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	440.04562621723613
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	795.7887229240274
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	343.8107954560861
Hurry up, damn it.	282.26070497605747
Make hay while the sun shines.	1256.9553248061895
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	495.69975302153443
Sodachapped hands.	625.6652189206446
Crusted toenails too.	1421.592881210197
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	2268.8184972743184
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	1727.1145637007535
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	1049.417260280759
They like them sizeable.	526.5167568268546
Prime sausage.	1646.843470859384
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	327.4950669735331
— Threepence, please.	348.6061116552277
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	1220.3988762687022
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	887.0456304208167
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	618.5809216065456
— Thank you, sir.	160.39213813812026
Another time.	265.42404987405536
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	1537.3029976829007
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	673.6497049665431
No: better not: another time.	296.17172323533396
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	238.00252234054187
— Good morning, sir.	197.1626083965588
No sign.	241.06705006763386
Gone.	175.62105889062306
What matter?	299.5621820288576
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	859.8633221917536
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	1132.8633579277566
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	4170.782214118655
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	882.7029532395592
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	2175.830579982032
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	1483.8021582985627
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	5333.6353485361005
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	506.21838464893875
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	517.5412880154537
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	1120.5904547340651
Bleibtreustrasse <NUM>, Berlin, W.	473.406393873925
<NUM>.	46.55209544261272
Nothing doing.	416.11481892186845
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	515.5372662974229
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	2167.3678953985213
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	1378.0012870533517
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	1482.8962299365203
I have a few left from Andrews.	389.10844229567357
Molly spitting them out.	474.27933931118173
Knows the taste of them now.	311.6343829639468
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	2008.588839220449
Citrons too.	408.29824237311675
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	1018.102452492088
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	460.7804579069645
Pleasant evenings we had then.	880.6961379567729
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	565.7112573953708
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	521.809005645478
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	347.89592304553594
Always the same, year after year.	350.70845841521503
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	1229.8359406757681
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	1359.9809126170774
Must be without a flaw, he said.	296.3771298451991
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	533.7519648973633
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	1965.4048335997145
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	234.40241574046541
How do you?	244.31668135801323
Doesn ’ t see.	256.8530962268873
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	556.0324628972413
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	460.506063182177
Watering cart.	1288.724661018198
To provoke the rain.	580.4382529710888
On earth as it is in heaven.	310.37431328560206
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	716.6815092347443
Grey.	260.138348246505
Far.	180.3698566476659
No, not like that.	106.27899018033055
A barren land, bare waste.	979.034416685069
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	820.5750823711883
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	1859.894829261995
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	1105.3501482399968
All dead names.	438.9538796455234
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	307.4987154203752
Old now.	190.92657311475278
It bore the oldest, the first race.	376.42037033605055
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	1001.5393319337695
The oldest people.	503.95225691548274
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	1016.4991453492172
It lay there now.	289.7414600921222
Now it could bear no more.	485.17612956944674
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	485.46607373696185
Desolation.	412.94388766377165
Grey horror seared his flesh.	2080.096208610296
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	1216.0760831043747
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	2043.3739413443461
Well, I am here now.	214.88593324718136
Yes, I am here now.	196.78800559756516
Morning mouth bad images.	1527.1060255277441
Got up wrong side of the bed.	353.94184485953946
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	1066.805914255265
On the hands down.	179.5642512122083
Blotchy brown brick houses.	2928.979621055113
Number eighty still unlet.	2995.3944498052715
Why is that?	182.5148330898405
Valuation is only twentyeight.	1179.574015400413
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	1964.279795059577
Plasters on a sore eye.	668.346422062332
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	774.0921884921378
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	2147.823996518264
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	1892.9517984128154
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	415.0402139183666
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	526.9263706386477
He stooped and gathered them.	442.0781415016294
Mrs Marion Bloom.	301.79032330903823
His quickened heart slowed at once.	1551.1235939735893
Bold hand.	352.75966371003284
Mrs Marion.	269.87291704139983
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	1542.6436243883056
— Who are the letters for?	254.09745668300775
He looked at them.	168.6664619891997
Mullingar.	185.6778706854622
Milly.	121.76884119521016
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	240.13210254227334
And a letter for you.	141.62343853316054
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	787.6864545826716
— Do you want the blind up?	323.6038995108959
— That do?	197.02717409349435
he asked, turning.	140.11604923321738
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	462.90191014828565
— She got the things, she said.	158.277376861642
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	1077.3244862706233
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	237.74462617274176
I ’ m parched.	290.65321417049887
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	263.8909309110776
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	719.8540735872929
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	560.6349864103404
— Scald the teapot.	448.86374860285
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	806.2370609911247
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	869.5892621740448
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	1055.1050119810857
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	1366.4433511789257
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	779.6451448945692
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	766.1042086701574
Kosher.	260.138348246505
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	1128.593853781749
Pepper.	327.7537808406544
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	500.4273721280756
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	1914.4542248543432
The tea was drawn.	301.2723760628772
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	1140.4099677334762
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	972.1637285649535
No, wait: four.	208.39448575362368
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	774.7783373814844
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	832.775930845549
He smiled, pouring.	252.38507319977563
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	469.3083270132398
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	1092.421384397054
Poor old professor Goodwin.	733.606008883192
Dreadful old case.	589.8130163757064
Still he was a courteous old chap.	454.78608116813473
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	952.0100107532048
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	285.6565984047918
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	467.6880384884211
Sex breaking out even then.	931.3242003757134
Pert little piece she was.	666.5704967047923
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	740.2190862410945
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	987.2234314107696
Everything on it?	319.44432582087245
Yes.	72.08392493010007
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	831.5025042166139
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	559.7431786142768
— What a time you were! she said.	168.9767070337432
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	1364.8005410720334
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	621.5432514929204
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	1781.263559123227
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	597.8340518079035
— Who was the letter from?	209.1938798471129
he asked.	81.11898566253105
Bold hand.	352.75966371003284
Marion.	139.390526815372
— O, Boylan, she said.	116.32102296378966
He ’ s bringing the programme.	236.95073334015888
— What are you singing?	310.2610340817551
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	1596.1495650424608
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	552.9133824395163
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	428.0788775624689
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	1977.574615199613
Like foul flowerwater.	1515.8451684363765
— Would you like the window open a little?	353.014103603804
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	551.9786325794691
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	220.99817726896086
I didn ’ t see the paper.	193.55148063222154
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	577.3284052544404
No?	141.88871669435983
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	1612.8482145908313
— No: that book.	161.13502502531497
Other stocking.	744.0455299501654
Her petticoat.	363.7088463463506
— It must have fell down, she said.	263.1187698361851
He felt here and there.	200.05647891237078
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	4137.394556602739
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	963.6831852477289
Not in the bed.	123.82899900217885
Must have slid down.	470.6358573576529
He stooped and lifted the valance.	554.2447966470247
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	792.2640024376344
— Show here, she said.	194.24940501537534
I put a mark in it.	163.28077401751798
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	240.78009575965572
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	1037.8472467845108
— Met him what?	371.4925451785638
he asked.	81.11898566253105
What does that mean?	386.45785031979284
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	1321.3937193787665
— Metempsychosis?	392.7975256686866
— Yes.	84.75158391348033
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	213.359578584817
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	234.7402582166417
That means the transmigration of souls.	483.12896988969715
— O, rocks! she said.	166.63746411470137
Tell us in plain words.	505.4766090174008
The same young eyes.	251.35082876819874
The first night after the charades.	338.65686547407375
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	370.6401679865321
He turned over the smudged pages.	575.4475483386661
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	576.1962818042431
Hello.	131.45299260355975

Had to look the other way.	245.69082017819719
Mob gaping.	1218.8005344734222
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	883.8717145196115
Families of them.	267.79746891750017
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	1226.1634370360819
That we live after death.	484.56868942974324
Our souls.	359.57472186856336
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	305.61282220684484
Dignam ’ s soul...	98.69994647047554
— Did you finish it?	393.3487562076193
he asked.	81.11898566253105
— Yes, she said.	101.49765402994623
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	284.9971416413143
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	270.2257760607846
— Never read it.	218.2771618644061
Do you want another?	477.47008497182605
— Yes.	84.75158391348033
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	687.4425990422254
Nice name he has.	296.8643678319905
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	932.9541134248259
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	1333.9655003333319
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	209.0015048293992
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	472.42891344849386
They call it reincarnation.	529.2797254485728
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	809.3562452520567
They say we have forgotten it.	384.2121016619844
Some say they remember their past lives.	823.9884863637585
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	3529.349181563036
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	443.87666259316535
An example would be better.	579.4845115791455
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	452.7679296090135
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	2330.1080183348126
Tea before you put milk in.	487.6719869282314
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	757.322258924386
Three and six I gave for the frame.	368.4352141205554
She said it would look nice over the bed.	332.91808163302153
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	740.8198503588502
He turned the pages back.	240.08350324698827
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	617.8971133557295
What they called nymphs, for example.	454.40803786790303
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	976.8320097969535
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	1197.7324139398097
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	209.87840181980792
Did you leave anything on the fire?	492.10249500729225
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	362.68618764765466
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	1223.6828298962698
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	953.0566389096908
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	819.7375653473175
Only a little burnt.	459.54052852537086
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	796.4167011434524
Cup of tea now.	371.6313269337355
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	505.3487337870461
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	1332.27972876696
Done to a turn.	249.06623200199962
A mouthful of tea.	442.7789409734723
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	489.6591864780468
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	447.25653132797646
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	579.146552838295
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	1631.583178709393
It suits me splendid.	677.6808913183639
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	905.8845653065596
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	778.3388845125722
They are lovely.	249.8911951064157
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	556.1975403304602
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	348.8286335271283
Will send when developed.	1038.329918493127
We did great biz yesterday.	1209.7683271799067
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	297.6511286146908
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	1179.959203754418
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	577.9548082316476
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	383.39668495825794
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	549.615220534184
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	1068.8694209574844
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	1993.481778866188
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	1822.4953887808283
S.	82.15294473651714
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	1102.4044989616332
M.	83.95412797466348
Fifteen yesterday.	672.3210316399178
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	433.2941585809381
Her first birthday away from home.	730.0203820801784
Separation.	412.94388766377165
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	879.9658520293455
Jolly old woman.	446.6136098444715
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	732.5589407202971
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	620.3226761348349
Well, God is good, sir.	182.82577651741482
She knew at once.	281.8475993796257
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	418.25947467646824
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	1563.2707981583246
Excuse bad writing.	839.741324611756
Hurry.	227.25177915691472
Piano downstairs.	1101.3106049509342
Coming out of her shell.	342.22038217190305
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	812.9251844967755
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	743.316445474185
Saucebox.	412.94388766377165
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	962.829214621951
Twelve and six a week.	429.1419456480381
Not much.	192.20077345381364
Still, she might do worse.	341.20269170421005
Music hall stage.	1013.703833177332
Young student.	520.7776317692787
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	941.827468886741
Then he read the letter again: twice.	348.71916779666617
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	367.580155340871
But if not?	244.3608276272892
No, nothing has happened.	334.7999775438841
Wait in any case till it does.	455.04893489944885
A wild piece of goods.	565.1214730545437
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	897.4070107096047
Destiny.	327.7537808406544
Ripening now.	497.2282962903468
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	775.2669770283959
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	604.536825295887
Anemic a little.	345.998239155606
Was given milk too long.	734.6040221556806
Damned old tub pitching about.	2229.623450107819
Not a bit funky.	551.146778369221
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	749.0516549455805
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	1456.092102274094
Seaside girls.	711.7181204796806
Torn envelope.	872.9447086487241
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	460.07728122555784
Friend of the family.	239.8063419943387
Swurls, he says.	218.42687968153064
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	911.0440687112216
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	969.889271762299
Milly too.	194.29823591880114
Young kisses: the first.	354.7358115356944
Far away now past.	558.8753196893788
Mrs Marion.	269.87291704139983
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	736.7765499288221
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	1121.7109809406163
Will happen, yes.	371.2662023787165
Prevent.	412.94388766377165
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	495.0386591372227
Will happen too.	551.3079685276467
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	853.5607353264252
Useless to move now.	509.09684040185124
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	715.6371746296878
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	764.7784007969861
Better where she is down there: away.	348.23639444751535
Occupy her.	342.15758109850543
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	322.8976133540043
Might take a trip down there.	604.6836757529659
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	1105.1861997008205
Six weeks off, however.	581.6327897865816
Might work a press pass.	713.4686537501364
Or through M ’ Coy.	425.1036189733341
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	715.2145124400707
She looked back at him, mewing.	344.83741363175045
Wants to go out.	287.65561219808103
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	624.896731844916
Let her wait.	260.5776768648571
Has the fidgets.	388.9918363119638
Electric.	327.7537808406544
Thunder in the air.	265.4650063936607
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	400.8366722543038
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	613.3439961876854
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	416.781442858955
The cat mewed to him.	368.444327496524
— Miaow! he said in answer.	312.52383297307205
Wait till I ’ m ready.	414.21633304296444
Heaviness: hot day coming.	827.302478466716
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	697.2414868054365
A paper.	143.7049848020539
He liked to read at stool.	476.6428762506454
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	925.3214707056128
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	779.1522924394609
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	331.6140228276776
The cat went up in soft bounds.	616.93282318516
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	428.154805734547
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	402.7283629620512
Come.	92.48991349408898
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	615.5585377948458
No sound.	248.27099460396198
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	848.540742885935
The maid was in the garden.	222.15935703641804
Fine morning.	378.0738998857342
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	1073.3970619175857
Make a summerhouse here.	641.1985184882258
Scarlet runners.	1532.5605361623102
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	1058.3882071130954
A coat of liver of sulphur.	525.4997424351358
All soil like that without dung.	715.3371577312847
Household slops.	1449.406267364912
Loam, what is this that is?	339.5658811511962
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	1142.156982569334
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	718.0938233458328
Mulch of dung.	630.2903201872892
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	1010.3936873562494
Dirty cleans.	1646.843470859384
Ashes too.	408.29824237311675
Reclaim the whole place.	539.3340003345528
Grow peas in that corner there.	775.6683169117838
Lettuce.	412.94388766377165
Always have fresh greens then.	1133.0576668040696
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	1166.5805792027063
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	2169.6176838115953
He walked on.	132.05096565263065
Where is my hat, by the way?	215.90225485718386
Must have put it back on the peg.	370.32474112042684
Or hanging up on the floor.	352.498080808135
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	345.7103788331684
Hallstand too full.	723.2741715778333
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	959.8423450065122
Picking up the letters.	379.8740330592456
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	1127.5309426118945
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	461.6966466464719
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	1307.2427007614242
Just had a wash and brushup.	505.2518394350108
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	397.4735495576077
Tara street.	340.6859014831871
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	813.5317863567703
O ’ Brien.	213.16520046065713
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	1023.8247426803897
Agendath what is it?	327.64375572213237
Now, my miss.	202.76392676206277
Enthusiast.	412.94388766377165
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	587.5935770924658
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	759.1194318573863
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	499.8939913734253
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	2044.3839170997826
The king was in his countinghouse.	301.8489857253733
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	972.8449688845101
Something new and easy.	402.82589763735695
No great hurry.	502.59594266432504
Keep it a bit.	201.12935655031322
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	1648.8266110630652
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	1309.4698063975943
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	712.0157456985305
Three and a half.	155.2365054474427
Three pounds three.	533.5256618471768
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	507.3661730973484
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	694.3724400317903
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	1791.1327709043223
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	622.610366786719
No, just right.	157.80398547565315
So. Ah! Costive.	444.00123362229596
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	2695.6474137176315
Life might be so.	381.814069267522
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	639.6579344263957
Print anything now.	742.2878753863522
Silly season.	836.815098628263
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	767.4957592101823
Neat certainly.	832.229637843737
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	1258.0930060920875
Begins and ends morally.	1455.575142905349
_Hand in hand_.	948.0675505032634
Smart.	260.138348246505
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	978.2072420908937

Which?	302.39386776290775
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	1098.1562516624385
Dislike dressing together.	1242.8304441211058
Nicked myself shaving.	1826.6772034822645
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	1425.5290034229256

I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	463.02383302572196
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	658.82680892619
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	3409.0059282978536
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	1026.3539056281945
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	590.5250009341
Washing her teeth.	565.9083124099883
That was the first night.	152.0695275129728
Her fansticks clicking.	2347.487267959738
Is that Boylan well off?	516.3103050633413
He has money.	188.91383988893972
Why?	184.539251337404
No use humming then.	706.9163362605582
Allude to it.	234.59487486742796
Strange kind of music that last night.	516.9375212931684
The mirror was in shadow.	238.90218481278768
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	3116.999556501907
Peering into it.	349.5413458447914
Lines in her eyes.	280.2073606352926
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	678.5025604665075
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	1015.172644385865
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	1133.9706717999597
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	613.8412239963583
Still, true to life also.	307.66043132344095
Day: then the night.	214.05442464817946
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	928.4768793840707
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	794.0087835345171
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	739.2911619153841
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	595.8288673795247
What time is the funeral?	263.7321681315242
Better find out in the paper.	261.3385456970625
The bells of George ’ s church.	310.18856814831923
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	1035.209457085906
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	1188.9717947264671
There again: the overtone following through the air.	523.2382771161098
A third.	191.50581213673422
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	1976.9432596147362
Could have given that address too.	631.5847266055804
And past the sailors ’ home.	316.532406492961
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	705.4437847275989
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	1400.8426186121985
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	2016.9854756631248
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	582.297397383435
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	496.99639124392485
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	2574.1367922184672
Come home to ma, da.	571.2111307642242
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	660.5308713190271
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	893.7695240629541
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	522.6734885002666
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	722.2775179466606
At eleven it is.	267.5304144196427
Time enough.	348.96502596145075
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	860.71773475246
Corny.	126.24136856460238
Met her once in the park.	344.749132157179
What a lark.	234.07884947303918
Police tout.	1120.4710166696884
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	1138.402549109278
O, surely he bagged it.	347.9826840687561
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	801.3991493165386
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	497.94574011055823
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	1828.9678309462333
Rather warm.	503.2607092845268
Tea.	241.4910504830898
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	671.6469618888448
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	344.5948769972749
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	1168.661020048405
Very warm morning.	564.3967191311996
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	1821.8151650884354
Just there.	161.21125258199575
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	375.99727744877623
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	832.1672375513176
So warm.	269.6948097245117
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	666.6241444900471
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	752.1231358641215
The far east.	390.41990603606854
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	1201.3607988863437
Wonder is it like that.	170.84750443083445
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	936.0857467697315
Sleep six months out of twelve.	938.4136188462408
Too hot to quarrel.	720.8395380485877
Influence of the climate.	366.1320281862748
Lethargy.	327.7537808406544
Flowers of idleness.	785.1721527974769
The air feeds most.	729.9167342022635
Azotes.	412.94388766377165
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	1728.4966939904643
Sensitive plants.	1164.494185797461
Waterlilies.	412.94388766377165
Petals too tired to.	641.7342833602164
Sleeping sickness in the air.	564.5561222878916
Walk on roseleaves.	799.2040009498273
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	1956.3481970117573
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	420.3924928800129
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	474.64591805022513
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	862.3304052204755
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	227.31328919022047
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	437.11103129148563
It ’ s a law something like that.	200.199159102298
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	2028.2724286295502
The college curriculum.	730.5086945536392
Cracking curriculum.	1384.824771129642
What is weight really when you say the weight?	601.5636819902985
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	1744.114804004296
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	1329.4418992120861
They all fall to the ground.	240.06216180044487
The earth.	133.8750892984408
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	260.5062732315175
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	531.4568366825685
How did she walk with her sausages?	626.2216041893395
Like that something.	205.25501378859613
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	1134.7288549194125
Careless air: just drop in to see.	539.2828239648394
Per second per second.	1266.6071213618936
Per second for every second it means.	892.0783583289342
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	692.2143806681865
Too late box.	820.0326421499531
Post here.	400.22851103252833
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	501.26390532608417
— Are there any letters for me?	463.6973834532607
he asked.	81.11898566253105
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	1491.1775059311913
No answer probably.	470.2948250485777
Went too far last time.	742.3697526244947
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	662.2258385593703
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	856.0239794199908
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	2112.5015706666923
O.	51.15590757957263
Westland Row, City.	745.2995859366185
Answered anyhow.	878.7841292022875
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	1011.589767017751
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	469.17731880541385
Castoff soldier.	1288.724661018198
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	1593.06114446144
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	167.25112625181097
Pointed cuffs.	1532.5605361623102
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	631.2259019345333
Redcoats.	412.94388766377165
Too showy.	942.2000613132266
That must be why the women go after them.	404.08451189261103
Uniform.	327.7537808406544
Easier to enlist and drill.	1286.5696882489194
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	1089.8051013824024
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	1667.5761443732297
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	1310.9853363256123
Mark time.	299.6771382203689
Table: able.	662.9224959888766
Bed: ed.	1230.1194716390055
The King ’ s own.	207.50662039198565
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	763.8374461086419
A mason, yes.	279.1459498852217
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	258.84190529980464
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	835.7855060195153
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	700.4595053918941
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	547.9405178392389
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	537.5583904969773
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	870.0643339347318
No. M ’ Coy.	184.6921250820178
Get rid of him quickly.	494.5539680013729
Take me out of my way.	232.8363826785269
Hate company when you.	529.3121225232464
— Hello, Bloom.	119.85602051565985
Where are you off to?	242.78470212297688
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	238.79968068993193
Nowhere in particular.	586.8954535366698
— How ’ s the body?	169.05209869577635
— Fine.	176.4766640802636
How are you?	230.18846108359108
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	528.7881898667075
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	439.9044392866872
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	112.80584494730346
Poor Dignam, you know.	225.699465917319
The funeral is today.	305.9104665466515
— To be sure, poor fellow.	279.47840718326626
So it is.	121.28685716665777
What time?	194.6762256352492
A photo it isn ’ t.	355.55546026851084
A badge maybe.	817.5747486659209
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	156.54431054700086
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	293.9906792173267
Eleven, is it?	251.1383876810572
I only heard it last night.	284.7475020242066
Who was telling me?	355.42993324293457
Holohan.	260.138348246505
You know Hoppy?	752.792590829633
— I know.	81.22919249724826
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	554.2581499402256
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	458.0365510830694
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	363.1732862578463
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	816.115492954675
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	718.3765663860027
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	1167.9746158043606
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	774.6458678053028
Handsome is and handsome does.	568.3027709258873
Reserved about to yield.	882.4837607655262
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	776.4994246354382
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	542.1012780763373
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	377.40890994340083
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	379.6414902081228
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	498.4329646038556
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	454.6332440623498
In came Hoppy.	551.9828558926087
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	1554.9057993292574
Clearly I can see today.	649.4940215325751
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	1624.128239630163
Talking of one thing or another.	377.8878277761136
Lady ’ s hand.	189.76302074006125
Which side will she get up?	616.8303275365047
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	540.8288582396974
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	749.2014969889758
High brown boots with laces dangling.	1605.2190467843275
Wellturned foot.	752.004368219097
What is he foostering over that change for?	525.4858028986241
Sees me looking.	525.7841317217253
Eye out for other fellow always.	550.9833776749699
Good fallback.	729.3046545691309
Two strings to her bow.	564.6269974497766
— _Why? _ I said.	202.16277872834232
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	236.65025845887345
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	969.744104532273
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	125.3971520401951
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	295.66221284986835
Getting up in a minute.	362.94341884327054
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	779.2528138559823
He said.	63.313652580952436
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	300.5026516043081
And, faith, he filled up.	204.89788372860102
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	2288.242515426096
I said.	50.838666749084645
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	268.9451105298787
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	524.8922016267663
_Yes, _ he said.	177.58923760999278
_He ’ s gone.	276.78153265903575
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	650.4925615635228
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	2180.0197818196443
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	4230.587286685514
Lost it.	242.7851434614021
Curse your noisy pugnose.	2348.0525324306664
Feels locked out of it.	455.6246879255351
Paradise and the peri.	454.5438562412965
Always happening like that.	543.9889378233523
The very moment.	207.47185102140185
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	1743.0037238471073
Her friend covering the display of.	602.7402226475932
_Esprit de corps_.	2575.67833706176
Well, what are you gaping at?	361.5554260014957
Another gone.	389.1695641567335
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	198.73977775932025
The tram passed.	315.54482368218197
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	1312.9513382519704
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	697.2303424010172
— Wife well, I suppose?	327.9534881384085
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	351.5149209949506
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	124.39076955994598
Tiptop, thanks.	350.28917699898926
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	1874.5825383095348
Incomplete.	286.319300185858
With it an abode of bliss.	537.1342327550224
— My missus has just got an engagement.	940.9488030284342
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	494.7565050432839
Valise tack again.	1310.056394364856
By the way no harm.	318.7724267988405
I ’ m off that, thanks.	172.96555383323945
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	1353.2748699994543
— My wife too, he said.	167.79778512311992
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	633.7799123223251
— That so?	183.23801082922273
M ’ Coy said.	216.44156284246552
Glad to hear that, old man.	242.62395905341364
Who ’ s getting it up?	248.43350034140653
Mrs Marion Bloom.	301.79032330903823
Not up yet.	267.604370772323
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	540.81666412997
No book.	186.72973404625893
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	3041.1486693930683
Dark lady and fair man.	540.5614518800727
Letter.	260.138348246505
Cat furry black ball.	2123.7652309654036
Torn strip of envelope.	1107.5412772283187
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	1036.0829748667265
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	248.9312508998105
_Sweeeet song_.	2167.3678953985213
There ’ s a committee formed.	413.64927000935495
Part shares and part profits.	1798.903479840178
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	843.3695387535504
— O, well, he said.	90.86569575891569
That ’ s good news.	248.04093056857155
He moved to go.	193.89647227829732
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	280.6865875387669
Meet you knocking around.	1032.7085631806829
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	125.3971520401951
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	256.49089821733816
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	377.2802541555156
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	330.6149797573691
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	617.3836775380724
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	390.5019021102301
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	202.4225627715723
That ’ ll be all right.	213.7854910791709
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	442.960083391803
Thanks, old man.	184.63935290505944
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	316.71157646335223
Well, tolloll.	343.2305897059487
Just C.	266.9532366584215
P.	106.67968163325367
M ’ Coy will do.	323.991863767014
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	457.72450350003385
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	1102.3044506703814
The quick touch.	334.9633545022206
Soft mark.	646.9042430934185
I ’ d like my job.	228.53702903948644
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	544.6777735902493
Leather.	412.94388766377165
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	4110.736748841092
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	878.8247094697176
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	613.7897257844375
My missus has just got an.	707.8431993899252
Reedy freckled soprano.	4441.662893557492
Cheeseparing nose.	775.5328122731273
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	462.60473803243076
No guts in it.	206.74152989042855
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	211.0702170323423
Softsoaping.	412.94388766377165
Give you the needle that would.	313.90607124875567
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	382.91335836426373
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	323.159325800223
Against my grain somehow.	1695.5043178238213
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	960.8379093385854
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	716.1082311412497
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	1011.127896395394
Your wife and my wife.	309.9036047897166
Wonder is he pimping after me?	682.7605143603464
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	535.6429980324275
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	1605.3238265664713
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	1543.2945675711019
No, he ’ s going on straight.	170.80823399917097
Hello.	131.45299260355975
_Leah_ tonight.	694.2273746204114
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	1075.745021452522
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	698.7695798594102
Male impersonator.	1532.5605361623102
Perhaps he was a woman.	187.22062803495902
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	2810.166919744491
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	819.370400256084
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	622.4338189463024
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	513.2871984738728
And Ristori in Vienna.	749.4093183654172
What is this the right name is?	255.8691996963351
By Mosenthal it is.	411.63188021842245
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	631.4785851037994
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	431.57348499646247
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	523.770096954646
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	400.1773258224896
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	529.8865049361485
No use thinking of it any more.	397.27072087052665
Nosebag time.	503.9948625260005
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	646.2199614334943
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	999.4714410117141
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	1264.561366191184
Their Eldorado.	884.8242381027072
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	1524.8431928010393
Too full for words.	409.4155383028363
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	687.2213863582924
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	2079.148673148382
Might be happy all the same that way.	352.97549812081235
Good poor brutes they look.	672.9409550140587
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	1535.6463527068006
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	435.78979143787757
Might just walk into her here.	542.7635799996037
The lane is safer.	590.3769734180162
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	322.2379534907842
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	915.9882970738327
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	513.1295629733036
_Voglio e non_.	2491.6732688821385
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	654.910451098604
Sociable.	412.94388766377165
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	1425.5983427757471
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	8027.348002294453
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	607.2225128645192
No - one.	184.4742532433252
Meade ’ s timberyard.	567.1210009106773
Piled balks.	1822.5318937766035
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	1943.3258518810644
Not a sinner.	311.89759950280586
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	1184.437201204117
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	1280.3294370095375
Pity to disturb them.	512.5460857873902
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	667.3023048035961
Open it.	189.98964215116064
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	604.0623127011439
She liked mignonette.	925.7493200431874
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	273.20841094771254
And Mr?	155.6476227115242
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	399.9272342657949
A flower.	186.34845513268078
I think it ’ s a.	90.2199988837806
Not annoyed then?	953.5733967481275
What does she say?	377.6093237096764
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	555.4975778749404
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	487.92302273104355
Why did you enclose the stamps?	818.6426736127332
I am awfully angry with you.	406.14698219709317
I do wish I could punish you for that.	339.7774714167669
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	479.1333082649769
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	576.2160688744029
I do wish I could do something for you.	306.98869433728527
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	412.6847000730579
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	268.35758481373387
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	690.9663582642467
I think of you so often you have no idea.	310.42333877771756
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	410.1102725289729
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	505.55185846215335
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	466.76560351319193
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	369.65062953333415
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	1313.0183137686445
Then I will tell you all.	229.13614773783513
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	676.4329930881079
today.	104.33430937162939
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	1885.6762006396086
S.	82.15294473651714
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	799.1838340298692
I want to know.	127.77887933056248
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	1184.7556203394624
They like it because no - one can hear.	426.27728156890527
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	831.2347669737534
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	532.3291640173945
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	3207.860045519891
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	403.6841795831521
Weak joy opened his lips.	1070.357774325322
Changed since the first letter.	626.8488408828872
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	531.2856605521135
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	645.81905935292
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	907.4588400685421
Thank you: not having any.	340.08198553141574
Usual love scrimmage.	1672.749111276329
Then running round corners.	798.0428102147799
Bad as a row with Molly.	396.7942526423184
Cigar has a cooling effect.	1291.4319061533752
Narcotic.	412.94388766377165
Go further next time.	863.8232816378905
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	516.3939239743653
Brutal, why not?	539.3996692151875
A bit at a time.	167.21795631316064
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	402.2388530840383
Common pin, eh?	1162.9224474042737
He threw it on the road.	204.0188506509481
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	754.5057939434414
Queer the number of pins they always have.	512.2893109323894
No roses without thorns.	1207.969603452024
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	1072.03513312383
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	570.1554532499671
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	439.41562941849213
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	390.78706233028277
It?	135.15547369239349
Them.	286.319300185858
Such a bad headache.	716.1363695131876
Has her roses probably.	780.7982711317849
Or sitting all day typing.	981.9604256081126
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	1751.2007555873274
What perfume does your wife use.	780.1344818453659
Now could you make out a thing like that?	354.70417567092744
To keep it up.	233.52612640651674
Martha, Mary.	214.0026472410635
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	875.3191626681485
He is sitting in their house, talking.	245.51628658982247
Mysterious.	327.7537808406544
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	632.9889426136793
To keep it up.	233.52612640651674
Nice kind of evening feeling.	616.5529478510883
No more wandering about.	418.8367124787147
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	1873.5699337981898
Forget.	260.138348246505
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	793.5340851586703
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	535.3857283367621
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	882.4651017709141
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	799.3652858955505
Tell her: more and more: all.	202.29327383784954
Then a sigh: silence.	360.5218386908629
Long long long rest.	596.5269254048645
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	920.0968520510384
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	884.4838554245838
Henry Flower.	370.74211683367434
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	504.4473536107844
Simple bit of paper.	484.6529818960724
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	1313.5316767437346
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	364.78731705887424
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	735.3534995017329
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	3564.488575941537
A million pounds, wait a moment.	450.30935083261215
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	704.4996751486108
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	613.8374676644164
Yes, exactly.	173.47334567141536
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	811.2737194881079
What am I saying barrels?	664.507735212846
Gallons.	412.94388766377165
About a million barrels all the same.	539.4392502587388
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	2815.716630126081
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	2162.6484879495547
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	2585.3839623734293
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	780.3156225566147
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	802.7889111161833
Damn it.	168.27383147526334
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	526.5164493671599
Same notice on the door.	348.58634606381855
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	826.0042615422605

Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	928.07073993752
The protestants are the same.	280.78621809965716
Convert Dr William J.	1507.8236494435228
Walsh <URL>. to the true religion.	387.222284618945
Save China ’ s millions.	747.4369165621126
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	948.9164480003742
Prefer an ounce of opium.	1592.9425996175303
Celestials.	412.94388766377165
Rank heresy for them.	1115.63681772436
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	713.1742370508105
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	630.2162658797913
Not like Ecce Homo.	1778.5581979594288
Crown of thorns and cross.	627.1549647456983
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	1406.9292536727205
Chopsticks?	884.205033265537
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	717.2031573535893
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	967.5678629809635
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	767.5024300076366
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	665.5241651032609
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	718.5820819003524
Still life.	210.32177624499096
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	371.47151123390194
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	655.9343136991043
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	961.6169198533438
Something going on: some sodality.	610.159667028292
Pity so empty.	587.735886864147
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	906.0251326198248
Who is my neighbour?	473.46856369476114
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	550.1515780241565
That woman at midnight mass.	642.2327122347982
Seventh heaven.	667.7315413521577
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	1701.4396827600913
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	794.7979787736333
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	353.87057392745317
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	483.824217415342
Her hat and head sank.	440.66357671208664
Then the next one.	176.76236071737844
Her hat sank at once.	610.7617843149383
Then the next one: a small old woman.	310.03115577911035
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	384.3222343339277
Latin.	180.3698566476659
The next one.	174.9071928826135
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	512.1703060371648
What?	116.16450681686501
_Corpus: _ body.	372.00196520516454
Corpse.	286.319300185858
Good idea the Latin.	386.1063246809742
Stupefies them first.	543.6574169133423
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	634.2709316855191
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	1014.5007782703876
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	498.93875323363017
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	891.9797760318962
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	654.362949544927
These pots we have to wear.	865.510110872321
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	1002.4242972177314
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	674.623242433795
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	941.8127854661095
Look at them.	188.73624027969484
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	787.6781255985898
Lollipop.	412.94388766377165
It does.	171.5468627494415
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	260.69295219029055
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	400.7924177264662
Hokypoky penny a lump.	1012.7697662741801
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	424.1404109365124
They do.	127.95471551159996
I ’ m sure of that.	129.22646218888596
Not so lonely.	394.3889528598552
In our confraternity.	582.834768789853
Then come out a bit spreeish.	585.1451948505202
Let off steam.	552.628123259222
Thing is if you really believe in it.	444.4940658929366
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	1028.2803076053292
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	1252.3134923843863
Hence those snores.	1527.697569074202
Blind faith.	744.0455299501654
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	389.13491531912734
Lulls all pain.	839.741324611756
Wake this time next year.	893.5541637622308
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	764.6585783169681
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	242.9074605471007
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	214.1468948019567
Bald spot behind.	747.1474223096773
Letters on his back: <URL>	477.4049370458861
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	268.85700495449413
And the other one?	159.56772322901242
Iron nails ran in.	851.4364006633285
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	900.2564710066063
Do not deny my request.	889.095589381657
Dusk and the light behind her.	296.5259119807964
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	418.44339349244757
Their character.	391.8444264694712
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	520.8298834185563
This very church.	414.7501155337752
Peter Carey, yes.	442.07188192690467
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	474.9450171010944
Denis Carey.	724.703133682456
And just imagine that.	277.8328318498656
Wife and six children at home.	577.7005485608033
And plotting that murder all the time.	443.4163464312731
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	441.7763982329165
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	579.0205812933325
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	159.30607233022658
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	378.55523596761196
Yes: under the bridge.	197.93543576932228
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	959.28300065383
Wine.	227.25177915691472
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	1905.6518435430228
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	510.78509254369686
Cold comfort.	851.3738632039496
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	1542.7168959889188
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	283.99807253552456
Quite right.	282.77850634473674
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	398.73336172828897
Not going to be any music.	358.16170272559515
Pity.	191.6715737888812
Who has the organ here I wonder?	527.9152660575679
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	931.6268108057585
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	621.4017936719891
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	1066.7797057816456
Christ or Pilate?	974.1067764546673
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	376.50251540477535
Music they wanted.	434.5970015647896
Footdrill stopped.	933.9704516577415
Could hear a pin drop.	806.0601891212626
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	445.967090770583
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	615.9047022871216
Mercadante: seven last words.	749.1253022084182
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	788.705152494904
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	962.4695337201543
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	660.4979776287718
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	1417.2699438739396
Benedictine.	412.94388766377165
Green Chartreuse.	1012.4598556494906
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	580.007114088979
What kind of voice is it?	250.9730793502989
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	1207.1401050099619
Connoisseurs.	412.94388766377165
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	585.1313448481915
Kind of a placid.	401.5354495788933
No worry.	462.08438790511644
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	491.6563785248166
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	529.1613027455453
Who knows?	391.40707013198994
One way out of it.	155.82158645237007
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	485.6950891112554
All crossed themselves and stood up.	471.5812122695747
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	507.26529129477393
Stand up at the gospel of course.	360.6024550988383
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	662.2674554510799
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	398.26777082120606
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	440.1016253259511
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	345.92066470716196
English.	141.22482304644274
Throw them the bone.	431.3432032255518
I remember slightly.	298.0596553273424
How long since your last mass?	988.3853805596439

No browbeating him.	455.2652224122637
He had his answer pat for everything.	554.044035242564
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	507.7469054504806
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	811.3834249787592
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	962.2089970267807
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	415.6758310925872
All over.	133.30914720160257
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	814.1135480568851
Brother Buzz.	942.2000613132266
Come around with the plate perhaps.	455.37903878513595
Pay your Easter duty.	1441.6616538882588
He stood up.	155.69127578601098
Hello.	131.45299260355975
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	654.8121915895282
Women enjoy it.	456.3695208522229
Never tell you.	240.97618796911925
But we.	132.45719795852477
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	462.5539914225664
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	1153.8496182315125
Glimpses of the moon.	285.5407796999125
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	415.5742559957599
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	356.0413742112037
Still like you better untidy.	622.1937517513395
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	791.1547680417103
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	585.719182682804
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	1448.767075676865
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	625.2867715895557
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	631.396425201207
He covered himself.	275.56339798587044
How goes the time?	305.78458065447177
Quarter past.	526.1196397393004
Time enough yet.	595.6054570382178
Better get that lotion made up.	564.8495070896095
Ah yes, the last time.	193.43358784829354
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	498.7618554673159

He walked southward along Westland row.	1527.9472881687477
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	265.7012658598071
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	275.08373547619635
Bore this funeral affair.	1489.8101399826755
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	220.01184110411265
When was it I got it made up last?	362.04959101135955
Wait.	107.93485186050891
I changed a sovereign I remember.	362.57626314528295

O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	293.492683587944

— About a fortnight ago, sir?	558.9171922367489
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	125.3971520401951
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	1136.1452293427974
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	1106.8826864527152
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	597.0581433959812
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	1152.645439887256
— And white wax also, he said.	278.474614438112
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	304.7005207238449

Feel fresh then all the day.	373.7037466399849
Funeral be rather glum.	1446.610531159532
That was two and nine.	205.8119192532205
Have you brought a bottle?	513.3857546622468
— No, Mr Bloom said.	121.50117658025843
Make it up, please.	249.4302314664505
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	372.8112123806938
— Fourpence, sir.	260.3387434611603
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	424.0355917137844
Sweet lemony wax.	2100.7784387093307
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	158.70323725404168
That makes three and a penny.	335.0304250802763
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	167.26712765654506
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	362.37351145244384
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	139.97342161164548
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	566.766863536215
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	501.3923896199146
What ’ s the best news?	265.6435736212866
Is that today ’ s?	244.87140197427104
Show us a minute.	445.69653929466534
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	1568.6713560721796
He does look balmy.	568.5409529606903
Younger than I am.	564.6176876972928
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	1722.4428997153059
Wants a wash too.	475.18155324437015
Take off the rough dirt.	756.0830022060393
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	792.5856406022792
Dandruff on his shoulders.	488.71754362909314
Scalp wants oiling.	2802.499824395247
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	461.3087728917677
Where the bugger is it?	298.2279495084587
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	1172.15008636452
Barber ’ s itch.	636.5718003214608
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	646.3639393381978
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	345.05660125288915
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	215.2289935795631
— Ascot.	221.9076569734492
Gold cup.	415.8326113543926
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	893.4064481946099
Half a mo.	481.29754103540466
Maximum the second.	319.70302130252776
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	235.44021906414085
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	1877.9156185186382
— What ’ s that?	114.48218109093882
his sharp voice said.	253.2878746993884
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	259.3824765974908
I was going to throw it away that moment.	274.2061818896204
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	1167.2119074255643
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	165.5491057843105
Here, thanks.	201.8229767172029
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	777.5870278455444
God speed scut.	1312.40839585872
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	515.5477222350388
Silly lips of that chap.	375.76671438642836
Betting.	327.7537808406544
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	1528.2269106681515

Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	1552.7090536443218
Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	2868.974887244536
Keeps a hotel now.	508.83619493076185
They never come back.	300.9474896601151
Fleshpots of Egypt.	561.7785369990206
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	768.5351781624696
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	810.1633277763749
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	1182.9805267013078
Damn bad ad.	755.5760296153222
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	450.67757193149635
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	714.3543337212053
Something to catch the eye.	288.71660010042075
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	468.85412875811426
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	396.12925517811414
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	425.8390061637498
How do you do, sir?	266.61008475944675
Heavenly weather really.	1582.3809165111306
If life was always like that.	268.51139836884386
Cricket weather.	1067.3833048955426
Sit around under sunshades.	1421.465734848037
Over after over.	323.9061786740328
Out.	141.22482304644274
They can ’ t play it here.	311.8401900987164
Duck for six wickets.	1734.6642403309513
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	1441.6786307611821
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	638.1836049857044
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	879.9880876298828
Heatwave.	412.94388766377165
Won ’ t last.	310.19748034473315
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	551.7349429285596
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	1467.0132623000477
This is my body.	289.75555494205736
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	1213.3263154310825
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	1398.381638731731
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	606.096793572349
— Come on, Simon.	156.25580883318435
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	152.40373999128514
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	366.71485517437867
— Are we all here now?	403.20700404107754
Martin Cunningham asked.	351.08743109124464
Come along, Bloom.	166.56608875078945
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	410.16722436417456
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	643.8149885598096
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	957.3845394884318
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	1202.9942572376376
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	608.3771670720306
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	567.0965553991238
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	864.685783118487
Job seems to suit them.	871.7456410881503
Huggermugger in corners.	737.9478527123171
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	940.2373426595373
Then getting it ready.	429.01867405327226
Laying it out.	328.87577360020794
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	525.5623218913317
Pull it more to your side.	381.99115420119296
Our windingsheet.	604.7301892702525
Never know who will touch you dead.	589.1171442369741
Wash and shampoo.	1017.8659189330191
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	331.65048383647013
Keep a bit in an envelope.	360.4608612243101
Grows all the same after.	365.9444980421254
Unclean job.	841.5297364205848
All waited.	287.4961315964247
Nothing was said.	179.4372993620454
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	704.4782667437051
I am sitting on something hard.	406.2425731457285
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	391.94197027818507
Better shift it out of that.	251.20537184106308
Wait for an opportunity.	413.08934786495263
All waited.	287.4961315964247
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	740.0836131360378
A jolt.	363.63677483853303
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	837.6058917651181
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	1930.989721860845
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	1184.215452989626
At walking pace.	642.4778609757666
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	832.5620612040908
Tritonville road.	622.4483245920537
Quicker.	327.7537808406544
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	1968.1789314859834
— What way is he taking us?	338.711339452483
Mr Power asked through both windows.	697.6227629370934
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	323.3855288715034
Ringsend.	227.25177915691472
Brunswick street.	356.5738359877806
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	312.11056888404596
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	214.41487766420425
I am glad to see it has not died out.	389.7139841469355
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	1804.7789914348275
Respect.	286.319300185858
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	1575.2520263083634
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	633.5878912394628
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	210.68968867889265
— Who is that?	166.89571927655575
— Your son and heir.	386.11681034837216
— Where is he?	168.21299323088348
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	446.6710004710983
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	1450.797214165025
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	582.4127979284746
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	509.2392471555135
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	689.8714473197851
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	1227.8991297248924
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	2210.9384614371825
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	540.8613599907252
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	510.68350178066197
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	910.8680068052493
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	1005.4528812363342
Out on the rampage all night.	442.29896325936
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	359.49167718538104
Wife ironing his back.	644.2180323036927
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	660.2570624558475
All breadcrumbs they are.	574.2989519699196
About six hundred per cent profit.	3188.5580348445783
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	402.6134433757745
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	1661.514078282284
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	534.3413730860485
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	402.3959790194754
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	618.9569521841814
A counterjumper ’ s son.	373.92136381347206
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	1253.7016418414335
Not likely.	380.74596647812774
He ceased.	194.2982359188013
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	680.2164483454864
Noisy selfwilled man.	1537.0591619118652
Full of his son.	211.39805735088004
He is right.	117.38989148662256
Something to hand on.	182.7883552266638
If little Rudy had lived.	771.5065445579575
See him grow up.	378.6664321234773
Hear his voice in the house.	233.2101002276653
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	1434.9541365338644
My son.	212.2927665793419
Me in his eyes.	172.61494529654465
Strange feeling it would be.	483.4295207723151
From me.	138.14867831929791
Just a chance.	259.9193619572114
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	610.2052100068141
And the sergeant grinning up.	471.91042984702653
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	723.2102236308698
Give us a touch, Poldy.	358.101853083652
God, I ’ m dying for it.	177.22073298287324
How life begins.	498.09579698645933
Got big then.	363.8168865874139
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	1111.4630447353293
My son inside her.	390.38544479641746
I could have helped him on in life.	264.0176265096576
I could.	72.03772202923273
Make him independent.	553.6295603453809
Learn German too.	1017.1277294655638
— Are we late?	504.4333434562142
Mr Power asked.	245.20062280315582
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	426.839655334457
Molly.	100.67956842369696
Milly.	121.76884119521016
Same thing watered down.	1082.324600002878
Her tomboy oaths.	1548.7640102557602
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	873.1419502519723
Soon be a woman.	307.1077442247761
Mullingar.	185.6778706854622
Dearest Papli.	1218.8005344734222
Young student.	520.7776317692787
Yes, yes: a woman too.	173.6322990448989
Life, life.	183.17901559640018
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	982.3855045556894
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	792.8270357339259
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	406.58768845989385
Do you follow me?	456.8964693125232
He closed his left eye.	330.19914127537
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	1271.33331271342
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	134.1842709906789
Crumbs?	701.7939999806459
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	894.6683517590013
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	1646.5893444859635
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	867.5536727780764
What do you think, Martin?	282.4130523850943
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	353.51052320050024
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	402.6329149313963
Glad I took that bath.	476.76932173465656
Feel my feet quite clean.	896.3362597956867
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	1690.1467386735142
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	887.4683320149509
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	170.587327207345
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	833.6607366422207
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	627.9775127406836
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	180.34278322684318
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	311.2007189338904
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	578.7193079540656
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	327.47377328646684
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	317.30345345808166
He said he ’ d try to come.	226.97274962639563
The carriage halted short.	599.4240579747857
— What ’ s wrong?	207.46590571050905
— We ’ re stopped.	282.1237325589363
— Where are we?	290.9943527612985
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	201.9056869887621
— The grand canal, he said.	240.4733995374433
Whooping cough they say it cures.	1510.2391896941153
Good job Milly never got it.	631.5746931066266
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	955.1382968874306
Shame really.	605.6499336603808
Only measles.	904.2825514929508
Flaxseed tea.	782.0231924014118
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	2027.2472368895853
Canvassing for death.	556.3990002701996
Don ’ t miss this chance.	500.3620202322709
Dogs ’ home over there.	396.91761303889285
Thy will be done.	545.9223576313757
We obey them in the grave.	358.10441912800445
A dying scrawl.	711.740157987804
He took it to heart, pined away.	346.5086310474859
Quiet brute.	950.8055212138433
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	648.5056982923131
A raindrop spat on his hat.	743.4756442956212
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	1406.4477650068875
Apart.	412.94388766377165
Curious.	206.4719438318858
Like through a colander.	565.0629155375616
I thought it would.	146.69947232323074
My boots were creaking I remember now.	693.8017564780375
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	376.4610166057433
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	469.49018975219826
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	266.8283147140951
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	238.4397139540717
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	934.6558676331872
— We ’ re off again.	252.98267924760086
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	1800.0272694445448
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	413.54719977714467
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	482.21611499584094
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	303.47041179266563
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	771.4435148881682
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	784.4210844481557
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	735.5626498566005
And the retrospective arrangement.	412.1878738678106
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	807.3566739249169
Martin Cunningham asked.	351.08743109124464
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	175.73185502938097
Where is it?	185.7588719679392
— In the paper this morning.	235.13673770492971
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	362.49740634537494
That book I must change for her.	336.58842044803635
Later on please.	555.180755906259
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	770.2990579167545
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	396.5096322822148
no, Sexton, Urbright.	443.6415392166989
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	3048.9960746923907
Thanks to the Little Flower.	396.6343235766092
Sadly missed.	942.2000613132266
To the inexpressible grief of his.	365.5824512732672
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	1138.4130192110133
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	753.307480982841
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	1568.3375310298832
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	1395.511331714696
I tore up the envelope?	396.0493543543377
Yes.	72.08392493010007
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	399.67286089467956
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	732.442406119974
There all right.	179.84393668010358
Dear Henry fled.	1339.086044918188
Before my patience are exhausted.	1255.7403835135735
National school.	550.655302475467
Meade ’ s yard.	405.351874716529
The hazard.	285.4416756800943
Only two there now.	314.9087229474561
Nodding.	412.94388766377165
Full as a tick.	567.6121863690726
Too much bone in their skulls.	835.4577590176369
The other trotting round with a fare.	503.108063773618
An hour ago I was passing there.	521.3908750561039
The jarvies raised their hats.	847.0892565304109
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	1317.952330992017
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	1642.0191121316282
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	706.1174767996852
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	925.2326709133414
Antient concert rooms.	1814.0491914752179
Nothing on there.	206.70686525490606
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	857.1805963787837
Not much grief there.	496.83205612696725
Quarter mourning.	760.4079559269045
People in law perhaps.	488.1830364836938
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	690.0592188343107
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	2373.7650101432987
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	532.5750244310253
I said I.	59.25730285731285
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	905.1390993709607
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	4736.134476005776
Big powerful change.	1004.3047628563961
Wet bright bills for next week.	1578.2341584974674
_Fun on the Bristol_.	665.4784742312296
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	540.167948212893
Have to stand a drink or two.	392.1761203065968
As broad as it ’ s long.	290.93023799236306
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	158.11000825668114
Her songs.	410.6456301538045
Plasto ’ s.	184.24910690121462
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	3263.674357016341
Who was he?	152.81450686589093
— How do you do?	271.7873717061897
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	558.0256695551801
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	282.0635461749073
Yes, he does.	119.07317437293902
How do you do?	304.38376413874647
— Who?	160.92060442380037
Mr Dedalus asked.	202.40175295641495
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	294.53684987637234
There he is airing his quiff.	703.9307517184548
Just that moment I was thinking.	307.9934151595929
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	637.6304638109847
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	1059.5754861348423
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	359.2216619509049
The nails, yes.	196.59771570066766
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	494.0690805903094
Fascination.	412.94388766377165
Worst man in Dublin.	371.1097141839647
That keeps him alive.	583.6953885554819
They sometimes feel what a person is.	441.0832403947046
Instinct.	286.319300185858
But a type like that.	228.32744389298247
My nails.	344.4261533868917
I am just looking at them: well pared.	551.2309310433483
And after: thinking alone.	359.71488387663896
Body getting a bit softy.	1105.854349501509
I would notice that: from remembering.	367.8612106162725
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	778.9820628213395
But the shape is there.	202.92301534822283
The shape is there still.	316.99948810333296
Shoulders.	412.94388766377165
Hips.	412.94388766377165
Plump.	412.94388766377165
Night of the dance dressing.	419.53395395476485
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	1082.09314412226
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	758.7505238337257
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	485.6284316786621
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	156.37214571395648
I hear great accounts of it.	316.1257915858582
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	116.80801123276042
— Are you going yourself?	472.61682663244466
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	165.66752627605194
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	607.7841494755054
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	583.0805337910574
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	303.47941731560775
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	310.50977445853323
Mary Anderson is up there now.	519.6281110208623
Have you good artists?	922.5166816762232
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	628.9638642410766
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	385.84161242486715
J.	70.96904591365316
C.	96.23846299732125
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	567.9419974663821
The best, in fact.	151.83707418341493
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	449.6124115533325
Last but not least.	459.40344155976413
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	765.7989077309581
Smith O ’ Brien.	533.2300512449701
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	713.815257241405
Woman.	154.75327256732697
Must be his deathday.	489.6578114636161
For many happy returns.	1021.3075924972509
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	1289.2242986510219
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	636.5028479368574
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	545.6878462367968
Had his office in Hume street.	689.1580744392958
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	959.7685692961687
Has that silk hat ever since.	758.3838234760865
Relics of old decency.	780.3933974560659
Mourning too.	408.29824237311675
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	1670.2010499640794
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	436.7411344792126
Twenty past eleven.	748.7883182582353
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	383.937167285147
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	2414.6256021775926
No: _vorrei e non_.	1638.827895191317
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	617.006828140287
_Mi trema un poco il_.	11349.155275289291
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	988.547212915064
A thrush.	328.5829183303205
A throstle.	328.5829183303205
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	564.3613348695295
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	728.5797376344875
Greyish over the ears.	483.2292530467033
_Madame_: smiling.	535.4405994784338
I smiled back.	176.5700628925745
A smile goes a long way.	401.2290710571122
Only politeness perhaps.	966.8619475225797
Nice fellow.	296.9474076355611
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	530.6207008057476
Not pleasant for the wife.	279.01123979269585
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	369.00251901242854
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	877.702773584308
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	636.3455725710753
What is this she was?	213.2283854588847
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	491.50110607746245
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	848.0134185592239
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	1115.657854197811
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	217.6668853253399
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	1024.479469817198
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	425.65141247596506
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	833.0439771448167
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	489.43275092161343
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	285.55181991200044
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	457.32992499562573
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	804.6669376541664
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	381.25554251103733
— Yes.	84.75158391348033
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	527.793244284375
— What is that?	138.17203588498518
Mr Dedalus asked.	202.40175295641495
I didn ’ t hear it.	192.99381446390532
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	271.88177552114695
— What?	121.21994813499828
Mr Dedalus asked.	202.40175295641495
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	1280.1288630956903
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	186.99451545977863
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	1011.3465914732697
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	756.2967303557704
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	83.67605768705963
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	922.3751642845214
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	578.8817429428137
Is he dead?	310.8459241015481
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	546.2214082734205
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	600.9077544493368
Half the town was there.	270.29034198769114
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	125.3971520401951
But the funny part is.....	104.97299239182802
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	547.7847462844786
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	682.2170001208104
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	275.0224256991169
Like a hero.	269.99712632763794
A silver florin.	553.9975722166832
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	454.6141604872861
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	283.53182650275215
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	530.3217490674012
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	694.9933728521482
Nelson ’ s pillar.	317.4645012166792
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	833.7236038637002
Mr Dedalus sighed.	341.97645439814346
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	566.4020966432716
Many a good one he told himself.	370.8457602631242
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	549.2533724587167
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	541.3745758787193
He ’ s gone from us.	177.28050563991152
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	455.29592226559515
He went very suddenly.	342.7050368117503
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	370.98874877071114
Heart.	171.33589738740352
He tapped his chest sadly.	853.8307180426648
Blazing face: redhot.	1048.850023786214
Too much John Barleycorn.	1187.7332997034528
Cure for a red nose.	535.8421424211739
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	1056.3283282940781
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	673.4892821312465
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	1201.833966885981
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	226.3624703846289
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	209.10066403298617
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	631.7605349082086
— No suffering, he said.	176.5266179389965
A moment and all is over.	179.48055766658354
Like dying in sleep.	436.23120189492045
No - one spoke.	349.07794963947634
Dead side of the street this.	249.52450000509484
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	1373.1111217271698
Why?	184.539251337404
Some reason.	397.48392507940855
Sun or wind.	540.6896451689636
At night too.	264.305989632944
Chummies and slaveys.	886.1037490870675
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	808.3013759306264

Breakdown.	327.7537808406544
Heart.	171.33589738740352
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	1939.943910578556
A tiny coffin flashed by.	869.421609073217
In a hurry to bury.	396.67454549794934
A mourning coach.	589.4508201494863
Unmarried.	412.94388766377165
Black for the married.	223.93697890836873
Piebald for bachelors.	999.969135242615
Dun for a nun.	423.4003488357744
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	296.54583748904975
A child.	157.38255165150372
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	492.36872607459236
Dwarf ’ s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	988.2104895954408
Burial friendly society pays.	3083.714335602715
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	661.8089220705934

If not from the man.	152.19933522320878
Better luck next time.	681.5874948458135
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	272.77216979407126
It ’ s well out of it.	128.5373833860905
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	1092.0141718575196
Rattle his bones.	556.4427759355813
Over the stones.	282.12170470959904
Only a pauper.	375.98030988496566
Nobody owns.	1101.3106049509342
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	293.36384417239407
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	274.26926507011626
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	787.9753082419602
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	429.29288987949633
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	740.4766949400736
We must take a charitable view of it.	550.0274956091824
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	339.943060192936
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	327.9299430438339
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	269.29963026290545
Looking away now.	386.4277083120987
Sympathetic human man he is.	458.67867903013445
Intelligent.	412.94388766377165
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	275.9677707642627
Always a good word to say.	308.0536704410285
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	598.2016039717782
Refuse christian burial.	2505.751415233504
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	569.4285337165746
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	1445.9244152863248
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	1532.0939307476108
He looked at me.	160.4224735969996
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	319.52362408946374
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	998.3087566960386
Leading him the life of the damned.	263.67722595564186
Monday morning.	336.16051581995913
Start afresh.	1822.5318937766035
Shoulder to the wheel.	416.28403918576436
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	355.33285943607484
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	564.8402945028245
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	707.8599922451239
He looked away from me.	233.46019774547815
He knows.	129.93506154471987
Rattle his bones.	556.4427759355813
That afternoon of the inquest.	404.88413032567195
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	514.6569002258817
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	519.3957404875821
Stuffy it was.	276.6676687228881
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	981.6324999363585
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	763.659353919009
Boots giving evidence.	1719.5152268247432
Thought he was asleep first.	479.2525251099133
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	647.9646985504869
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	304.06435964336754
Verdict: overdose.	1070.8811989568667
Death by misadventure.	836.8803857226223
The letter.	129.87428986177133
For my son Leopold.	404.83416340023
No more pain.	369.3858997741513
Wake no more.	458.20301691267355
Nobody owns.	1101.3106049509342
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	2128.8079491482463
Over the stones.	282.12170470959904
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	292.86885778303997
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	241.54584266908853
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	685.1858570691055
The Gordon Bennett.	613.1731662479676
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	227.70986980184787
That will be worth seeing, faith.	531.5369164652243
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	1375.5358945115115
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	2119.6643324083634
Kay ee double ell wy.	6767.95513615643
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	671.2040083994444
He left me on my ownio.	419.9174975499644
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	2135.6996599689865
Eccles street.	286.48155328469227
My house down there.	282.24594440271824
Big place.	314.06668710440874
Ward for incurables there.	699.5711740125205
Deadhouse handy underneath.	3219.2269381622937
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	848.2932650500536
They look terrible the women.	376.99670883913655
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	808.824351620517
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	384.5714679212661
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	880.453038408711
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	347.75812026417464
From one extreme to the other.	273.54517628308565
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	779.0014302746962
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	2428.8934561237797
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	2032.4122421916577
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	323.26293927895335
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	961.59229023379
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	263.99310899500347
Tomorrow is killing day.	980.9120394281692
Springers.	412.94388766377165
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	2089.760461394055
For Liverpool probably.	805.3422438207061
Roastbeef for old England.	724.1109668132243
They buy up all the juicy ones.	614.3388073098943
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	645.7284319863463
Comes to a big thing in a year.	303.42973086924957
Dead meat trade.	1115.4722702968816
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	1012.476398254426
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	2006.937069860967
The carriage moved on through the drove.	419.56262717856947
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	466.39750125737294
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	817.1847389628932
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	627.4472924847537
Quite right.	282.77850634473674
They ought to.	165.16058329935413
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	682.4332573002387
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	344.4109939167793
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	225.88073625927416
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	2271.3655626604177
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	594.121255415398
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	247.96427543745534
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	1419.5614550862151
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	234.25200351038524
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	579.3650570308405
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	393.2177854519454
Gordon Bennett cup.	1185.589438038354
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	743.2582661346669
Bom! Upset.	1355.3368114497446
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	363.1513694359772
Burst open.	582.2470928987304
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	754.9153419155301
Red face: grey now.	431.73632593514213
Mouth fallen open.	915.5029355022748
Asking what ’ s up now.	303.5212961417963
Quite right to close it.	359.60607366030354
Looks horrid open.	1051.6367160064215
Then the insides decompose quickly.	1074.761019920217
Much better to close up all the orifices.	780.6969880015539
Yes, also.	130.19157965221336
With wax.	332.4245563769551
The sphincter loose.	735.4785999156273
Seal up all.	332.2076173444763
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	475.4496464140035
Dunphy ’ s corner.	303.58308841371763
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	1885.8585448760357
A pause by the wayside.	565.5876479989643
Tiptop position for a pub.	745.1461457375945
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	588.6639343453093
Pass round the consolation.	563.0443753909442
But suppose now it did happen.	505.71554746657785
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	878.1024738231376
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	169.7927702990708
Depends on where.	387.59611476307384
The circulation stops.	623.9371619168667
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	1084.1937170430376
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	450.12228009669116
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	1546.745495925995
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	1313.8571568983555
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	956.0110257811893
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	2048.461485171786
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	962.7814666987327
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	833.6399439239528
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	534.0557530977728
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	2862.5112159210908
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	702.4740381518711
Or cycle down.	608.3147828297508
Hire some old crock, safety.	1362.0482720806688
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	364.3309409069826
Developing waterways.	1822.5318937766035
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	1126.6078608809078
Cheaper transit.	1532.5605361623102
By easy stages.	1265.3193577914544
Houseboats.	412.94388766377165
Camping out.	401.5186416439801
Also hearses.	851.3738632039496
To heaven by water.	380.9500936584413
Perhaps I will without writing.	569.5556517649153
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	590.0166229936673
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	1095.223027712009
With turf from the midland bogs.	1254.2251409647863
Salute.	286.319300185858
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	955.0527313104714
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	1498.2210333769037
Near it now.	233.62714934761658
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	599.4323290511079
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	516.5843819172434
— How is that?	167.2907451773669
Martin Cunningham said.	241.8911764651346
Left him weeping, I suppose?	618.7627312377618
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	381.8050081314023
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	1361.8716132236625
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	320.4967973586831
Last lap.	586.1006922948383
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	1066.6979914855085
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	951.1038144562533
In white silence: appealing.	683.33909158589
The best obtainable.	516.368636502554
Thos.	412.94388766377165
H.	134.40797648581974
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	2194.8192260487467
Passed.	412.94388766377165
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	1328.6243283417627
After life ’ s journey.	403.69585347514766
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	999.6635250655464
Mr Power pointed.	402.60014162709246
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	347.9492555505775
The last house.	191.3373703363559
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	167.1593381372509
A gruesome case.	542.1363768151168
Seymour Bushe got him off.	726.3087596560807
Murdered his brother.	528.3674713707167
Or so they said.	204.89341533272156
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	370.25621266914493
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	754.6390544562655
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	178.3500462633646
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	1949.6321184289523
They looked.	172.4334393664288
Murderer ’ s ground.	353.6721883274206
It passed darkly.	613.1362792136961
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	1559.2248782553854
Whole place gone to hell.	738.6940234420966
Wrongfully condemned.	1532.5605361623102
Murder.	260.138348246505
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	295.4842101631507
They love reading about it.	352.5070865962043
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	343.161054196464
Her clothing consisted of.	768.8658246484503
Recent outrage.	1449.406267364912
Murderer is still at large.	585.8028160330521
Clues.	412.94388766377165
A shoelace.	432.4394399146262
The body to be exhumed.	420.3735028985662
Murder will out.	371.1799316472723
Cramped in this carriage.	590.032604717583
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	506.60592236885236
Must be careful about women.	619.5255101883503
Catch them once with their pants down.	796.6421271064675
Never forgive you after.	475.0074908538293
Fifteen.	227.25177915691472
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	1558.386752438267
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	1517.8729467123812
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	2137.0178232479784
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	1295.7840083617941
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	593.9553992271026
He stepped out.	211.91890703897337
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	329.3478223414986
Change that soap now.	585.0895421716218
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	1214.723015602599
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	527.0606783886174
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	1450.2846482933114
It ’ s all the same.	116.04704920735405
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	1598.154764904331
Pomp of death.	412.45529811322734
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	1239.0796538296813
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	813.4412476823524
Dogbiscuits.	412.94388766377165
Who ate them?	511.5293503361631
Mourners coming out.	517.2393033550869
He followed his companions.	368.9117306540889
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	667.4313119461099
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	788.7249043820599
He handed one to the boy.	197.51163964066808
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	486.9051410049161
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	2769.9352936860246
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	1036.941660256315
Coffin now.	497.2282962903468
Got here before us, dead as he is.	322.2738477319967
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	976.936360298074
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	1015.039618354559
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	801.4456041006983
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	1834.67958311053
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	827.6436736693374
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	1069.2792011783235
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	1376.4722597311209
Too many in the world.	238.52404982671942
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	463.3393965849039
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	1259.9184019920335
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	472.6646675422366
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	650.5614070696233
So much dead weight.	652.9418618560883
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	1359.927552921774
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	296.60097297286364
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	572.4727520324894
Who is that beside them?	347.16277294550645
Ah, the brother - in - law.	276.34938570358236
All walked after.	272.1912940730347
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	687.5824638148298
— What?	121.21994813499828
Mr Power whispered.	397.4368926093088
How so?	236.69296649053763
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	724.4176810925829
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	437.86178408077143
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	384.83898866963995
Anniversary.	412.94388766377165
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	395.74092213753977
First I heard of it.	173.45796290883104
Poisoned himself?	1016.3775928614288
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	714.8622676228903
Speaking.	286.319300185858
— Was he insured?	556.1473758405064
Mr Bloom asked.	153.57621075409475
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	290.38258305622537
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	862.1721519821823
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	792.6464899366752
— How many children did he leave?	644.5490775724825
— Five.	159.46466725330774
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	341.1665306267061
Five young children.	563.5257323882236
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	430.57732777754495
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	461.89108616456076
Has the laugh at him now.	280.29767546597463
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	502.3775734518214
She had outlived him.	377.2425011354391
Lost her husband.	513.7551257845881
More dead for her than for me.	325.46346567748213
One must outlive the other.	545.5513437117057
Wise men say.	559.5719206164008
There are more women than men in the world.	372.4749992686422
Condole with her.	285.7601299937632
Your terrible loss.	1086.837522477703
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	410.58313814461815
For Hindu widows only.	1698.38400483011
She would marry another.	542.4418344910925
Him?	350.8969999903226
No. Yet who knows after.	361.36791994846305
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	673.1032516932685
Drawn on a guncarriage.	765.6729538455936
Victoria and Albert.	443.0518745435337
Frogmore memorial mourning.	2749.584411983781
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	451.8523421483246
Vain in her heart of hearts.	441.4987462218412
All for a shadow.	181.47642074196827
Consort not even a king.	602.6325224949986
Her son was the substance.	333.75547063119944
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	441.6475801326065
It never comes.	292.4926360829666
— How are you, Simon?	241.13190645689485
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	746.2736086829264
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	571.298213987917
— Never better.	240.72641220024303
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	485.7751430673045
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	635.8958314966347
Same old six and eightpence.	634.5520206771793
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	1435.2133443923785
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	392.8364804759018
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	618.6106593217057
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	645.3688148593283
Dick Tivy bald?	2942.013175904777
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	591.569941019253
A few bob a skull.	506.8086011118022
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	677.3211386700094
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	296.3087023180094
Is that the eldest boy in front?	539.7822090269759
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	211.2752970966656
John Henry Menton is behind.	525.8101430385061
He put down his name for a quid.	264.2201806864611
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	277.7290668695451
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	600.7422940269001
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	269.51279666736855
— How did he lose it?	353.33062575933235
Ned Lambert asked.	413.3871669963992
Liquor, what?	389.2010007822452
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	336.7545817644655
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	469.24154180489785
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	1067.6776632237318
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	462.8159696316339
Both unconscious.	867.2942842182118
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	487.6083909130293
All he might have done.	301.81285911135376
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	677.76537750864
Would he understand?	504.9983267376769
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	709.4786282700743
Which end is his head?	470.99825700809066
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	439.48935916868015
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	1505.8618697455986
Always in front of us.	276.61342192396876
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	918.4535431744214
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	756.6820726869338
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	863.8258946736679
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	893.0804529814563
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	644.9138544656386
Who ’ ll read the book?	335.6574482505913
I, said the rook.	139.29916107086768
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	619.6180318241803
Father Coffey.	486.78198620368966
I knew his name was like a coffin.	237.85616240668284
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	862.8982404629977
Bosses the show.	393.0029098071036
Muscular christian.	1120.4710166696884
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	1679.4231478021472
Thou art Peter.	956.4336421197459
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	952.4553849959523
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	579.0427035602979
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	1958.7568316574016
Hhhn: burst sideways.	1134.4854323912712
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	2413.6773519405942
Requiem mass.	959.8189034037268
Crape weepers.	1822.5318937766035
Blackedged notepaper.	1532.5605361623102
Your name on the altarlist.	447.59915677489784
Chilly place this.	683.8333394151565
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	610.3711855715908
Eyes of a toad too.	432.6082354778374
What swells him up that way?	428.6326137256078
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	1620.4636796744617
Air of the place maybe.	474.20387819916965
Looks full up of bad gas.	677.8738947847136
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	839.1820365698029
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	912.039210283968
Who was telling me?	355.42993324293457
Mervyn Browne.	1532.5605361623102
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	936.7773931015117
Out it rushes: blue.	492.84276757448737
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	382.9973366431206
My kneecap is hurting me.	1271.8133274769182
Ow. That ’ s better.	216.66126982132295
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	366.3502122159062
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	312.5004638750789
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	257.41362938303956
As you were before you rested.	443.9064020710284
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	223.81556342682887
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	1758.2707085590177
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	544.2924843098277
Up to fifteen or so.	419.2610318194567
After that, of course...	74.56904146166116
Holy water that was, I expect.	299.08397719719017
Shaking sleep out of it.	343.8896269654474
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	628.5943636276526
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	430.84156231916046
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	1672.2086587247384
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	486.2253302145613
On Dignam now.	315.4537704788239
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	548.697976091421
Says that over everybody.	620.2201752750464
Tiresome kind of a job.	408.101286150447
But he has to say something.	229.65906254859547
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	468.4049926819384
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	689.1388610062844
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	496.16930281161757
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	602.1490389890234
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	645.1834142340493
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	689.9568042165542
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	1729.9100686531929
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	860.6391254947364
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	484.7249901065074
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	310.6671676949196
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	538.9433741258538
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	181.56418287296367
But his heart is buried in Rome.	479.429412905457
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	689.6800402970817
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	457.4244422797385
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	1142.001492489474
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	604.1439100303693
Mr Power took his arm.	361.41486643598546
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	244.0287529038217
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	353.995866464025
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	306.7526912352141
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	1289.2635906478072
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	1109.391931468263
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	668.8968864332098
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	438.7563468840956
I suppose we can do so too.	338.60174643050334
We are the last.	156.68983122200973
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	950.5723010177836
They covered their heads.	548.4827220214611
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	531.2161346036914
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	798.3424769768894
Mason, I think: not sure.	321.3755259621319
Beside him again.	335.10734317964466
We are the last.	156.68983122200973
In the same boat.	267.1165237499977
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	485.5585124565893
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	1018.3745130204373
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	936.7265681319471
The language of course was another thing.	315.3153019588866
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	732.3203594713272
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	586.5852658069514
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	173.3501159418024
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	710.9973217686343
No touching that.	237.26725170246044
Seat of the affections.	419.1165473197665
Broken heart.	574.9032895324389
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	921.5661773623269
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	571.4550859461361
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	1053.6559688306234
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	1113.6236926094393
The resurrection and the life.	214.51549237600372
Once you are dead you are dead.	459.46991332015665
That last day idea.	393.35545363468594
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	541.8032201141631
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	611.7326657247978
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	819.7837729632155
Find damn all of himself that morning.	474.14507576631365
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	646.1701963986802
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	2886.040038999691
Troy measure.	672.3210316399184
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	951.7732628098339
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	477.8222912549496
What?	116.16450681686501
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	431.3764014939591
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	348.2020052086689
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	754.541051429764
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	275.67072002983184
— What?	121.21994813499828
Corny Kelleher said.	345.11553825488977
Mr Kernan assured him.	469.24859467729686
John Henry Menton asked.	570.0445293552973
I know his face.	125.31289031151071
Ned Lambert glanced back.	679.8219989642145
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	250.0298788414387
She ’ s his wife.	126.32689598160803
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	252.8968867708804
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	327.2888723624129
She was a finelooking woman.	335.049375911989
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	872.3199226525452
And a good armful she was.	314.24963570838014
He looked behind through the others.	305.9256209343825
— What is he?	134.06009243892115
he asked.	81.11898566253105
What does he do?	285.6131979907268
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	627.6922453961693
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	416.72000295312324
Ned Lambert smiled.	555.0994861522285
A traveller for blottingpaper.	580.3227735048607
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	493.071375935513
She had plenty of game in her then.	360.19267696786966
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	388.9199365562825
He does some canvassing for ads.	779.3916561219299
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	955.3044211672401
The barrow turned into a side lane.	626.7834081979514
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	895.5483895777633
The gravediggers touched their caps.	926.9462813230305
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	391.46560484384696
He never forgets a friend.	427.87009023695424
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	504.9275837882973
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	433.5722170349162
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	454.577964417126
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	360.5358996302322
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	1072.932815879909
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	387.3404203792525
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	199.8060770277733
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	1017.7974232296257
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	1096.682961114077
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	488.60589836089963
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	565.5979428131164
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	839.0935869885418
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	882.1376720208283
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	718.9406203417926
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	632.6865476875342
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	526.6100191905571
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	933.1992675759051
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	1008.9978173516697
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	424.6472836014954
— I know, Hynes said.	144.96756905405667
I know that.	80.53333668849345
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	393.33930830818025
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	628.7176174080673
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	740.5109209969944
All want to be on good terms with him.	324.8307749488523
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	624.3497673487445
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	705.1350326470966
No passout checks.	1702.113514645627
_Habeas corpus_.	2167.3678953985213
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	346.36694207591336
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	1057.01741452916
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	478.83153619665063
Be the better of a shave.	270.8982248716494
Grey sprouting beard.	2352.3576153789745
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	397.16278057161674
And temper getting cross.	902.2730399526325
Silver threads among the grey.	1079.6467001700605
Fancy being his wife.	482.134927917798
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	587.2276809438968
Come out and live in the graveyard.	309.3539650154026
Dangle that before her.	377.4417782447828
It might thrill her first.	529.5325082564854
Courting death.	736.4907898286557
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	817.8274258153654
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	976.5874179262412
Will o ’ the wisp.	512.1860527457285
Gas of graves.	645.314081323416
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	484.2901954920622
Women especially are so touchy.	1388.2586180703684
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	508.11958326802437
Have you ever seen a ghost?	608.6707070438703
Well, I have.	97.16921162250618
It was a pitchdark night.	373.9517204883151
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	338.41996359423365
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	954.7432040570011
Learn anything if taken young.	960.6622525642241
You might pick up a young widow here.	616.4731594020253
Men like that.	245.57341491235675
Love among the tombstones.	679.2523035605379
Romeo.	327.7537808406544
Spice of pleasure.	498.7805843864696
In the midst of death we are in life.	345.3445835146511
Both ends meet.	961.288884816267
Tantalising for the poor dead.	415.71929564647377
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	1021.3536587106776
Gnawing their vitals.	1284.9557219515332
Desire to grig people.	1242.6824099039957
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	335.6969341677755
Eight children he has anyway.	896.5999833520008
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	780.4477524495247
Holy fields.	595.0513831931229
More room if they buried them standing.	901.1596041882593
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	641.4053528899974
Standing?	701.7939999806459
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	815.777377993715
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	1344.281546225835
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	4596.320118841259
Well, so it is.	119.56585962113913
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	405.1137621918376
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	4225.837995204112
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	1042.7779474921304
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	435.12898176528034
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	1048.7261720688837
Every man his price.	460.25769727595707
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	1658.6009736363103
A bargain.	243.17856770616314
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	1737.265607636631
With thanks.	294.8656020243667
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	795.1086146768564
Charnelhouses.	412.94388766377165
Dreadful.	286.319300185858
Turning green and pink decomposing.	1470.9741109582128
Rot quick in damp earth.	1335.6284258503706
The lean old ones tougher.	1371.715210435758
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	480.77108886335463
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	785.5206052290105
Then dried up.	434.6352076895488
Deathmoths.	412.94388766377165
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	807.2255729238985
Changing about.	348.4393427830835
Live for ever practically.	804.5778427878034
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	664.8914841020945
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	652.3647579477325
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	1045.2319718738852
Your head it simply swurls.	884.1094123433214
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	2286.387084650333
He looks cheerful enough over it.	649.9539583346905
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	674.8421523734028
Wonder how he looks at life.	478.29604657716
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	852.4492076570979
The one about the bulletin.	284.7689274905017
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	553.8448442648142
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	232.559124196192
Not arrived yet.	1012.1418784002473
Peter.	143.15965009292913
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	531.8583105405999
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	869.7423516436972
Keep out the damp.	324.7997516395498
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	599.4393888678646
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	586.8954535366698
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	697.9471437020578
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	661.9632860959262
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	16546.117894808667
Go out of mourning first.	363.62093250897345
Hard to imagine his funeral.	512.4906779362072
Seems a sort of a joke.	353.1144592728822
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	1660.8623729178805
Gives you second wind.	676.5034563914734
New lease of life.	585.2582971293946
— How many have you for tomorrow?	443.87430971970514
the caretaker asked.	201.44274414851762
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	303.4577899959656
Half ten and eleven.	477.64575132804066
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	362.35501828594687
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	979.4310145411184
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	697.5527212063167
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	835.9530543727739
Burying him.	266.37273405361816
We come to bury Cæsar.	857.8502036962534
His ides of March or June.	1061.1854103946132
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	536.4124327268102
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	998.2243729104911
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	276.55798567691636
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	362.57162868034555
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	843.913802643156
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	537.3464214423435
Yes, he could.	98.38445665696445
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	730.3099700304786
We all do.	163.3522132754623
Only man buries.	704.3192269068942
No, ants too.	336.235891988802
First thing strikes anybody.	1225.726208095841
Bury the dead.	303.35982844728784
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	1059.4309407575777
Well then Friday buried him.	668.6420084273581
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	762.6494254043911
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	906.6818030138411
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	523.0374243735416
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	540.7393363283682
All gnawed through.	620.5593937757621
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	759.9127347555101
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	484.42253506912687
They ’ re so particular.	343.6569089825069
Lay me in my native earth.	657.2286519144014
Bit of clay from the holy land.	531.7038616061836
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	717.6117975902222
I see what it means.	211.01149556244914
I see.	67.86952710487904
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	530.551692413424
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	316.73157065122416
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	1110.3564276663362
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	441.4204029187648
Twelve.	227.25177915691472
I ’ m thirteen.	230.6916089660944
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	334.1005370821363
Death ’ s number.	305.6140086994323
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	514.6936670341532
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	274.50785113802004
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	1218.0982140620843
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	1144.013985496539
Tinge of purple.	561.7785369990206
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	513.6749938525247
Dressy fellow he was once.	506.0288281764376
Used to change three suits in the day.	577.9561945996959
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	855.9300767262766
Hello.	131.45299260355975
It ’ s dyed.	237.22726457874515
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	672.5388912731763
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	961.8605025427256
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	404.7869750832169
Twenty.	198.52271484804842
Pause.	412.94388766377165
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	815.9492652737347
Far away a donkey brayed.	1622.993217710846
Rain.	286.319300185858
No such ass.	490.3457468760899
Never see a dead one, they say.	260.4766099689818
Shame of death.	312.5826641476018
They hide.	279.80599213276963
Also poor papa went away.	927.6567508345549
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	1416.4073794321093
Whisper.	241.4910504830898
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	930.2960652527963
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	1079.4842759447788
Wellcut frockcoat.	1384.824771129642
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	691.771952105998
Well, it is a long rest.	186.1647996456258
Feel no more.	341.73819783518974
It ’ s the moment you feel.	173.3254652315494
Must be damned unpleasant.	926.9752709749738
Can ’ t believe it at first.	294.0785560719893
Mistake must be: someone else.	802.3069287779458
Try the house opposite.	384.9273419609245
Wait, I wanted to.	139.28418107220875
I haven ’ t yet.	283.4790280654379
Then darkened deathchamber.	1515.845168436374
Light they want.	372.13302677923787
Whispering around you.	481.2199221328538
Would you like to see a priest?	347.36758972107117
Then rambling and wandering.	635.7810048989294
Delirium all you hid all your life.	698.7274906915397
His sleep is not natural.	396.9420609469379
Press his lower eyelid.	1279.0393105954824
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	1037.7042855676857
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	665.184201399557
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	517.1037522576685
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	477.8045404745635
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	4097.432623171133
Bam! He expires.	1031.3283854666986
Gone at last.	311.1580921388451
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	459.6885677927517
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	320.65119453821603
Remember him in your prayers.	411.7813612397555
Even Parnell.	506.22992782474523
Ivy day dying out.	843.0332062039311
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	416.58699546232214
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	446.55721814239416
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	385.35472490770724
Nice change of air.	369.853260526994
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	460.0244657417575
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	565.513106500325
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	370.8988861839644
Someone walking over it.	424.9361922679102
Near you.	179.80439028431252
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	818.7562715267533
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	558.4929698565213
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	911.380574915876
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	275.5989267235846
And if he was alive all the time?	269.1540543750834
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	433.73449696486466
Of course he is dead.	302.2998699031468
Monday he died.	326.36180846499605
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	823.4194227811508
Flag of distress.	978.11324366434
Three days.	286.65671787479994
Rather long to keep them in summer.	486.7977203772706
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	424.9228740420608
The clay fell softer.	957.9970747034976
Begin to be forgotten.	435.6369800237778
Out of sight, out of mind.	225.55208411201855
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	634.6347131346591
Had enough of it.	211.3228962203394
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	706.413808124309
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	808.2454912210081
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	663.1110939616408
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	884.3369373980725
Ah, the names.	137.90136679115713
But he knows them all.	214.7204082394747
No: coming to me.	159.0467832821017
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	480.0287642836579
What is your christian name?	516.5463348650028
I ’ m not sure.	179.50825020214137
Leopold.	101.17069604185623
He asked me to.	116.64118626115479
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	423.83650229060777
I know.	71.18216054872103
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	584.1291463271921
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	1005.8391673825721
Find out what they imagine they know.	608.0598666371426
He died of a Tuesday.	245.5302589644115
Got the run.	209.5360574896622
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	564.7335053984078
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	340.859658398713
That was why he asked me to.	208.7342041347616
O well, does no harm.	351.44959039560524
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	165.59560922591083
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	574.0502905039829
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	1392.5710206915078
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	167.96696475523078
He looked around.	251.9393672381356
— Macintosh.	313.82481808628836
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	140.8795693326872
Where is he now?	228.61527191988267
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	516.4932761044356
I don ’ t know who he is.	187.28663255927782
Is that his name?	240.478237079481
He moved away, looking about him.	270.3940547608307
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	294.42081487828074
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	319.1277525647579
What?	116.16450681686501
Where has he disappeared to?	435.22018968723995
Not a sign.	212.88804692449705
Well of all the.	77.16780301607311
Has anybody here seen?	1274.9261951517105
Kay ee double ell.	3571.556132242748
Become invisible.	1141.4234690418218
Good Lord, what became of him?	375.6400453518268
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	1773.1271199299342
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	600.3788272048772
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	374.6633143209556
It rose.	191.17457142154404
Nearly over.	404.7759321766121
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	1087.9039294608492
All uncovered again for a few instants.	840.8643468246117
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	594.012205802595
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	1387.6306048148856
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	901.5407895364674
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	1043.707379165791
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	1328.5117066547596
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	1478.419973483684
His navelcord.	414.57440446381617
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	499.74902346240765
Thanks in silence.	302.0798958230327
Sorry, sir: trouble.	359.72119107156396
Headshake.	412.94388766377165
I know that.	80.53333668849345
For yourselves just.	705.6293297988598
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	1478.3202560133282
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	384.4174119501762
— Let us, Mr Power said.	237.84701800419776
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	424.31072078200634
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	596.423452063357
That the coffin was filled with stones.	417.6988675230716
That one day he will come again.	331.5939915464546
Hynes shook his head.	423.4439473115029
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	288.81386289561334
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	143.80454753552766
Peace to his ashes.	417.9934531899469
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	1631.5832789308872
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	843.8792296125384
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	215.86056237811323
Does anybody really?	1713.777279386782
Plant him and have done with him.	333.6729025692151
Like down a coalshoot.	509.13995084733955
Then lump them together to save time.	665.0393396690212
All souls ’ day.	284.04405536028764
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	392.3365392293051
Ten shillings for the gardener.	494.05866076892977
He keeps it free of weeds.	499.93772812751865
Old man himself.	283.69116396030876
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	1766.721534438832
Near death ’ s door.	337.7367746981948
Who passed away.	312.86427865085284
Who departed this life.	581.6313158846585
As if they did it of their own accord.	438.1944794084816
Got the shove, all of them.	192.77559969367374
Who kicked the bucket.	437.574742737534
So and So, wheelwright.	322.8089697447371
I travelled for cork lino.	1089.9772068794277
I paid five shillings in the pound.	381.77712629614246
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	267.66305830463705
I cooked good Irish stew.	906.4884794538696
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	1156.0775677327701
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	809.3248874915032
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	594.1947890283727
The great physician called him home.	663.667893877729
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	273.7692113414174
Nice country residence.	859.0119422003854
Newly plastered and painted.	1402.4357100850664
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	1779.5981775737496
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	3034.9583285989
Better value that for the money.	314.18293644823467
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	418.4950192006061
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	1094.8119115124582
Expresses nothing.	726.9856914969259
Immortelles.	412.94388766377165
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	2572.1320429601788
Like stuffed.	534.6772367976931
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	511.7319443925841
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	789.9194396033882
Dead animal even sadder.	2077.352403439662
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	1226.2080608739907
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	462.0025152905819
Heart on his sleeve.	367.8443990774416
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	695.9375168089316
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	426.2517698616824
Seems anything but pleased.	897.8239994001741
Why this infliction?	1109.5401104344298
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	619.6190766188322
Apollo that was.	235.37691168817193
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	881.1836401900879
Besides how could you remember everybody?	1226.153709085431
Eyes, walk, voice.	240.29418215831177
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	218.50317488723758
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	439.58524695209223
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	835.557347253329
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	26394.12895302644
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	336.71291471288725
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	604.5032674082345
For instance who?	608.0868985743845
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	585.0156721211054
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	976.2444868902301
Wait.	107.93485186050891
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	1081.2686067773143
Some animal.	465.98417993165594
Wait.	107.93485186050891
There he goes.	203.92077415603302
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	1311.1098587384995
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	891.2108109033018
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	953.3078149696543
Good hidingplace for treasure.	1178.4217658504024
Who lives there?	511.4394585196386
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	1155.2753914112936
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	976.7316068482908
Making his rounds.	721.563895646189
Tail gone now.	763.1498232854038
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	585.4083134635126
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	651.8611542249099
Ordinary meat for them.	648.1774932353931
A corpse is meat gone bad.	802.7803687690852
Well and what ’ s cheese?	304.8523845725921
Corpse of milk.	363.5342358059157
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	702.6519154176194
Cremation better.	696.0664036432205
Priests dead against it.	588.8841470792188
Devilling for the other firm.	501.1679196350183
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	6975.241259003534
Time of the plague.	237.76500379078212
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	1306.3629106701628
Lethal chamber.	1120.4710166696884
Ashes to ashes.	596.0143173862814
Or bury at sea.	586.4637757467211
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	895.1509840981228
Eaten by birds.	738.6692748495472
Earth, fire, water.	306.9832703748179
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	627.8819254398591
See your whole life in a flash.	471.6876823267604
But being brought back to life no.	388.0054850235203
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	397.7525323579051
Out of a flying machine.	486.3137651538333
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	742.8697870212196
Underground communication.	1822.5318937766035
We learned that from them.	300.85550077090505
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	446.4745848376466
Regular square feed for them.	933.2445912668144
Got wind of Dignam.	367.26658440401974
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	291.4162500650498
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	2921.5819343577455
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	892.1457320267323
Back to the world again.	239.97335879217323
Enough of this place.	326.58739355661476
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	633.3425946593115
Poor papa too.	497.06949619912996
The love that kills.	310.2141989896802
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	1133.9903866781694
Give you the creeps after a bit.	354.2876838202373
I will appear to you after death.	324.2538893020937
You will see my ghost after death.	548.7542951422151
My ghost will haunt you after death.	996.7067553209662
There is another world after death named hell.	905.7522349391132
I do not like that other world she wrote.	326.4059981001799
No more do I.	179.0009144491999
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	467.99530339671134
Feel live warm beings near you.	1313.2510548415146
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	947.9102607266876
They are not going to get me this innings.	546.3489106355399
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	1968.2359201400982
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	1086.416409388411
Solicitor, I think.	267.5851184791656
I know his face.	125.31289031151071
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	804.5995832711235
Dignam used to be in his office.	259.9323857593674
Convivial evenings.	1251.3304378412884
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	1183.2540249095366
Heart of gold really.	434.1382589697843
Yes, Menton.	154.23333643429953
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	830.3685561392134
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	904.3017452509691
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	635.9083034806844
Hate at first sight.	644.0023865067707
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	1048.101235948299
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	649.8102685735411
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	285.27918048289496
Carriage probably.	950.8055212138433
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	274.82069763754373
They stopped.	237.29048614802744
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	426.6591052703497
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	976.90065005377
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	520.2367929013377
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	1082.8011372338144
He clapped the hat on his head again.	298.93975725701034
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	240.11423921454758
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	1072.3051713100988
— Thank you, he said shortly.	240.2692921214749
They walked on towards the gates.	369.3558978964873
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	717.9393926154941
Martin laying down the law.	454.2797584066884
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	586.9711660942263
Oyster eyes.	517.3625123075755
Never mind.	290.93432077485016
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	913.0460833290102
Get the pull over him that way.	319.3868250483957
Thank you.	157.64509390952867
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	2862.518706247567
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	1847.2139756969498
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	2566.2161526825194
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	1162.468819798944
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	3155.7244909577753
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	2987.3996704254337
— There it is, Red Murray said.	291.3482776456544
Alexander Keyes.	595.0513831931229
— Just cut it out, will you?	279.36762960673803
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	250.57006595060196
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	596.7004735357646
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	929.0290520351333
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	1314.6461371740181
Scissors and paste.	771.398117906554
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	343.10480550239697
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	571.3153381633284
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	242.09731914869977
I ’ ll rub that in.	192.86858335145885
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	1440.0867743379426
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	877.6179405761692
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	1053.1624552480466
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	1315.7234835769764
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	394.8057344317488
Welts of flesh behind on him.	457.1202045084398
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	539.6873844771959
— Don ’ t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	525.3704872689332
Red Murray whispered.	1106.9778378043943
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	892.473741158337
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	627.363254307927
Way in.	162.56151472259833
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	1172.908079149473
Mary, Martha.	214.0026472410635
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	1198.0447859332933
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	302.7047026515611
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	603.1451111297797
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	489.7963826102547
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	2296.9402243953614
Hand on his heart.	301.78828113648234
In <URL> Co - ome thou lost one, Co - ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	2722.4559568531236
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	617.9400036374109
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	726.5374041017927
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	948.0131337448711
But will he save the circulation?	513.1287659459781
Thumping.	286.319300185858
Thumping.	286.319300185858
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	1513.685585577796
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	1147.3940415442587

Working away, tearing away.	700.3631451032122
And that old grey rat tearing to get in.	528.3841133510739
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	4237.53391035073

— Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	373.8379898569218
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	1083.2656686210842
Long John is backing him, they say.	473.2881052569852
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	557.6968043733511
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	993.1310429614298
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	514.826734397887
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	189.63877704134478
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	584.4138002674684
— Did you?	195.1005978400262
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	241.30004576507102
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	394.092672422101
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	222.77311646866343
I ’ ll tap him too.	250.94972928718917
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	835.8356965900857
Three bob I lent him in Meagher ’ s.	531.2839060204338
Three weeks.	423.19012637540015
Third hint.	1288.724661018198
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	3031.340151735242
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	215.69898161646478
Keyes, you remember?	311.87402808037916
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	1079.570653308344
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	271.77372946606874
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	679.6387734033395
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	186.23480747105737
He wants it changed.	317.4355621482358
Keyes, you see.	156.5463493418189
He wants two keys at the top.	417.84380060290806
Hell of a racket they make.	539.5689472161355
He doesn ’ t hear it.	249.1822065511991
Nannan.	286.319300185858
Iron nerves.	950.8055212138433
Maybe he understands what I.	506.46261420368023
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	921.8106696856123
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	350.49416169871415
Let him take that in first.	230.77203681339606
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	805.3602899617182
Clank it.	268.6859286405824
Clank it.	268.6859286405824
Miles of it unreeled.	636.1243841100454
What becomes of it after?	289.342825030665
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	728.7363505077631
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	1601.640857029917
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	944.8311024280537
Two crossed keys here.	811.5381749184733
A circle.	209.94578984027444
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	800.5512798695698
So on.	104.22285003749764
Better not teach him his own business.	625.3476601657113
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	394.7619442856637
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	418.3302456147473
You see?	209.12877171777805
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	303.8566924304525
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	1163.1318234134521
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	181.96162011396467
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	521.0595410264382
Innuendo of home rule.	816.7614239110006
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	350.54837053273474
Catches the eye, you see.	220.6563276174229
Can you do that?	269.4674785574337
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	670.6956813917354
Better not.	167.48075251640913
— We can do that, the foreman said.	216.79122779323112
Have you the design?	337.08826584867677
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	154.71897181532984
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	272.5462718099739
He has a house there too.	207.43370983691625
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	281.3799900149063
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	493.90822876207415
Longfelt want.	646.9042430934185
So on.	104.22285003749764
The foreman thought for an instant.	525.9298756754926
— We can do that, he said.	151.78157867610344
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	642.7521357117867
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	1192.255901232637
He began to check it silently.	634.372548651985
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	1003.1708779266485
ORTHOGRAPHICAL Want to be sure of his spelling.	825.2916085919661

Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	438.65661018321146
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	476.8179709729958
Thank you.	157.64509390952867
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	377.79501785822634
No. I could have said.	127.94393229457752

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	985.4923469637007
— Monks, sir?	269.37344275233204
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	320.72313439561486
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	450.8849290056715
Time to get out.	216.928440860489
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	251.5072859790661
— Monks! — Yes, sir.	230.71155107295905
Three months ’ renewal.	684.3202738919638

Old Monks, the dayfather.	437.03655751810356
Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	1241.7990850515362
Nearing the end of his tether now.	507.6842371677723

AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.	4445.97714537541
Reads it backwards first.	1022.435888523449

And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher.	215.45523790070868
And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	610.3684234697052
Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.	660.3664615098634
Justice it means but it ’ s everybody eating everyone else.	993.1327772114781
That ’ s what life is after all.	207.3043108454841
Practice makes perfect.	1368.6269700022465
Seems to see with his fingers.	279.0713421456526
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	489.4855000138981
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	406.8732734082844
Better phone him up first.	587.477878097771
Number?	486.5967821582095

Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches?	1476.671299700406
Looks as if they did it for a bet.	369.1899227784941
Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works.	1128.6955651369424
Lukewarm glue in Thom ’ s next door when I was there.	750.5514606001758
He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose.	476.5396346362106
Citronlemon?	884.205033265537
Ah, the soap I put there.	207.76748934063667
Lose it out of that pocket.	286.04404567428907
Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	614.9860724972775
What perfume does your wife use?	1037.9291324117444
I could go home still: tram: something I forgot.	533.5864813941506
Just to see: before: dressing.	336.90111753942944
No. Here.	116.71618232631349
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	958.8667965152391
Know who that is.	231.00331342719127
What ’ s up?	133.8141326723907
Ned Lambert it is.	250.87534404670689
He entered softly.	405.12860964254406
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	3547.0434144033197
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	846.7107039989276
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	1537.7061684587777
What about that, Simon?	207.70404691382748
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	277.3072921479586
How ’ s that for high?	205.31785681596233
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	314.8760154557871
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	973.9118714945067
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	566.1790788476743
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	403.09706941502094
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	288.5113137636197
High falutin stuff.	1687.0481927206993
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	417.65279194005853
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	472.4787313836769
He has influence they say.	349.3095422336633
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	766.5441723494089
Close on ninety they say.	854.2206162294533

— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	606.8666648667604
— What is it?	140.8458157135941
Mr Bloom asked.	153.57621075409475
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	1489.5494499552965
_Our lovely land_.	2551.065429640428
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	8017.554190368605
Mr Bloom said simply.	208.21968450024752
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	772.653931757248
With an accent on the whose.	351.4744277740699
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	473.24239720549826
— Is it his speech last night?	444.8657751825489
Mr Bloom asked.	153.57621075409475
— But listen to this, he said.	176.38691694420658
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	379.6669921673418
— Excuse me, J.	195.8577658321992
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said, entering.	248.69560897576406
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	805.2543359194158
— I beg yours, he said.	220.8117584694603
— Good day, Jack.	220.35928702503986
— Come in.	94.57383492744601
Come in.	86.08842167802996
— Good day.	175.0623372351527

O ’ Molloy shook his head.	338.8374468244086
SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	1015.2237748945138
Decline, poor chap.	468.93216856697615
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	1784.6131356602218
Touch and go with him.	210.75637166179226
What ’ s in the wind, I wonder.	128.96709001520924
Money worry.	1218.8005344734222
— _Or again if we but climb the serried mountain <URL> — You ’ re looking extra.	1181.13624764348
— Is the editor to be seen?	325.86759005601715
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	408.8755106466682
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	425.6952878267751
To be seen and heard.	268.9793955361254
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	236.14433577813907
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	661.1542849673864
Practice dwindling.	1532.5605361623102
A mighthavebeen.	432.4394399146262
Losing heart.	683.6790823504459
Gambling.	412.94388766377165
Debts of honour.	542.7982253755005
Reaping the whirlwind.	768.0062210083048
Used to get good retainers from D.	1180.0359399386239
and T.	109.78576985707478
Fitzgerald.	241.4910504830898
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	713.8730197670089
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	834.6277326162538
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	1547.978062131703
Wellread fellow.	643.1099196708724
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	996.1499501208449
Weathercocks.	412.94388766377165
Hot and cold in the same breath.	334.12005775180467
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	338.5766927259429
One story good till you hear the next.	542.0973162788325
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	632.2552773459117
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	850.7529002703242
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	546.1961603395936
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	956.8485299802252
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	611.7442477106173
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	700.7098573386031
Is he taking anything for it?	395.36965802734755
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	1989.6242411240435
He forgot Hamlet.	400.99377860768504
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	466.9016602077585
Life is too short.	454.9159489896551
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	1126.107586089636
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	1219.9657447692814
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	1881.8887048653246
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	717.8952913572903
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	1926.0317190069234
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	321.9005290886049
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	1204.744371531743
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	1378.081534707214
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	1085.2378157865032
Hooked that nicely.	839.0836554378828
Entertainments.	327.7537808406544
Open house.	364.6523272845654
Big blowout.	884.8242381027072
Wetherup always said that.	347.4214730644265
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	362.9043620502874
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	1214.1083894721535
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	616.302668127228
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	1286.7205831284582
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	708.6558842362783
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	238.1970063825215
I must get a drink after that.	241.7230480261079
— Drink! the editor cried.	359.00660419899623
No drinks served before mass.	1243.1549174263766
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	270.52654910520084
Come on, Ned.	152.62729760218596
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	730.6710841110769
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	561.8912899397484
— Will you join us, Myles?	559.9222441591924
Ned Lambert asked.	413.3871669963992
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	2360.8964831506037
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	808.5471492214456
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	1054.0338143167908
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	587.9271949574697
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	491.70095917914284
Passing out he whispered to J.	444.31711668406683
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	788.7922740637235
Sad case.	391.8444264694712
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	1212.7217648063831
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	765.5504424414347
Long, short and long.	235.63844447400325
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	1255.6670567555525
— Bingbang, bangbang.	627.4534086180153
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	432.51013420724405
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	183.70197322946896
I just want to phone about an ad.	553.9623940470027
He went in.	94.79841425772189
— What about that leader this evening?	535.5435171888482
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	552.8230399696474
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	455.6021599398557
Never you fret.	638.8933813712332
Hello, Jack.	203.4480193082892
That ’ s all right.	137.98986440860082
— Good day, Myles, J.	211.50643616529092
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	657.9301193109656
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	1384.6603941754756
The telephone whirred inside.	1177.1623951188215
— Twentyeight...	87.0275524908396
Double four...	177.88032094324308
Yes.	72.08392493010007
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	1265.7714821367617
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	811.3530526020602
he asked.	81.11898566253105
Sceptre with O.	230.3144355061729
Madden up.	175.57678087086015
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	271.46349128570125
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	888.6502440821124
— Hush, Lenehan said.	261.1892434676135
I hear feetstoops.	461.7353223677621
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	972.786288231793
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	764.7358815733548
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	213.39580477405386
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	317.47026956040776
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	273.784532532895
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	444.7426288817411
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	763.1955095944822
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	409.0771055692549
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	575.5648408446438
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	755.4647212866878
— Him, sir.	164.0031314949485
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	439.57925085056337
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	405.226512511546
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	1105.3963529449406
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	681.2664529054664
Is the boss...?	115.5565519416552
Yes, _Telegraph_...	100.7742329391442
To where?	289.23203243787276
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	488.10677013450334
Aha! I see...	115.12720922634232
Right.	143.15965009292913
I ’ ll catch him.	181.16448339826323
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	1928.1141807406905
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	732.6793904237184
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	668.1628552664477
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	419.3370138556017
Are you hurt?	564.6915328597714
I ’ m in a hurry.	163.9698991473934
— Knee, Lenehan said.	288.3763047969885
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	1030.7940992653691
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	202.90834348440558
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	300.80390868997864
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	602.614717108894
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	936.3563451577363
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	470.2361211143763
Want to fix it up.	395.08258724794723
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	237.00672196880558
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	585.9337035469346
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	912.3605354303487
— Begone! he said.	225.95270652049163
The world is before you.	195.19491406620762
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	302.5333132072482
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	644.7924738955876
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	541.30821911386
Look at the young scamps after him.	477.65655791108185
— Show.	159.46466725330774
Where?	182.8914914813631
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	249.2945790968757
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	1296.118741345083
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	459.8958177396551
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	1013.0943500307021
Small nines.	1384.824771129642
Steal upon larks.	2234.9780142799013
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	1237.4556130375724
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	664.8220436413291
— What ’ s that?	114.48218109093882
Myles Crawford said with a start.	405.3899912414331
Where are the other two gone?	381.92037697904397
— Who?	160.92060442380037
the professor said, turning.	144.02764809068017
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	417.7456872506556
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	1094.5211637426657
Came over last night.	584.9105014393601
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	290.80879075386935
Where ’ s my hat?	242.60476240940673
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	710.4250781142824
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	665.3790672835221
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	332.7904970297583
— Seems to be, J.	175.3919542223429
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	528.4485364139807
Who has the most matches?	569.8494998971494
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	1033.0801256414566
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	916.6352815688749
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	451.0022356176527
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	811.828215566622
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	634.7060283544471
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	1983.4662076375669
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	789.7074412494012
— Eh?	259.4949541985836
You bloody old Roman empire?	1122.229501649907
Myles Crawford said.	324.10454279345817
He took a cigarette from the open case.	330.7640308937648
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	819.987534171737
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said gently.	289.760442341114
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	2545.00909548644
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	516.5708197228282
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	1741.348018845417
— That ’ s it, he said.	87.60468987451584
We are the fat.	192.05927002359758
You and I are the fat in the fire.	157.70984979421252
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	536.3503323050157
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	2231.9826638881095
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	582.6603341561937
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	822.8235803740621
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	2467.216517344463
Vast, I allow: but vile.	692.2405118871144
Cloacae: sewers.	1230.1194716390055
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	538.4773416328742
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	1435.230912160792
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	828.3422233405782
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	459.49939012923625
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	735.0992490828295
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	656.5326161516135
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	268.49579786082666
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy murmured.	359.13197984575964
But we have also Roman law.	708.7142960204982
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	1814.4436924419877
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	1536.5278565293795
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy asked.	222.04716938341383
Everything was going swimmingly...	356.8936652193264
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	364.40793817753433
Are you ready?	525.8124728771496
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	754.1514370271841
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	340.36203239169527
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	1047.4089389256437
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	5488.852720791169
— How do you do?	271.7873717061897
the editor said, holding out a hand.	194.68327344322577
Come in.	86.08842167802996
Your governor is just gone.	797.7951467056965
???	83.06798269329575
Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	964.2863985460363
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	1043.0406593554978
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	736.1111667648775
— Who?	160.92060442380037
the editor asked.	164.21473700998033
Bit torn off.	840.2289796006227
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	327.2504686164368
— That old pelters, the editor said.	324.64947240078754
Who tore it?	489.9309987036004
Was he short taken?	717.5134543302192
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	1680.4749939486142
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	326.9534545523151
Foot and mouth?	411.95905332055077
Are you turned...?	109.85703271010475
Bullockbefriending bard.	1083.6839476992607
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	2026.5146610729876
The letter is not mine.	299.13984440645135
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	245.86523736874193
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	215.20192223547858
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	1430.0477729388804
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	540.7766034048922
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	740.1406907379204
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	719.3247451198744
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	424.5466983304523
— Is he a widower?	318.6624367343041
Stephen asked.	127.73918192616229
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	455.51493397090604
Emperor ’ s horses.	374.8108797713414
Habsburg.	412.94388766377165
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	939.414015051197
Don ’ t you forget! Maximilian Karl O ’ Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	1807.4099452598032
Going to be trouble there one day.	456.772223513755
Wild geese.	979.2189864208775
O yes, every time.	201.17369213283183
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	450.10016432403137
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	828.1788820757024
Saving princes is a thank you job.	1031.0819267266127
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	503.62150248613824
— And if not?	194.3003084739364
he said.	50.91883309542916
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	332.88903221946066
A Hungarian it was one day...	163.05065787741472
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	2693.538019479457
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	328.5729307226386
We were never loyal to the successful.	493.6553139560364
We serve them.	407.9103645820234
I teach the blatant Latin language.	896.3389568222406
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	559.8188351356813
Material domination.	1822.5318937766035
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	751.4699859320028
Lord Jesus?	535.8247268623363
Lord Salisbury?	1312.4971723788904
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	1513.1982864275385
— The Greek! he said again.	218.4551502486844
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	1047.9498924980392
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	551.9226941323564
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	336.72014049058373
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	1345.3967512930537
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	1078.6552995517156
They went under.	243.82760473714697
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	1253.0744213274488
Loyal to a lost cause.	495.0534858454827
He strode away from them towards the window.	419.26572779311516
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	691.5619392438796
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	774.9850942130917
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	738.2449989494216
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	1594.0210967862768
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	2279.649195157584
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	304.62741012525163
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	517.340105590493
Whose mother is beastly dead.	1035.3702948957052
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	1042.4334721304026
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	163.3516477733803
I ’ ll read the rest after.	215.29383758555593
That ’ ll be all right.	213.7854910791709
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	649.7060674974106
— But my riddle! he said.	253.9733519423836
What opera is like a railwayline?	680.7952241975127
— Opera?	422.0884103782564
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	907.2336596189746
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	1629.870688854805
See the wheeze?	482.7940423599473
Rows of cast steel.	813.3545294014575
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	1158.539646842722
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	805.1884911392062
— Help! he sighed.	473.46867930279325
I feel a strong weakness.	445.60529100115264
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	888.4735514571545
— Paris, past and present, he said.	176.13830498988133
You look like communards.	644.9562351472986
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	640.6777433088128
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	423.7419753738132
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	729.934821967034
You look as though you had done the deed.	423.813295947325
General Bobrikoff.	1251.3304378412884
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	743.5213729963592
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	411.24184607285434
Law, the classics...	153.0033498930354
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	231.4487531188005
— Literature, the press.	255.13520668133208
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	207.5851505965646
The gentle art of advertisement.	486.5905369249527
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	483.62241438402657
The vocal muse.	877.4318422642525
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	481.83950107931395
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	683.8723068637697
— Ahem! he said very softly.	469.3025549012555
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	306.1846974420202
The gate was open.	273.79447636539976
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	2661.4859558348026
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	185.49511064119363
Something with a bite in it.	224.34533186287194
You can do it.	188.0920079235934
I see it in your face.	147.56118214837514
_In the lexicon of youth_...	391.7608897107779
See it in your face.	204.42787743831585
See it in your eye.	227.05124730577066
Lazy idle little schemer.	2668.5930756562047
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	1087.8888584084086
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	2340.093110711286
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	683.9427710284376
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	487.42945661556365
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	1124.5894078307974
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	876.0318928433076
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	782.2214610663218
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	269.3238362981891
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said.	162.78555399086
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	1226.2832996667898
Wait a minute.	275.29522448195223
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	1104.7857054777319
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	241.02039908580974
That was a pen.	194.91285911732854
You know how he made his mark?	517.3362911570515
I ’ ll tell you.	143.1463686132054
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	922.9854273244963
I ’ ll show you.	161.2160952299899
He pushed past them to the files.	416.49120451196666
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	2171.192099400801
Remember that time?	345.40373416362746
Professor MacHugh nodded.	1133.473053181798
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	1196.843491202006
Where it took place.	285.0548638467188
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	895.329633629395
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	245.69167249472574
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	778.5220978457014
Whole route, see?	770.0983006627691
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	478.4637261094207
Fitzharris.	286.319300185858
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	445.02850662772164
Holohan told me.	429.31883004322356
You know Holohan?	710.7020835975895
— Hop and carry one, is it?	337.5502026947824
Myles Crawford said.	324.10454279345817
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	501.1872777452049
A night watchman.	419.45292877342706
Stephen turned in surprise.	282.6809366360793
— Gumley?	341.5145657130533
he said.	50.91883309542916
You don ’ t say so?	337.809216361523
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	1290.6905544782783
Look at here.	235.47796760061908
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	1118.2106543512532
I ’ ll tell you.	143.1463686132054
Inspiration of genius.	595.0492197788845
Cabled right away.	724.2010708526145
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	1760.6070411962473
Right.	143.15965009292913
Have you got that?	306.72101997182125
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	512.5779932918136
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	750.6455421301483
Have you got that?	306.72101997182125
Right.	143.15965009292913
The telephone whirred.	784.523182262478
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	343.2764897819717
— B is parkgate.	456.5313209367341
Good.	96.64799330511264
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	1354.5905384091684
— T is viceregal lodge.	708.6586719851825
C is where murder took place.	664.2700318474532
K is Knockmaroon gate.	1293.8562767429767
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	630.6737709431718
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	1515.890661225273
— Hello?	235.4199796174984
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	289.7593004935437
Hello?...	64.90177570438382

Yes...	38.43574925812318
Yes.	72.08392493010007
— F to P is the route Skin - the - Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	1369.9087238406216
<URL>. Got that?	197.99090139177508
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	1118.1020926036426
The professor came to the inner door.	321.67734357187067
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	145.5860577553384
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	379.7981965651341
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	582.302261254724
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	747.5431959953212
Very.	139.390526815372
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	500.9217784641076
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	857.4423911901313
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	252.835573724139
I was present.	121.62844494834289
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	684.8057339300448
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	508.7056700077774
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	1067.9439323018303
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	715.1763580099571
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	431.6024474262342
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	550.351196042607
Out of an advertisement.	339.574622352308
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	802.492190499908
That gave him the leg up.	248.71153641316718
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <URL> Now he ’ s got in with Blumenfeld.	1016.7551384536907
That ’ s press.	178.58834763833266
That ’ s talent.	296.6354161872019
Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	885.9787001047
— Hello?...	72.26783931733297
Are you there?...	90.58995081116397
Yes, he ’ s here still.	144.4371063300705
Come across yourself.	521.412556414735
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	493.0639851131368
the editor cried.	194.39477617814774
He flung the pages down.	309.07137822231306
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	706.9156581263746
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	454.5744474874408
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	804.6614383191578
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	355.959331835068
— O yes, J.	142.45587942387297
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	356.2943562340839
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	862.4539381811626
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin - the - Goat.	972.5637519831283
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! — They ’ re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	732.7578078119401
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	871.4057855844364
Eh?	320.48906629443826
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	732.2555915596159
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	2415.03301095068
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	973.0678899080641
Why did you write it then?	412.7317021947042
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	2880.0437214108497
Is the mouth south someway?	858.4315018545119
Or the south a mouth?	338.41100507731807
Must be some.	215.62411523113755
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	438.7608381594823

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, _per l ’ aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più <URL> But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.	1588.4665533144228

— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	625.2366532583255
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	1198.7599070116044
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	1496.1673168559907
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly ’ s Budget_, _Pue ’ s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	2152.979085906737
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	1449.4235649269028
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	581.1714535819992

Psha! — Well, J.	303.5621981861683
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said, Bushe <URL>., for example.	243.00542220350852
— Bushe?	305.02509421165735
the editor said.	113.14018221840993
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	254.85751151905103
He has a strain of it in his blood.	217.69153409143019
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	1730.402028433074
— He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....	185.2707055876458
But no matter.	257.5081195234032
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	608.94410578483
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	458.745422552797
Bushe defended him.	735.4328298860296
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	678.5409262839144
He died in his sleep.	219.20436788194849
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	692.6856703307297
— What was that?	128.15791237401373
the professor asked.	136.49980186037638
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	784.3537200755298
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	1096.2697502538883
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	539.8200174402954
— Ha. — A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	785.0791304615656
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	442.9656268727904
False lull.	1822.5318937766035
Something quite ordinary.	923.3288855799398
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	1492.4929760224795
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	747.9346769786397
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	1610.2437875902806
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	1134.4300318948478
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	549.0275302229934
— The divine afflatus, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	589.1591077051789
— You like it?	167.02742740258122
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy asked Stephen.	260.3709654414337
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	671.8301053102391
He took a cigarette from the case.	256.47442438878113
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	575.3624508317943
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: — Muchibus thankibus.	1293.6745757787755
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	1450.6815790158453
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	174.46941864463832
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	899.0855175651739
E.	132.89764665905037
the mastermystic?	359.7042112689708
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	484.22407909355076
A.	48.14463764461572
E.	132.89764665905037
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	792.5527815228088
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	1053.8193571923498
E. ’ s leg.	164.92708382645836
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	448.73911438014113
Speaking about me.	350.11791141224234
What did he say?	247.56422641496826
What did he say?	247.56422641496826
What did he say about me?	291.1259293837883
Don ’ t ask.	263.328960852191
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	546.3913186768531
Wait a moment.	191.92895548306535
Let me say one thing.	330.54192263186775
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	1442.6687490411784
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	881.4979665427903
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	721.2452917570982
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	497.1591371965024
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	521.2683330213946
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	714.4358944698831
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	326.0959036884174
Go on.	146.27525922882882
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	855.8843364206583
It was then a new movement.	308.5024295364346
We were weak, therefore worthless.	1047.893325915963
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	1090.370585071608
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	2285.154229654165
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	380.5253078370757
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	572.8398801902548
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	958.1676216669309
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	691.0172305130385
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	657.7842193091151
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	339.9376506908843
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	1735.0594801659447
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	1035.2153989448525
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	433.040206803805
He raised his head firmly.	485.6351070145866
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	1083.025839158717
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	2502.3731550448856
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	721.6633098183345
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	1034.359847242912
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	2175.223551544589
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	666.6287837498703
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	517.7287566335829
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	1444.2023394347934
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	502.13016358036117
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	963.3679609739019
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	947.220974513067
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	2048.6117165794894
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	1110.0997693740962
Child, man, effigy.	365.0849608699655
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	1176.8696850089054
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	1566.154325918091
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	806.7202992747578
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	1840.8186336866377
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	725.6459320988769
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	747.1803133028058
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	1725.2919684204674
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	713.9330737350068
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	675.6806698858347
And with a great future behind him.	313.77120927410203
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	1087.7586056304733
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	472.31484760302834
Gone with the wind.	214.91380214499813
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	961.147323918346
Miles of ears of porches.	667.8861444929562
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	635.162630496338
A people sheltered within his voice.	751.0509783823304
Dead noise.	529.8380310733073
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	1197.1161659150882
Love and laud him: me no more.	443.7930581431117
I have money.	132.63245738026484
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	190.05005676241268
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	1122.5812842189011
— You take my breath away.	376.6494079189457
It is not perchance a French compliment?	1042.2413250727175
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	414.0722696825057
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	1161.6259559050445
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	771.9492802242581
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	647.5843724232136
The contrary no.	302.3012527781395
I declare it carried.	372.84189700793155
To which particular boosing shed...?	514.0016245873633
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	1088.0324455213597
Yes, we will not.	166.72366842157322
By no manner of means.	442.60914936594577
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	689.6747638266145
Let us go.	296.7162325989699
Where are those blasted keys?	1311.6990119508316
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	994.0305331295116
— Foot and mouth.	234.54530397894047
I know.	71.18216054872103
That ’ ll be all right.	213.7854910791709
That ’ ll go in.	161.74196719557617
Where are they?	279.01362072699993
That ’ s all right.	137.98986440860082
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	521.2266357625897
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	353.7574483631268
Myles, one moment.	201.53529934006514
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	424.9930435677282
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	166.75728906274645
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	309.226253868191
It has the prophetic vision.	624.1343870906669
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	1822.9077943448015
Kingdoms of this world.	420.13323835028655
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	868.4326276604011
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	979.4799144368523
I have much, much to learn.	217.8423786880469
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	439.6627154041368
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	185.2089395143494
— Yes?	150.01831352624413
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	361.9611412748977
Crawford will follow.	488.51548381672774
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	3221.21424429645
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	894.1907293910936
— Where is that?	173.37248777154
the professor asked.	136.49980186037638
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	387.67816773013874
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	2827.0643199985734
Against the wall.	309.55595795592546
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	5058.333904402929
Frantic hearts.	1141.4234690418218
Akasic records.	1532.5605361623102
Quicker, darlint! On now.	788.0016146405347
Dare it.	319.5232180404939
Let there be life.	269.35491102443706
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	371.94177062515405
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	1515.567196148334
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	859.9178669421103
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	407.860732831858
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	865.9152244468487
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	672.085257659326
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	2311.1056781286584
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	742.4727391589457
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	840.1425658311213
Glory be to God.	294.05989111968023
They had no idea it was that high.	293.857356105296
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	2960.372936874675
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	1321.6211981371127
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	1801.4119166415367
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	518.7082392789068
Vestal virgins.	1190.102766386246
I can see them.	156.76213512695287
What ’ s keeping our friend?	482.0422322288109
He turned.	109.90153679972754
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	1444.1787981896912
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	821.6774886962621
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy.	146.92422621728508
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	362.52802686366005
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	340.83472286391543
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	412.5620414827295
I see them.	100.45433215912374
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	1054.140296936914
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	482.88149933487097
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	951.587294185765
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	417.7782015064262
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	336.03187945069254
After he ’ ll see.	203.64928292254876
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	556.2366084731422
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	897.344996178573
I can have access to it in the national library.	373.4664911431002
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	362.2995496839533
His name is Keyes.	358.707991941739
It ’ s a play on the name.	151.4900039508573
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	629.3696325298619
But he wants just a little puff.	479.8557404972955
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	302.5302214824662
<URL>. — Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	512.0808886696104
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	944.3607745070592
Tell him that straight from the stable.	439.36081141906743
Look out for squalls.	581.960064282275
All off for a drink.	217.08052624438642
Arm in arm.	500.0415185183166
Lenehan ’ s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	869.7718008177322
Usual blarney.	1532.5605361623102
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	425.2924819402035
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	458.8226677438318
Been walking in muck somewhere.	1494.7314246691146
What was he doing in Irishtown?	400.563881302471
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	374.3370203145324
He ’ d give the ad, I think.	213.2325740911144
I ’ ll tell him...	87.69020202481039
<URL>. — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	859.265762895714
Any time he likes, tell him.	370.0927122583004
RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	944.7393412989569
I ’ m up to here.	140.83730654237155
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	510.1659279256813
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	490.7575411879544
Sorry, Jack.	306.41767050134337
You must take the will for the deed.	293.3964280226765
With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.	441.0805526785649

O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	496.4688155103152
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	526.1453779983407
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	616.3580206821373
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	390.7894683924239
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	498.8380689865874
SOME COLUMN! — THAT ’ S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID — That ’ s new, Myles Crawford said.	2038.2320384041718
That ’ s copy.	209.7529143260644
Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	677.8635585770861
Two old trickies, what?	563.1006551558833
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	433.33344295310405
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	1064.42356173606
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	3234.5208311143747
No poetic licence.	1153.370693370326
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	347.23729596179356
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	885.9390256616279
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	719.1853774948214
I like that.	68.95256480573612
I see the idea.	119.97230841215965
I see what you mean.	198.91559005008864
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	1519.0881843749987
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	805.8073416634928
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	666.0338289261429
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	565.1550064759051
— Finished?	555.4995880672506
Myles Crawford said.	324.10454279345817
So long as they do no worse.	460.84140704330275
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	5860.809325035524
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	469.9676628050485
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	645.6279624605023
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	233.55695976089143
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	703.7084248401959
Poor Penelope.	526.5773345085337

WHAT? — AND LIKEWISE — WHERE?	2221.51160838871
— But what do you call it?	302.5762930259391
Myles Crawford asked.	470.41414654808074
Where did they get the plums?	497.22247155107453
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.	2275.508085948601
SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.	15069.844757066057

Call it, let me see.	243.55265741997331
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	1495.7397766665263
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	767.5366642855481
He laughed richly.	517.7860198324365
— I see, he said again with new pleasure.	212.80903102102064

He halted on sir John Gray ’ s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.	1572.2021704366662
DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS.	37307.9602893821

That tickles me, I must say.	353.54887179134187

They wheeled lower.	728.9365665724639
Looking for grub.	687.7077587042686
Wait.	107.93485186050891

Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com.	3843.2363931853174
Not a bit.	154.99198639771163

They wheeled, flapping.	504.6982924922937
The hungry famished gull Flaps o ’ er the waters dull.	2666.605828191525
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	648.3349377244239
But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse.	1349.547174053785

Those poor birds.	664.6493697061579
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.	1284.4730166857084
See that?	206.66678664234735
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey.	1025.5951798010144

Our staple food.	1202.5165260674787
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	515.6445582192191
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	1035.9961949097274
Doesn ’ t bring in any business either.	693.712882794462
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	1375.5322259188783
I bet that would have caught on.	360.2260150741535
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	1078.94176012496
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	474.2420376663648

Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	404.97056296957123
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	561.7299158918146

Sweet name too: caramel.	829.1043523842746
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	233.75281958175185
If she had married she would have changed.	542.7221134554547
I suppose they really were short of money.	421.9250470400374
Fried everything in the best butter all the same.	489.57464656145993

Seeing her home after practice.	912.5394987094696
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	1361.8227009648185
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	1198.9920002916792
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin ’ s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	1102.0949740367566
He and I behind.	95.17510279261326
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	820.2731347463998
Lucky it didn ’ t.	352.3698178425996
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	414.219459605147

She did get flushed in the wind.	351.41576414907047
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	1420.79884867398
And the mulled rum.	560.1684388577967
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	708.1978166187305
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	891.5949811041384

— O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	206.63295401985783
— O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	308.5473817460253
— No use complaining.	694.7524622894574
How is Molly those times?	596.813912615627
Haven ’ t seen her for ages.	521.3429862162436
— In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	273.4036705079029
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	384.2302443210358
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	484.0510187428247
— Yes.	84.75158391348033
In a photographer ’ s there.	265.726470504404
Getting on like a house on fire.	392.2022148222911
How are all your charges?	803.7038295652677
— All on the baker ’ s list, Mrs Breen said.	375.7241647485916
— You ’ re in black, I see.	163.42751937148086
You have no...	79.15131607847042
— No, Mr Bloom said.	121.50117658025843
I have just come from a funeral.	269.06025388846007
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	543.7611474226733
Who ’ s dead, when and what did he die of?	241.2464485395136
Turn up like a bad penny.	515.665016980282
— O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	229.76215930861576
I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	610.2166879408179
May as well get her sympathy.	623.2937618062251
— Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	141.13737857116882
An old friend of mine.	391.4321554427594
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	507.3242108197142
Heart trouble, I believe.	342.9710513993848
Funeral was this morning.	456.4499975092516
Your funeral ’ s tomorrow While you ’ re coming through the rye.	773.8590422661457
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	873.2268167408236
— Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen ’ s womaneyes said melancholily.	817.7918448013031
Now that ’ s quite enough about that.	279.6136605647517
Just: quietly: husband.	408.45551616842124
— And your lord and master?	356.51023563265517
Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	588.3958575450721
— O, don ’ t be talking! she said.	210.6603044961623
He ’ s a caution to rattlesnakes.	318.28632813306854
He ’ s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	460.44073289420896
He has me heartscalded.	448.677437512266
Wait till I show you.	323.9951359560561
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison ’ s.	3321.1361892725818
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom ’ s gullet.	734.7845532680026
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they ’ d taste it with the hot tea.	782.2890791119446
Or is it from her?	218.20574747583944
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	991.903511617055
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	893.4966863642086
Pleasure or pain is it?	714.5718673366883
Penny dinner.	663.2945412320329
Knife and fork chained to the table.	663.8673015982721

Pastille that was fell.	462.94011356531087
What is she?...	68.86490516072284
— There must be a new moon out, she said.	269.51620774588724
He ’ s always bad then.	209.54395485225854
Do you know what he did last night?	451.44685089815084
Her hand ceased to rummage.	797.6898207910174
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	713.9306373221211
— What?	121.21994813499828
Mr Bloom asked.	153.57621075409475
Let her speak.	271.24843617379975
Look straight in her eyes.	318.52134758967406
I believe you.	117.27366600941751
Trust me.	334.8123800348041
— Woke me up in the night, she said.	210.40300282989003
Dream he had, a nightmare.	325.3901176355213
Indiges.	412.94388766377165
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	596.7846952919613
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	356.58324416632195
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	817.8607858423067
— Read that, she said.	153.35136522392875
He got it this morning.	240.97610520430422
— What is it?	140.8458157135941
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	238.2353667742409
U.	157.56758319468753
P.?	115.56542578860665
— U.	152.3593669384406
p: up, she said.	159.16784266760038
Someone taking a rise out of him.	384.7723968400307
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	336.8138947053966
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	200.28879622759192
She took back the card, sighing.	342.11908517971085
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	270.3624851717574
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	412.9312371879836
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	880.7433904328957
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	1441.7115854074661
Seen its best days.	915.9619245050377
Wispish hair over her ears.	836.3914515709852
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	708.6058928266406
Shabby genteel.	2167.3678953985213
She used to be a tasty dresser.	573.1469289494735
Lines round her mouth.	548.3752240631428
Only a year or so older than Molly.	719.3080002025056
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	296.7054164665164
Cruel.	260.138348246505
The unfair sex.	892.8347872555994

Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	9028.817984099973
I ’ m hungry too.	275.01165515606743

— Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	599.7820982965283
Mr Bloom asked.	153.57621075409475
— Mina Purefoy?	601.1761698660862
she said.	70.04603019478795
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	568.2223165168549
Playgoers ’ Club.	769.6669067561127
Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.	870.3154789568547
Did I pull the chain?	533.4636528938346
Yes.	72.08392493010007
The last act.	257.99489448289467
— Yes.	84.75158391348033

She ’ s in the lying - in hospital in Holles street.	329.6005680722421
Dr Horne got her in.	400.87835679314253
She ’ s three days bad now.	348.8138643709231
— O, Mr Bloom said.	110.2641125031978
I ’ m sorry to hear that.	234.092592041892
— Yes, Mrs Breen said.	228.80794189792678
And a houseful of kids at home.	564.4506458744901
It ’ s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.	344.95355759409875
— O, Mr Bloom said.	110.2641125031978
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	2526.3364837967233
His tongue clacked in compassion.	978.3852367473603
Dth! Dth! — I ’ m sorry to hear that, he said.	382.9299672048657

Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: — Mind! Let this man pass.	929.4682191027896
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	1411.91746677762
Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head.	987.4076453671533
— Watch him, Mr Bloom said.	180.70285786171226
He always walks outside the lampposts.	761.7428053980929

Ay. He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.	718.7669084140358
— Ay, he said, sighing.	165.66194009380413
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	383.68811857543926

The sky.	185.0058518210901
Green by Drumleck.	782.4161065708778
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	1978.6574879284587
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	1262.3325069403427
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	881.8150150931166
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	908.7126762559295
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	692.3482402473153
Yum.	412.94388766377165
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.	785.9278509821572
Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.	2698.9228596549374

A goat.	328.5829183303205
No - one.	184.4742532433252
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	3104.2159522162797
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	778.0308433078177
Hot I tongued her.	623.4488310417778
She kissed me.	251.6941851877648
All yielding she tossed my hair.	952.6115765664156
Kissed, she kissed me.	429.81037131737895
Me. And me now.	191.48196438986758
Stuck, the flies buzzed.	656.4504096744364
His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.	1583.560634681371
Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty.	752.747303689273
Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires.	1321.7103539147754

Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian.	2510.2785553231993
Immortal lovely.	766.2802680811551

I ’ ll look today.	224.2897702006116
Bend down let something fall see if she.	882.3436726247721
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	627.3883450453189
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	617.0979473142828
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	523.1182443103229
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	394.49674974771136
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	246.86618795043964
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	401.71846403875037
Is he in trouble?	299.55473009250824
— Trouble?	467.11761228066587
Nosey Flynn said.	361.4585298568544
Not that I heard of.	139.78394196000596
Why?	184.539251337404
— Was he?	195.18239298488717
Nosey Flynn said.	361.4585298568544
So he was, faith.	164.4848987390949
I asked him how was all at home.	244.82881531749632
You ’ re right, by God.	203.06484992012128
So he was.	104.44093278346568
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	548.4323297512304
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	655.6958059612335
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	294.902087186509
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	662.4902218142236
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	288.0684134167965
Plovers on toast.	874.8157198259737
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	391.29919299062857
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	1165.8576819011082
You can make bacon of that.	343.2128652636648
— How so?	212.40438851066082
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	459.81292782311243
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	1213.1490060480612
He winked.	235.73110014376988
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	122.70952478451245
— Do you tell me so?	324.0552064026311
Davy Byrne said.	380.29223835375086
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	439.02393775467795
Ancient free and accepted order.	1257.317180568712
He ’ s an excellent brother.	299.13479542295437
Light, life and love, by God.	216.86177592633535
They give him a leg up.	282.65555425794946
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	208.21238405172969
— Is that a fact?	243.60275050048355
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	242.57881430771212
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	281.82896299011566
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	398.2463395045026
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	302.85322269217755
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	740.0206283879191
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	655.0978665281317
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	531.5827562258652
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	664.7070482618177
Decent quiet man he is.	433.6340510535738
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	289.24461839807236
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	903.728559406498
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	1070.6913491209325
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	420.8548395359849
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	265.49837448075795
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	589.2024201269666
Declare to God he does.	364.5770402831794
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	335.55669640718094
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	322.2148461330123
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	328.9944559690698
Give the devil his due.	349.93855418413995
O, Bloom has his good points.	232.97251811262737
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	254.50383386630025
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	1947.9067786397882
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	238.67208333495526
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	368.98139308149865
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	748.4446110086935
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	1270.3393476383073
— Day, Mr Byrne.	264.2621379232692
— Day, gentlemen.	242.50904450074412
They paused at the counter.	423.9397778503099
— Who ’ s standing?	239.54658073196214
Paddy Leonard asked.	601.6553323487921
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	511.7414932177256
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	195.39659712741746
Paddy Leonard asked.	601.6553323487921
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	480.55529302401146
— How much?	268.0579705167776
Paddy Leonard cried.	712.2299484072751
Since when, for God ’ sake?	439.6649660497065
What ’ s yours, Tom?	286.03126270765443
— How is the main drainage?	686.591163943098
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	701.1985730899513
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	1255.1600131837524
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	489.26028870480684
he said.	50.91883309542916
— Certainly, sir.	184.0872909069714
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	1652.1497910942173
— Lord love a duck, he said.	219.23925317189628
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	1322.0424567747077
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	621.1091549903855
A dead snip.	637.5952201197903
— Zinfandel is it?	308.41847284540387
Nosey Flynn asked.	524.6307391115295
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	1345.879784527806
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	656.6172984578885
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	601.7659016997552
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	884.8035771188856
— Is it Zinfandel?	490.8027377210653
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	1201.0200000254615
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	564.5926118632713
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	574.9309179628727
Who gave it to you?	221.65483358062255
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	512.3560609045385
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	455.08556361291556
The others turned.	242.9983347038804
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	962.3796960599077
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	290.1845277456863
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	2102.667125259378
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	358.3556179509046
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	981.3141198756957
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	399.7109496304096
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	1287.4390646063703
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	2570.591050316267
Surfeit.	412.94388766377165
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	2389.758674823538
First sweet then savoury.	970.0252920379377
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	918.1353315165985
Ruminants.	412.94388766377165
Their upper jaw they move.	1391.3559205178383
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	777.0913760191731
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn ’ s mouth.	640.369771807344
Lean people long mouths.	1482.0599012413159
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	740.9756387669808
Course then you ’ d have all the cranks pestering.	755.554760992528
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M ’ invitasti.	1531.656442676119
Feel better.	366.5766807825771
Burgundy.	286.319300185858
Good pick me up.	366.0252644596003
Who distilled first?	1163.7172825796345
Some chap in the blues.	512.725155852414
Dutch courage.	979.2189864208775
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	898.1952867819438
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	1190.5268825694359
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	1900.746795256923
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	726.8042662069769
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	1814.2815401977732
Tonight perhaps.	649.497097632833
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	1549.6862666335362
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	559.9472582014118
That ’ ll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight.	831.4213981507357
Three Hynes owes me.	987.2226700369478
Two eleven.	323.8544760022229
Prescott ’ s dyeworks van over there.	816.5040348923316
If I get Billy Prescott ’ s ad: two fifteen.	910.9674556611456
Five guineas about.	598.8016414539137
On the pig ’ s back.	213.8966299080651
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	820.0077927479676
Today.	241.4910504830898
Not think.	199.75231832232342
Tour the south then.	507.1689618917044
What about English wateringplaces?	1252.829611117505
Brighton, Margate.	560.6148258520783
Piers by moonlight.	974.679951608854
Her voice floating out.	509.17237671975283
Those lovely seaside girls.	1169.3406269914667
Against John Long ’ s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	2354.013237963225
Handy man wants job.	1073.1644515016242
Small wages.	1646.843470859384
Will eat anything.	571.8781176068221
Mr Bloom turned at Gray ’ s confectioner ’ s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan ’ s bookstore.	1287.2157056339686
_Why I left the church of Rome?	649.8548298086026
Birds ’ <URL> Women run him.	677.0340865236986
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	815.7861660399027
Same bait.	897.5587947883248
No tram in sight.	385.012823189273
Wants to cross.	409.89632171589693
— Do you want to cross?	382.46640627272734
Mr Bloom asked.	153.57621075409475
The blind stripling did not answer.	658.9838322594478
His wallface frowned weakly.	2618.466636493219
He moved his head uncertainly.	459.5859757942018
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	259.7504099313243
Molesworth street is opposite.	684.7795846547438
Do you want to cross?	442.5403819659451
There ’ s nothing in the way.	146.69701176683097
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	483.0071532103911
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	705.1315897584374
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	473.50546944861037
Horse drooping.	979.2189864208775
Driver in John Long ’ s.	432.0007346812543
Slaking his drouth.	782.5156759437344
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	219.27255672719258
I ’ ll see you across.	199.27923663969557
— Yes, the stripling answered.	208.3758078606079
South Frederick street.	710.3942797914756
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	137.68405668691398
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	1000.2835860380299
Say something to him.	213.52817326522643
Better not do the condescending.	474.99190700617567
They mistrust what you tell them.	582.0109650183141
Pass a common remark.	812.328510933605
— The rain kept off.	398.2350376827958
No answer.	211.0033432680533
Stains on his coat.	491.6887902568385
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	402.9262862468599
Tastes all different for him.	408.1715083019241
Have to be spoonfed first.	560.8780825683306
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	186.34316129502886
Like Milly ’ s was.	204.07506668813772
Sensitive.	327.7537808406544
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	653.0335472400018
Wonder if he has a name.	252.44131571630655
Van.	327.7537808406544
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	978.5867761344512
That ’ s right.	122.36024235768144
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	359.6701405474295
— Thanks, sir.	156.7360587571481
Knows I ’ m a man.	233.30959538518155
Voice.	412.94388766377165
— Right now?	321.67313210800916
First turn to the left.	240.9122011850635
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	670.5886879757923
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	1258.938720963936
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	642.839363417552
Must have felt it.	278.0948658192579
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	677.7915903507657
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	623.5852374851578
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	497.04475318997
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	501.7889858812195
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	689.4477551702468
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	570.76530464069
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	334.9703700487391
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	367.1183062507507
Read with their fingers.	375.40424434841134
Tune pianos.	1822.5318937766035
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	860.2051284693964
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	1178.4737304637788
Of course the other senses are more.	506.90441722492693
Embroider.	412.94388766377165
Plait baskets.	1822.5318937766035
People ought to help.	539.7030215963426
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	730.2369581515604
Hates sewing.	2167.3678953985213
Might take an objection.	872.9103078930348
Dark men they call them.	546.7412265200985
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	1176.5337645170334
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	931.0978900256833
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	305.9219841810245
Tastes?	613.073528652238
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	566.105944916034
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	589.2755933727965
And with a woman, for instance.	165.24008578527202
More shameless not seeing.	1289.7754184777657
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	507.3522110659678
Look at me.	177.72113067150187
I have them all on.	115.65299022044061
Must be strange not to see her.	316.9673942988625
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	262.47960029574824
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	513.5834965197743
His hands on her hair, for instance.	279.9608422195792
Say it was black, for instance.	277.47391150018825
Good.	96.64799330511264
We call it black.	285.92886731383703
Then passing over her white skin.	565.2565130801678
Different feel perhaps.	843.628325215176
Feeling of white.	315.14516009364485
Postoffice.	286.319300185858
Fag today.	772.3865696785816
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	743.5349093453624
Accept my little present.	720.0524552946409
Stationer ’ s just here too.	433.84045911159836
Wait.	107.93485186050891
Think over it.	245.0171897958743
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	1046.9506787740452
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	574.0581446989498
Downy hair there too.	659.1866461316487
Not smooth enough.	652.218168748955
The belly is the smoothest.	359.0353963373971
No - one about.	226.25904314460465
There he goes into Frederick street.	579.3907775306221
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	1282.5317254684753
Might be settling my braces.	1269.6963401144342
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	924.6461452621385
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	396.793891143592
Want to try in the dark to see.	236.94161390098256
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	397.75290718332434
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	491.0533368737244
Terrible.	227.25177915691472
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	458.5577162427027
Life a dream for him.	305.9625445809837
Where is the justice being born that way?	509.56388304660453
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	2166.6377124750984
Holocaust.	412.94388766377165
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	1292.1216151811875
Dear, dear, dear.	250.47906238355475
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	515.2392316938721
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	1471.1424257639308
Solemn as Troy.	816.9026551978826
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	1152.5258221534764
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	2716.0998414163855
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	927.7020081455191
I sentenced him to ten years.	450.04056806807773
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	428.2137639661599
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	748.0648591718551
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	533.6183677662091
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	6011.159561694454
Sends them to the rightabout.	508.41870895902196
The devil on moneylenders.	575.228099633864
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	1573.7006257571397
Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	473.8037679397913
Power those judges have.	605.674327775995
Crusty old topers in wigs.	1797.2087382024745
Bear with a sore paw.	864.2225379130307
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	486.675227952282
Hello, placard.	427.57296501917983
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	654.8750280235284
Sixteenth.	412.94388766377165
Today it is.	219.46945671527942
In aid of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital.	795.836542439121
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	600.9420415389043
Yes.	72.08392493010007
Handel.	327.7537808406544
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	424.31120671684215
No use sticking to him like a leech.	589.2927279813102
Wear out my welcome.	783.2311348991435
Sure to know someone on the gate.	381.8390895819254
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	333.38828844290805
First I must.	229.43909782581463
Library.	260.138348246505
Straw hat in sunlight.	794.5433107403047
Tan shoes.	872.9447086487241
Turnedup trousers.	846.3802527508003
It is.	88.52918458182057
It is.	88.52918458182057
His heart quopped softly.	1206.0383128868245
To the right.	111.75736153155471
Museum.	327.7537808406544
Goddesses.	412.94388766377165
He swerved to the right.	197.69866951024125
Is it?	189.71082127678855
Almost certain.	537.6896221041155
Wine in my face.	283.92940707055743
Why did I?	232.07122715645622
Too heady.	942.2000613132266
Yes, it is.	80.48732413270882
The walk.	136.71903425318388
Not see.	155.11673504444607
Get on.	143.4877870038344
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	963.2333570352826
Handsome building.	1101.3106049509342
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	3240.3350796564973
Not following me?	502.4263712668558
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	365.5405088162749
Light in his eyes.	193.75372506636995
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	719.2578784447394
Quick.	191.6715737888812
Cold statues: quiet there.	798.9972092984771
Safe in a minute.	309.45431284531924
No. Didn ’ t see me.	220.30060226339833
After two.	193.62334689743875
Just at the gate.	218.40057465562398
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	1514.0998379800346
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	1796.7571430762137
Look for something I.	206.60781331615877
Where did I?	230.8256924552681
Busy looking.	688.8523067737834
He thrust back quick Agendath.	827.8093592158336
Afternoon she said.	327.57617387423926
I am looking for that.	169.7531830387214
Yes, that.	62.99677012736194
Try all pockets.	462.18142554472985
Handker.	412.94388766377165
Trousers.	241.4910504830898
Potato.	286.319300185858
Purse.	412.94388766377165
Where?	182.8914914813631
Hurry.	227.25177915691472
Walk quietly.	522.0877745279364
Moment more.	446.7403651171962
My heart.	210.15890012482288
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	1019.1517655619161
Ah soap there I yes.	408.12164186202943
Gate.	286.319300185858
Safe! Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred: — And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	1088.0549188635507
A great poet on a great brother poet.	609.1158272311081
A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.	1338.4927092421517
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	1246.6531799730558
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.	1775.8077043155029
— Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.	513.8549865824864
The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts.	2617.1767043859154
One always feels that Goethe ’ s judgments are so true.	1185.9092658091442
True in the larger analysis.	816.6268884002577
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off.	2176.1599065653604
Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant ’ s words: heard them: and was gone.	456.65455316319606
Two left.	220.57452941320952
— Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.	1509.0283406537078
— Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with elder ’ s gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation?	1802.0320468540299
_The Sorrows of Satan_ he calls it.	980.1291516668293
Smile.	327.7537808406544

He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	378.1757294780294
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	1081.342552337387
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	1601.8929281122216
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	464.7095401044277

From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	956.8162742328911
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	785.2253218290458

_Hamlet ou_...	327.5709188034779
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	597.3482863282674
John Eglinton laughed.	487.4314694279185
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	144.63168302576173
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	1291.1063853110425
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	1694.6318320406517
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	549.741769316869

— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	520.5379889273205
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	1069.2468659271701
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	1783.1988599442432
If thou didst ever...	373.7743127573186
— What is a ghost?	234.23420618277976
Stephen said with tingling energy.	600.6812618899768
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	1137.3528342885759

John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	1169.7847290555417
Lifted.	412.94388766377165

— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	828.821761547511
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	1164.737190445348

A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	737.317366826271
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	478.0592421562506
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	752.0443874747109
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	481.7368951358722
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	819.8804101528623
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	703.8999499009575
Art thou there, truepenny?	1222.6899611684855
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	646.199559512289
I mean, we have the plays.	214.0149047109442
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	751.1564973407044
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	1109.271668857596
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	647.8472587055724
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	628.5323688879023

John Eglinton ’ s carping voice asked.	638.4859943839906
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	803.3460462162457
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	402.06005563763296
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	601.4197238723846
She saw him into and out of the world.	171.38594149917446
She took his first embraces.	462.5555897785476

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	648.0349172681713
— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	336.87277380076864
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	610.5667981123419
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	770.1996796791087
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	1001.429333073213
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	1268.8480104114587
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	897.6832081891457
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	3715.6721923208097
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	460.92591137279715
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	737.1225590674098
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	1504.882844373515
Mr Best ’ s quiet voice said forgetfully.	649.4636303869618
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	602.910192135721
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	1401.4852661356617
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	438.78787906811203
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	1026.8018415278204

She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix.	477.3270381187344
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	2085.482812164545

Come! — Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	844.6054569827357
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	1450.6299152877302

Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses.	1098.519562414132

Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	1055.1478090857852
See this.	186.2188407940169

Stephen sat down.	250.04089167102225
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	832.9415484838648
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	771.4496756783709
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	545.7843955224167
Alarmed face asks me.	1018.5752009066662
Why did he come?	327.5131715166995
Courtesy or an inward light?	1564.552261240656
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	415.9788798554554

Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	1264.76505913177

And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	1041.4165582691091
— Yes.	84.75158391348033
So you think...	95.8775265736039
The door closed behind the outgoer.	649.8637831092534
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	2068.390541134353
A vestal ’ s lamp.	446.5477967461107
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	1054.5723302823285

— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	522.7505340183877
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	498.7739743276741
Not even so much.	369.38912920353033

A shadow hangs over all the rest.	465.1721081841431
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	479.47686572275944
Mr Best pleaded.	616.520042491634
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	259.17104734754344
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	313.71158912340377

Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	790.0722727288246
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	1327.7912657205081
Bear with me.	258.9665409228963
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	4119.962271419342
A basilisk.	363.63677483853303
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	7227.209691941397
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	872.2748792945545
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	828.9493943029628
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	686.5693354106692
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	435.4290701719481
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	401.17163474215846
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	1391.7928316791786
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	411.0175489235543
I feel Hamlet quite young.	510.17499930720624
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	690.4024183052422
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	815.6253312583765
He is in my father.	137.1603538739047
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	255.62795982570472
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	1600.8998936753808
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	429.42414297554853
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	1513.5654268551616
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	673.9756734790153
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	469.48624917106815
Said that.	219.53397178394724
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	717.0183924001615
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	1113.5554121156185
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	965.7249703847161
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	297.76421796970817
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	1351.7575595478033
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	927.4660678965018

How many miles to Dublin?	750.1094148541099
Three score and ten, sir.	395.8402541811781
Will we be there by candlelight?	873.934497974662
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	457.302531791439
— Does he?	272.3086110998315
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	887.5366819497101
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	368.2671140199119
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	319.58407023684
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	1336.8855402490246
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	631.2442930293985
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	843.8361345557441
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	482.1019725529097
Do you know what you are talking about?	469.6008206998287
Such an appeal will touch him.	875.639813089115
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	700.0292925206321
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	2059.0548861687116
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	458.38045436122235
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	1663.579372642661
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	2249.3863813313114
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	1749.8788276721948
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	1054.3631666970928
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	1692.9574033724884
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	1023.1487202786254
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	1369.1576158173132
Dost love, Miriam?	911.524362647439
Dost love thy man?	1222.1612119447277
— That may be too, Stephen said.	214.49239367132478
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	529.2490555093337
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	760.6563308425164
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	716.6716491205646
Why?	184.539251337404
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	795.7428302823863
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	1362.4462107590987
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	1636.1074729016389
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	1546.5759009716007
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	1072.1957579739542
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	540.5395477933869
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	1204.147602918351
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	367.3538706593314
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	904.6030293267528
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	1006.3380031106362
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	946.585092714536
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	759.6074432651636
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	1065.8104129046467
His beaver is up.	404.5213083627056
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	310.9811911700514
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	414.27052906180216
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	1375.3228065771984
_Entr ’ acte_.	1101.3695463179185
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	781.2608687398621
My telegram.	425.6869316019747
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	709.7657002526201
he asked of Stephen.	102.92722661543542
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	1535.6190988370886
They make him welcome.	370.6348719608317
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	8454.897469035743
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	1657.0549220600735
He lifts his hands.	259.63808139699665
Veils fall.	884.8242381027072
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	1088.9684531239614
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	290.1550939056691
A most instructive discussion.	845.5920879113215
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	285.09081969720756
All sides of life should be represented.	732.5566000347868
He smiled on all sides equally.	558.5883101416196
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	638.0465268988606
he said.	50.91883309542916
I seem to know the name.	195.0098551023602
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	1889.3773123011085
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	364.3911155658151
The chap that writes like Synge.	694.0301639772541
Mr Best turned to him.	226.6912758799151
— Haines missed you, he said.	210.50537047931294
Did you meet him?	395.5759233425086
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	219.4687779559772
B.	119.75576330508032
C.	96.23846299732125
He ’ s gone to Gill ’ s to buy Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	638.8631513720129
— I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	273.7239695358716
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	852.8999644279156
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	430.4050644783755
Has no - one made him out to be an Irishman?	599.0138507402295
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	874.2125218389979
— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	528.8501219614501
<URL> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	788.3384620801933
— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	489.34482228816387
the quaker librarian asked.	438.27566439851427
Or Hughie Wills?	3474.8318776964697
Mr William Himself.	512.2119098571925
W.	131.45299260355975
H.: who am I?	235.2153130671134
— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	732.6919984776013
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	456.83755707640785
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	296.5506579334469
The light touch.	278.8748151529148
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	1158.264964951371
Tame essence of Wilde.	1408.045759157464
You ’ re darned witty.	826.0187391904116
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy ’ s ducats.	1577.1389269168685
How much did I spend?	636.1413264036674
O, a few shillings.	171.08534831918402
For a plump of pressmen.	498.7868005652143
Humour wet and dry.	829.6345516423913
Wit.	412.94388766377165

the quaker librarian was asking.	495.2474562245792
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	1126.1015826542348
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	1305.884988735523
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	795.6849387691956
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	473.8167309441044
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	986.6139462154583
— Telegram! he said.	213.23655308063746
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	1900.3502839439222
Where did you launch it from?	552.6185400737193

Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	968.6447991387312
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	761.3204246491399
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	1094.8075296816319
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	1179.0230867830242
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	1030.793582220228
Stephen laughed.	186.96970227914102
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	1128.8140732523052
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	342.2956455224092
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	766.0185337064346
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	287.4347024062012
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	437.0417632807355
That was your contribution to literature.	543.1963161630601
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	1188.247170094766
— Murder you! he laughed.	310.2173734801078
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	3986.386413214308

— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	526.1906715490846
—...	23.343750950771124
in which everyone can find his own.	416.6290821439689
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	1135.5362162428723
Yes?	154.34777252987385
What is it?	141.4742941874621
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	312.0392566220765
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	607.6370256847192
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	312.39953167392383
Is the gentleman?...	84.45386373334819
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	346.7058217951315
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	298.0400439247302
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	1543.7500775748779
— This gentleman?	358.0044161685089
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	645.1077282632765
Good day, sir.	183.60952753949636
_Kilkenny_...	109.53853326743172
We have certainly...	131.85305185718522
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	1267.2163214700286

Please, sir...	90.73184782935279
The door closed.	282.7059138527756
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	580.2101716397518
He jumped up and snatched the card.	485.078606655136
— What ’ s his name?	154.65004817826764
Bloom.	47.33347058841286
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	603.6791910137405
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	707.0028276086638
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	794.240936601468
Every day we must do homage to her.	631.4612929437358
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	546.1666712935847
He knows your old fellow.	324.7677587046671
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	348.58697060455404
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	2383.405109645492

— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	652.7610094400252
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	614.5967330112712
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	600.7214588579546
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	1074.7138987226717
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	538.9238643033273
His life was rich.	300.1469964746927
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	854.6576061043353
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	1998.3743342006933
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	1248.6761734582585
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	2659.105026224701
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	2621.8360703080516
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	1234.312138490379
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	877.2607050985733

_Encore vingt sous.	5102.130859280853

Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	1089.564901251777
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	1022.3965033965584
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	1254.669597652777
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	1737.148570406169
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	1390.1978364390088
Do and do.	131.18040841675918
Thing done.	571.3997547387496
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	909.4772444426537
An azured harebell like her veins.	2221.301856478236
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	557.1081004764077
He walks.	190.73161525215627
One life is all.	215.64014513543557
One body.	246.7762694003919
Do. But do.	157.28684798829576
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	787.0421737946558
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	1414.85980640583
— Whom do you suspect?	912.3190106778752
he challenged.	225.45270767766806
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	403.4231215901864
Once spurned twice spurned.	2408.5392796763063
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	650.4048146483618
Love that dare not speak its name.	711.930645134135
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	523.6693662897818
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	2649.0227263192496
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	573.9014682795329
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	437.69835880428445
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	696.0864569819205
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	1246.4812029611992
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	295.7662582848951
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	752.4391717035857
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	430.6571590677758
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	327.98626645398474
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	786.3047769857459
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	631.6595930326406
O, yes, mention there is.	188.0204441365691
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	952.0796988297542
Explain you then.	303.99862391515427
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	1721.8597184003042
He faced their silence.	536.4652834341247
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	744.9845650682629
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	934.2280273358158
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	1580.6015209121465
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	1013.6677634717299
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	14681.642852759205
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	1612.2231378333531
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	683.1560285990555
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	731.1276127732269
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	649.4566353253551
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	1202.00172419876
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	3350.8245793220512
Let me think.	246.92282190676178
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	1587.3349799761113
— Do you mean he died so?	435.23664997057017
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	908.283104785951
I mean...	54.339474300858605
— He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	773.7862551448562
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	493.6612270384548
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! — What?	374.30406491365227
asked Besteglinton.	592.5423264025312
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	540.1597649574276
The people ’ s William.	219.4421835136387
Dowden, Highfield house...	300.46801006129493
— Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	1678.8672768298059
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	501.37680787294573
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those <URL> Lovely! Catamite.	870.7372322974142
— The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	1433.3527978183795
Steadfast John replied severe: — The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	1467.8396395409345
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	603.1633230449689
Sayest thou so?	1256.304274815685
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	421.84468631284307
— And the sense of property, Stephen said.	201.5505484153305
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	537.8256161250442
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	1332.6071120969968
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	3518.832141371974
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	1133.7953673891884
How else could Aubrey ’ s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	1937.2753274804695
All events brought grist to his mill.	1274.8647665402
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	1169.7477070354216
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love ’ s Labour Lost_.	1530.9180441739074
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	1596.7197247269748
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter ’ s theory of equivocation.	1099.2939541992018
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	2863.2223859057653
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’ s.	1339.2579612198908
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	3575.285222430512
I think you ’ re getting on very nicely.	451.11766723294915
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	1183.1938763998737
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, <URL> — Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	909.2281593711143
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	924.5998746707916
_Sufflaminandus <URL> — He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	1070.9766371459027
— A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	588.3260721087278
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	1437.6317213733691
_Amplius.	327.7537808406544
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter <URL> — Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	4613.7202476229095
— _Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	1853.3176023758733
There he keened a wailing rune.	1337.0420014760225
— _Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! _ It ’ s destroyed we are from this day! It ’ s destroyed we are surely! All smiled their smiles.	1403.0266013513353
— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	1044.1548717736746
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	717.9185139380152
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	1215.5611451622121
Accusations are made in anger.	900.1458999812928
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	984.5597827723351
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	3432.878088782791
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.	979.2545862086477
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	1768.9059600057433
— Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	849.4259229359798
— Which will?	333.5730118315684
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	1411.1380199504283
We are getting mixed.	559.9681541589033
— The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will ’ s widow, is the will to die.	422.9117826411606
_ — Requiescat! _ Stephen prayed.	417.97587749214114
What of all the will to do?	145.66335519457598
It has vanished long ago...	326.2105217799642
— She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes.	1000.254020835705
In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul.	1010.4720772349995
Venus has twisted her lips in prayer.	870.1143248777687
Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.	1052.201195352073
It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.	1429.361768433715
— History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_.	1654.0751773616948
The ages succeed one another.	932.0296141253858
But we have it on high authority that a man ’ s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family.	582.9279957912726

The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	868.2088878234177

He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	2599.3884549492795
— Why?	171.52821569529442
Stephen answered himself.	259.10397556686894
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	409.0704043517806
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	1853.0067319899088
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	925.1167905835566
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	762.152433424745
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	724.6594311597797
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	762.6148012635646
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	982.3925877487109
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	644.4342890632314
Age has not withered it.	974.2359377316577
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	564.9883742442563
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	917.1283197106296
He laughed to free his mind from his mind ’ s bondage.	422.78463796532316
Judge Eglinton summed up.	1639.7978817665785
— The truth is midway, he affirmed.	508.82151544350836
He is the ghost and the prince.	159.97726114309077
He is all in all.	96.99561405037619
— He is, Stephen said.	96.21812223366321

Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen.	1309.8300973666253
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	2680.776659097991

O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	1233.1855689151425
— And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	1144.4303630687584
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?) _ is right.	913.0770211849441
After God Shakespeare has created most.	1094.2325992655435
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	635.341628769676
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	499.9779503756404

Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet <URL> A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.	1279.5178109620863
And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced.	1118.017569390769
If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa ’ s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	905.6532747188638
Strong curtain.	979.2189864208775

The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	951.8910522534281
_ — Eureka! _ Buck Mulligan cried.	496.71884075063775

Mr Best asked.	272.14530378896416
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	691.3480259158897
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	2148.726827345287
— Well, in that case, he said, I don ’ t see why you should expect payment for it since you don ’ t believe it yourself.	420.4514979332227
Dowden believes there is some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	1202.2778628513604
Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	1246.0614083674297
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	369.54643556344945
But he believes his theory.	512.2500072908842
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	423.0126861447758
That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve?	534.5047583752248
Who helps to believe?	790.0609423424439
<URL> Who to unbelieve?	629.0431461788903

— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	546.1266820230397
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	1314.0619167695027
He broke away.	267.0471922986083
— Come, Kinch.	171.4440909352781
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	461.6771551667968
Come, Kinch.	179.1149441728417
You have eaten all we left.	469.9514952073617
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	834.5737247761773
Stephen rose.	168.58711756699148
Life is many days.	548.5116152865778
This will end.	356.934077653426
— We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	456.50170971772667
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	2115.62026549135
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	1330.121347700328
— Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	493.7865457964736
I ’ ll be there.	127.14897584104409
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	393.5453746188117
Can you walk straight?	781.6007451188863
Laughing, he...	61.90717479068524
Swill till eleven.	1107.6175865485902
Lubber...	109.53853326743172
Stephen followed a lubber...	192.90352350700593
One day in the national library we had a discussion.	520.6391450083798
Shakes.	227.25177915691472
After.	112.09021633397305
His lub back: I followed.	539.9913687079467
I gall his kibe.	710.24742705495
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	967.2003822972861
What have I learned?	357.6341623830399
Of them?	282.94362702375156
Of me?	262.45486445613176
Walk like Haines now.	487.96016312239743
The constant readers ’ room.	676.9356713055084

The quaker ’ s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.	1398.8172099988492
— O please do, sir...	127.28435790440311
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding: — A pleased bottom.	1565.67368026571
The turnstile.	315.89314160412357
Is that?...	62.84030276020132
Blueribboned hat...	177.31649989210544
Idly writing...	244.73384386422393
What?	116.16450681686501
Looked?...	91.30057856244188
The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	3564.765473752525
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won ’ t you wed a wife?	968.8694781356746
He spluttered to the air: — O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	2156.2523658834853
We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers ’ hall.	415.5887176541742
Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M.	1339.7218596685193
Maeterlinck.	327.7537808406544
Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.	1327.1387184745895
He spat blank.	666.9368357823129
Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him.	1675.255273190095
And left the _femme de trente <URL> And why no other children born?	1680.4343473577833

— Longworth and M ’ Curdy Atkinson were there...	458.50480239977
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling: I hardly hear the purlieu cry Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by Before my thoughts begin to run On F.	2201.7222784177206
M ’ Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	1466.231709352037
Jest on.	327.0814230620646
Know thyself.	959.8189034037268
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	596.1234351001287
I halt.	198.11117707451808
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	1354.986684959556
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	792.4805265927963
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	1174.9492061009878
A laugh tripped over his lips.	652.2254582954239
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	805.1939868838367
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	1084.831649240352
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	630.1128750223503
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	682.5172509887188
One thinks of Homer.	649.4144064043777
He stopped at the stairfoot.	350.4997807277971
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	2103.212640478819
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	871.0870451477347
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	1583.6142592866197
But listen.	278.9383662094209
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	2254.0684670160736
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	642.7523237964579
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	521.1766417474656
Part.	260.138348246505
The moment is now.	191.73091247162557
Where then?	261.4950765936243
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	1310.9269718857684
Why?	184.539251337404
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	453.3826702830268
My will: his will that fronts me.	414.05868379254235
Seas between.	654.8432036178012
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	466.9445150365372
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	309.57382828357345
The portico.	375.6623715761857
Here I watched the birds for augury.	709.1643037783385
Ængus of the birds.	283.2282645225388
They go, they come.	183.44888989768572
Last night I flew.	509.8800523133578
Easily flew.	979.2189864208784
Men wondered.	926.0881397841399
Street of harlots after.	543.4536864170811
A creamfruit melon he held to me.	697.2897949535351
In. You will see.	170.34972740444817
— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	765.8644897901225
Did you see his eye?	342.874239831969
He looked upon you to lust after you.	366.86451321479797
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	628.2761221461886
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	402.8651854914114
Get thee a breechpad.	912.0329231934807
Manner of Oxenford.	978.11324366434
Day.	180.3698566476659
Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	1098.8380513287186
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	634.4228167693207
They followed.	208.1281412098765
Speak on.	208.98641979256388
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	1457.0982370362774
No birds.	284.08400734780196
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	1550.793859907891
Cease to strive.	944.6190342348739
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.	1539.6698765602991
Laud we the gods And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our bless ’ d altars.	2329.2229205866793
The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	509.5841695592934
J.	70.96904591365316
reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	1167.1970058748543
Five to three.	242.33056258388635
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	668.7565243681003
What was that boy ’ s name again?	274.40149177147146
Dignam.	98.80602369420697
Yes.	72.08392493010007
_Vere dignum et iustum <URL> Brother Swan was the person to see.	2911.4690501564996
Mr Cunningham ’ s letter.	210.77679298059132
Yes.	72.08392493010007
Oblige him, if possible.	404.1073359883852
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	1810.8212557488257
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	1930.13081788529
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	1192.0648712516347
J.	70.96904591365316
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	500.6006229117024
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	990.2400027040802
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	824.315082142008
And you, father?	146.59675884231157
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	951.3708009012023
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	533.9192123685505
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	541.3302457429553
Was that so?	274.7972012642904
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	595.5619638320142
And Mr Sheehy himself?	601.4131489850639
Still in London.	245.98261757077225
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	251.48595049789367
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	769.3298266378918
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	947.5680519826644
O, yes: a very great success.	302.1470760573543
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	776.9103678611766
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	529.2511594222119
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	826.8565730320013
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	631.9142217905419
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	846.0778969370423
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	1318.1221102186717
A zealous man, however.	417.02007139801344
Really he was.	209.31523416013894
And really did great good in his way.	360.8677526865357
Beyond a doubt.	494.32438219696013
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	197.09420661707833
Of good family too would one think it?	674.0082044913219
Welsh, were they not?	325.41678596411424
O, lest he forget.	294.27861433513425
That letter to father provincial.	498.9151402869183
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	356.6665509444606
The little house.	174.11521314851572
Aha.	191.6715737888812
And were they good boys at school?	609.9555515456985
O.	51.15590757957263
That was very good now.	256.078142535261
And what was his name?	215.20733607327145
Jack Sohan.	856.518350232876
And his name?	184.47509200101211
Ger.	327.7537808406544
Gallaher.	198.52271484804842
And the other little man?	228.0614126493359
His name was Brunny Lynam.	922.0842042182315
O, that was a very nice name to have.	184.67855451083193
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	946.9354789329569
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	372.7239681009752
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	553.8306745186159
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	408.7425059765056
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	1063.3771253171353
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	1330.9725721659518
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	1731.2765617459404
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	594.7082959489588
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	1124.6586361616073
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	564.5066757065841
A fine carriage she had.	377.1534966727706
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	470.1691464078162
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	233.4798257765325
what should he say?...	112.25358752873441
such a queenly mien.	783.446956781385
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	1089.7656989233196
The reverend T.	381.9243922685511
R.	167.44054250722874
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	288.9485997178692
The incumbent they called him.	441.0590550801522
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	431.44476511429707
But one should be charitable.	618.101028108555
Invincible ignorance.	1646.843470859384
They acted according to their lights.	901.4879226207523
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	783.7513940830937
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	548.102432885841
Surely, there ought to be.	323.2595443820242
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	1685.0734418734785
All raised untidy caps.	1500.6821283077213
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	1520.7822226529352
Christian brother boys.	1116.2539615130586
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	710.8350273076255
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	801.40494396744
For aged and virtuous females.	1173.5838748582623
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	633.205603714018
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	1648.8204835840963
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	2142.772056972456
And now it was an office or something.	306.3418180069261
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	959.6179024643519
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	1807.1517767919854
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	1312.655725786159
In America those things were continually happening.	1936.8934525566256
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	730.4029807745451
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	579.9822092216796
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	1552.9471569929256
They saluted him and were saluted.	409.4663048180038
Father Conmee passed H.	664.0881642314787
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	1495.6802817925375
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	1081.733537238398
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	787.6572977906042
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	1530.798737976647
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	977.5907921975623
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	1112.3554690433093
J.	70.96904591365316
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	1214.0540318073824
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	3062.30108834317
C.	96.23846299732125
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	645.1945988567973
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	2829.8584048002394
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	1128.537951064631
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	1945.2453316932838
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	803.8369519451184
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	2267.866364640776
It was a peaceful day.	301.71545193593136
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	868.9136432919324
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	508.1980471992723
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	357.0898979411681
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	2109.4208085413984
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	543.1896685035189
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	639.4222573709216
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	649.577824088143
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	676.163809558281
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	772.5653899495153
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	2594.8524326637985
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	717.849259436715
J.	70.96904591365316
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	508.35404951637895
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	2172.0722120067912
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	927.1563919976861
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	388.5993239954263
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	498.48832661612755
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	889.9513378328412
The Malahide road was quiet.	561.6664244549128
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	480.04781773126126
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	1342.9273899521772
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	2129.4067606250283
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	353.41750897855087
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	1398.7558014602846
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	933.6822084096443
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	1256.4015570971005
Who could know the truth?	401.8223601520617
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	2418.2072850337945
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	808.8530764827694
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	258.22496897927107
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	640.7595176971035
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	745.870720858566
He was humane and honoured there.	458.86383131183374
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	521.4455401979944
It was a charming day.	254.95959353814015
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	1661.6087482384655
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	933.8353371083494
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	241.6791284095635
A just and homely word.	433.87925776023934
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	1225.1825729197571
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	1730.2196284768245
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	376.3472376066125
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	606.2364423118686
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	1145.837093946359
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	974.1908765089553
Nones.	412.94388766377165
He should have read that before lunch.	505.3644794252305
But lady Maxwell had come.	737.7231285106049
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	1236.1808467969156
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	2220.9917714521225
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	1318.0044286051484
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	1061.531948492841
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	4723.6093809520125
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	868.2722839820906
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	600.8046484771988
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	872.8784883740265
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	1533.4425235966928
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	1308.6483497768036
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	340.2814103324503
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	216.96216834625358
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	319.57420427586976
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	235.09960591712027
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	1780.8283820693496
— What ’ s the best news?	246.94932109111778
he asked.	81.11898566253105
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	742.1057154052945
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	850.3012164502271
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	1130.502531023057
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	569.1742758438565
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	752.4732995319728
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	1744.2208211057737
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	657.229779566336
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	2214.738110054598
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	1288.028299462905
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	370.5905280600563
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	1699.2758581629316
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	670.6555356096387
It fell on the path.	276.73937646330467
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	400.0591053588019
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	1070.8426378875556
— Did you put in the books?	295.00259891834696
Boody asked.	325.3652798630798
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	2983.3887307683176
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	279.3419221735451
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	2412.0370923453565
— Where did you try?	389.03120221493293
Boody asked.	325.3652798630798
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	183.8509013451639
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	797.683881613424
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	599.8741854043517
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	728.866742356105
— What ’ s in the pot?	165.57933461672278
she asked.	111.59059573182334
— Shirts, Maggy said.	406.7742938063994
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	856.0682527226476
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	453.19973811134486
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	1164.5852329708755
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	406.7742938063994
Katey asked.	342.1044716547483
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	618.6639795857103
The lacquey rang his bell.	733.5622713526608
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	624.5110643287352
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	1400.8773481853214
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	1000.2189057493297
Where ’ s Dilly?	306.3013790877421
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	419.5465745771764
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	894.2463393570939
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	1606.460322434214
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	2336.664010518623
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	1504.804834624364
— Put these in first, will you?	323.559055638307
he said.	50.91883309542916
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	200.39069040946865
And the fruit on top.	266.35520200515833
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	403.4201112255627
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	2054.48737811487
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	2079.495285621816
H.	134.40797648581974
E.	132.89764665905037
L.	135.98939187633997
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	1233.4885099229389
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	780.9087395798795
— Can you send them by tram?	636.722919514455
Now?	227.12711207754768
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	1821.5688704688116
— Certainly, sir.	184.0872909069714
Is it in the city?	211.5396407668608
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	211.4924517979614
Ten minutes.	473.22694716583624
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	858.1880680054378
— Will you write the address, sir?	360.341632762074
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	575.894279058107
— Send it at once, will you?	303.26084151272187
he said.	50.91883309542916
It ’ s for an invalid.	303.46414158027903
— Yes, sir.	108.77084343331529
I will, sir.	97.43132896205516
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	959.6322211052136
— What ’ s the damage?	228.42322192818705
he asked.	81.11898566253105
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	996.4499126647822
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	533.5908986909714
A young pullet.	578.5946046230708
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	891.0563317085573
he asked gallantly.	368.38631934873683
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	777.1680396411842
— Yes, sir, she said.	115.15884527851286
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	4127.279683394296
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	783.7973918178593
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	591.5606727401868
he asked roguishly.	423.16475903930643
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	1044.5453446698475
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	974.5857156411707
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	1675.0608263594172
Palefaces.	327.7537808406544
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	1446.7990040691543
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	1219.1037349441642
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	6617.955195334007
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	39459.564038817014
È peccato.	2167.3678953985213
Perchè la sua voce...	1416.1547084031085
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	7757.295980806576
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	605.7034601179873
_Ma, dia retta a me.	908.463759734701
Ci rifletta_.	2167.3678953985213
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	2398.8548170303884
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	809.4538649295748
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	1210.9253552888213
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	541.9603702041977
Human eyes.	393.11049926965694
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	1434.7578198859846
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	899.1065325798066
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	5508.5037425940955
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	615.4679512003113
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	1777.8225084841513
_Scusi, eh?	684.2268949029144
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	3136.889137641926
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	2287.2585175285144
Too much mystery business in it.	584.3215877468426
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	259.09895488234275
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	1408.5867648746496
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	901.0924884668287
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	934.816479087506
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny ’ s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone ’ s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	2069.5295441529165

Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	1595.4339735124786
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	1310.9001044017657
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	262.26854671900486
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	268.78560015587766
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	505.4289126099162
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	1129.392396312918
They kick out grand.	521.613417334509
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	699.3489794673206
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	763.9103898634762
— Hello.	132.99853656848234
Yes, sir.	103.75279190799161
No, sir.	98.64345810123032
Yes, sir.	103.75279190799161
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	338.08401889992837
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	408.6948245012075
All right, sir.	165.4670577834052
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	433.93940198782883
A quarter after.	285.19794963605165
Yes, sir.	103.75279190799161
Twentyseven and six.	473.3027271359427
I ’ ll tell him.	145.32575690624742
Yes: one, seven, six.	205.90797890744417
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	1022.6005782498233
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	498.471544675008
Mr Lenehan, yes.	153.63797748795423
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	218.5744520447967
No, sir.	98.64345810123032
Yes, sir.	103.75279190799161
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	338.08401889992837
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	1431.1976449467245
— Who ’ s that?	134.6000039983404
Ned Lambert asked.	413.3871669963992
Is that Crotty?	816.0121320097114
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	1086.0285213963077
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	276.9485519628626
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	1679.3527518975156
Come on.	106.48988963715681
Mind your steps there.	543.0560053760978
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	884.6171362814533
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	1269.4657269791735
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	594.4354603314569
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	350.0012236187201
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	1591.3295580666709
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	515.8973402286019
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	748.0069811908863
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	335.594797450247
— No, Ned.	125.67500936743524
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	937.3561185173592
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	225.69745550186374
That ’ s quite right, sir.	200.6628660215076
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	297.17313134276435
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	345.4950325156571
Bring the camera whenever you like.	774.464265707032
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	639.9664737120248
You can take it from here or from here.	353.1843268699083
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	908.4421391020127
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	595.3727293301607
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	374.514564666601
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	338.2938984001716
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	336.06242312575404
Drop in whenever you like.	446.74936836904055
Next week, say.	423.9209247417574
Can you see?	307.33099968558673
— Yes, yes.	113.10971072533658
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	385.27206502610306
Very pleased to have met you.	477.9861265808378
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	555.8195459182508
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	894.7451626787469
With J.	168.48544115475738
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	1670.284184366099
He stood to read the card in his hand.	228.02521614933121
— The reverend Hugh C.	522.6719861645712
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	930.0354861264532
Nice young chap he is.	374.9406937625942
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	364.9480716937043
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	234.38255756272156
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	1246.814763274889
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	453.4169794851766
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Molloy said.	162.78555399086
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	482.63855599269624
— God! he cried.	169.72040621547077
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	672.5734481870733
You know that one?	231.2962652063672
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	504.47612264403705
What?	116.16450681686501
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	224.73155812302852
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	476.23353463567764
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	446.54314866869595
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	1769.6460254712429
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	1091.060149546024
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	247.93271688891537
What is it?	141.4742941874621
What ’ s the trouble?	167.57573911918965
Wait awhile.	402.5898436248765
Hold hard.	386.3881843637711
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	734.0508219102996
— Chow! he said.	225.95270652049163
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	604.3560594253468
J.	70.96904591365316
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	236.12514517593834
cold night before...	131.86978798532215
blast your soul...	194.5995777389022
night before last...	113.32523197599727
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	145.49315687165137
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	228.22507177758587
— I was...	38.16388895148569
Glasnevin this morning...	181.59387497229605
poor little...	72.5107145026207
what do you call him...	116.50893885011234
Chow!...	108.5304756275721
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	1702.6430074998386
— See?	208.90134690939195
he said.	50.91883309542916
Say it ’ s turn six.	332.20620567976493
In here, see.	139.8271082339776
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	660.740935721858
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	687.5740940595077
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	1774.1730651336838
— See?	208.90134690939195
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	491.98708766274666
The impact.	315.89314160412357
Leverage, see?	412.7607715348215
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	554.7759421316769
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	656.4861950407503
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	533.8360661746319
— See?	208.90134690939195
Tom Rochford said.	400.09263572542517
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	684.4120197847005
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	303.49833068217583
One good turn deserves another.	965.5864255034894
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	319.411529478657
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	426.04633261367627
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	584.4893341921045
When you two begin...	188.383339764878
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	916.8509273963875
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	513.7199923280712
he asked.	81.11898566253105
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	288.3763047969885
See you later.	355.4906108056567
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	160.81431459240758
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	178.30648037282037
The drain, you mean.	322.247524459617
— Drain?	555.4995880672506
Lenehan said.	117.61841135128405
It was down a manhole.	307.71201284281113
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	1648.9758890158755
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	1372.5096164350582
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	941.8005200194331
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	676.0552908917219
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	570.320068040234
— The act of a hero, he said.	162.60628646931445
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	1246.623008008034
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	158.8216057058042
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	721.6464433482142
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	364.6980984023559
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	1235.9125706484506
— After three, he said.	153.25140454151094
Who ’ s riding her?	313.626796993279
— O.	65.53010286921746
Madden, Lenehan said.	185.03474648479434
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	1642.7235406457548
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	1246.0913722245746
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	935.6390747366241
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	458.35373937099814
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	938.5135314056007
Through here.	298.08298249421273
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	551.745634615429
— There he is, Lenehan said.	144.33606950631898
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	406.8370918129183
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	313.2282151903097
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	406.27497736818424
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	391.70915305635714
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	606.6343663377493
Astronomy it was about.	282.5659465016435
Lenehan laughed.	274.2625339774977
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	365.4937973426708
Come over in the sun.	171.4437880477214
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	966.8875973279889
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	741.4113589587365
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	761.9982211464888
The annual dinner, you know.	336.9471700927644
Boiled shirt affair.	1925.8811873505647
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	818.7644369398043
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	660.7230224879318
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	231.83924228802292
My missus sang there once.	859.8349531831824
— Did she?	225.06210652438543
Lenehan said.	117.61841135128405
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	2048.1475538767513
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	858.6219528688174
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	225.95683904600813
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	1812.2915683921594
Bloom and the wife were there.	135.5422742076116
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	1556.5647874969122
Fast and furious it was.	469.5235696457587
After liquids came solids.	2474.0146202909905
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	1749.6970386844398
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	178.30648037282037
The year the missus was there...	148.85323650214733
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	1230.7064306693935
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	225.95683904600813
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	814.483078076165
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	849.3430896276923
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	276.556790948198
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	1927.1862076702334
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	1046.2106223116657
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	1013.8148662736883
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	635.8861494543652
Like that.	114.52974468043327
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	783.4810279144461
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	698.1029864122878
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	399.864093333279
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	494.0227217546449
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	590.6086620142875
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	204.5689594134634
He knows them all, faith.	237.79805219508788
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	415.8056584896692
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	404.95581378028527
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	567.5117702797636
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	784.1572188457326
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	282.12813606296237
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	707.8813123576344
Lenehan walked on again.	295.7364427291461
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	1340.363137440267
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	501.00037375857886
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	315.89908812988745
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	180.94104408151318
you know...	46.52618652791199
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	253.9146076066591
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	2490.0648173811715
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	2829.9318195014976
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	341.24101555648997
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	406.76358806964686
Child born every minute somewhere.	1656.8308030763908
Mrs Purefoy.	291.8866553446509
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	1945.4183971002665
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	160.4380060044497
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	945.6303612554013
— Them are two good ones, he said.	389.2065746765971
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	607.4235642755347
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	936.2909837944445
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	2029.1405314425522
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	242.654015464271
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	3160.4285262853746
Know the kind that is.	202.46244180282216
Had it?	255.53245448506163
Yes.	72.08392493010007
He opened it.	160.19036790772867
Thought so.	282.77850634473674
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	512.6402008041894
Listen: the man.	155.43979650638116
Got her it once.	245.33067528156607
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	636.7718875179025
More in her line.	252.51858748466537
Let us see.	262.30779420266094
He read where his finger opened.	486.2654236047226
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	420.1286909600113
This.	106.07353399557181
Here.	103.77932914467516
Try.	185.6778706854622
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	1349.2676419642473
Take this.	223.72437809340323
The end.	129.87428986177133
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	809.1613403782786
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	2408.97356582807
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	1262.565937870555
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	1478.157595240687
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	4191.109107979119
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	1516.817783039976
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	1327.6621298385953
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	2160.025054655687
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	2346.9939914033803
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	1404.8829327979577
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	1270.018083517264
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	1097.8523985339475
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	1347.7735663697097
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	953.6957847530697
Mr Bloom beheld it.	256.22404935607267
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	411.84867690718175
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	1903.6368453442683
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	264.502602079658
That ’ s a good one.	130.29726270936425
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	489.3887464627514
Four and nine.	300.7557777074372
Those lovely curtains.	887.7085099917106
Five shillings.	418.4075493141318
Cosy curtains.	1120.4710166696884
Selling new at two guineas.	872.0389945208432
Any advance on five shillings?	1624.8556807513746
Going for five shillings.	595.7527424680621
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	1792.6049543877355
J.	70.96904591365316
A.	48.14463764461572
Jackson, W.	372.22388554764063

Munro and H.	451.8611200283076
T.	143.15965009292913
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	1543.338717595601
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	604.3446236725179
He halted near his daughter.	387.74145236332527
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	129.18219863861947
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	342.6978871061533
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	985.7615808947099
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	1603.1586031327074
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	401.72683841188456
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	255.77905962898166
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	481.3225879831397
Do you know what you look like?	391.22686488495873
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	934.5865102015238
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	213.68674283195398
All the people are looking at you.	260.4277862247995
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	845.70216893524
— Did you get any money?	470.41648055037473
Dilly asked.	276.79902407404154
— Where would I get money?	376.2313858902694
Mr Dedalus said.	139.450159149983
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	702.6586999022601
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	246.13355671555868
— How do you know that?	252.50585234847355
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	275.833212654217
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	612.3598877389707
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	251.08321673991543
Were you in the Scotch house now?	447.28896869137947
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	879.1366442744129
Here.	103.77932914467516
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	234.19361651153486
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	298.46630698698954
Give me more than that.	287.4774519657452
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	592.6177280230935
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	211.26340912320023
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	2053.409845284047
But wait awhile.	509.9710794624071
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	417.38159507481106
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	591.7840312253558
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	618.0743796101434
He ’ s dead.	108.2787968522416
The man upstairs is dead.	385.5487993585115
He left her and walked on.	172.04131865730565
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	822.4044484338792
— Well, what is it?	162.1637453523011
he said, stopping.	134.9561190463163
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	1257.6539249756854
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	714.5652053847992
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	1029.3407645001193
— Watch him, he said.	134.0276605471645
It ’ s instructive.	216.10173797697308
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	279.84143230071527
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	282.14257916980023
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	423.634437719369
Look, there ’ s all I have.	139.4988357044661
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	706.0816019560993
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	940.1062009477916
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	481.1672488547486
Dilly said.	173.74826857966934
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	342.3396434113033
— I will, he said gravely.	148.2287460147573
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	411.61536670622235
I ’ ll try this one now.	272.91031067129416
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	451.4031027467393
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	426.46274479148053
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	443.21170012078875
I ’ ll be home shortly.	335.03229493356844
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	347.71074096410797
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	1264.4614117943952
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	373.893354897927
The lacquey banged loudly.	1332.1084885275436
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	1204.6184539486353
Got round him all right.	320.9413357418962
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	436.52911887372073
First rate, sir.	362.52943334239416
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	558.8534845914375
How are things going?	509.28647855320366
Just keeping alive.	934.9373737088921
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	721.9232631305023
Yes, indeed.	155.40190444077464
Good for the country.	171.974231839418
Those farmers are always grumbling.	1973.649547859649
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	661.3658445009621
Yes, sir.	103.75279190799161
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	5990.841851568733
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	983.1029259400534
And heartrending scenes.	1012.3285515738462
Men trampling down women and children.	1080.9336943450353
Most brutal thing.	989.3287439642285
What do they say was the cause?	325.31022328462683
Spontaneous combustion.	1532.5605361623102
Most scandalous revelation.	2272.880601485986
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	1276.8332642154373
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	435.90045189544566
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	440.94754805122767
You know why?	397.58959923591743
Palm oil.	1083.6839476992607
Is that a fact?	267.88591686037677
Without a doubt.	446.31582135946496
Well now, look at that.	177.56480667404804
And America they say is the land of the free.	290.61182288000447
I thought we were bad here.	365.8137808201351
I smiled at him.	148.6775382241045
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	268.45022586276355
_What is it?	383.8318443789156
The sweepings of every country including our own.	1046.4732515447167
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	267.7943882667844
Graft, my dear sir.	469.3709769113595
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	311.16976001079865
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	705.4378594663544
Dress does it.	412.64908961521735
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	807.7804494826208
Bowls them over.	481.5113810580689
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	287.90127090147905
How are things?	399.6072045097543
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	327.9642316460383
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	1220.04754920992
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	745.1835151295905
Scott of Dawson street.	710.3271480803501
Never built under three guineas.	1241.9316580336827
Fits me down to the ground.	361.26716723744306
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	1664.377869701523
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	801.9978765798968
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	858.8828684144787
Knight of the road.	276.04430576646905
Gentleman.	286.319300185858
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	431.64683940257373
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	510.0991092316697
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	1155.8364860451143
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	682.6901370064389
High colour, of course.	257.32286659835074
Grizzled moustache.	1012.4598556494906
Returned Indian officer.	2297.591634063759
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	1977.8295148594461
Is that Ned Lambert ’ s brother over the way, Sam?	526.0634992480283
What?	116.16450681686501
Yes.	72.08392493010007
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	175.98389251244515
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	351.11080243111667
Damn like him.	223.5575592925045
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	2320.1078100960344
Good drop of gin, that was.	310.0256778978777
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	1943.6823056599364
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	1107.8401148899995
Greasy black rope.	1255.8045984658875
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant ’ s wife drove by in her noddy.	767.8583685331838
Bad times those were.	503.91171622444426
Well, well.	123.62013047794834
Over and done with.	235.21263912412368
Great topers too.	838.5899105104476
Fourbottle men.	633.5085698344069
Let me see.	201.6947959226942
Is he buried in saint Michan ’ s?	625.2036201971674
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	537.7925583596146
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	484.86433514171864
Dignam is there now.	218.18942743697625
Went out in a puff.	395.46231717151244
Well, well.	123.62013047794834
Better turn down here.	472.861390868762
Make a detour.	624.9902177283473
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	1555.3047775163286
Damn dangerous thing.	1067.3397333080304
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	1704.4793639418117
Runaway horse.	815.0610411291826
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton ’ s office, led his wife over O ’ Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	895.7355714794012
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	1103.2510190881362
Times of the troubles.	304.8719806716384
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	441.8803988277028
Gaming at Daly ’ s.	522.9942728491117
No cardsharping then.	586.9995222467397
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	587.9895136642707
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	5222.683341192271
Stables behind Moira house.	1928.5289802423479
Damn good gin that was.	530.4216698215608
Fine dashing young nobleman.	2445.1259643286435
Good stock, of course.	238.62502394091075
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	780.495830376566
Course they were on the wrong side.	387.33181584946846
They rose in dark and evil days.	480.72097625425545
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	958.2852577873466
They were gentlemen.	300.03483036330965
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	1902.1670521759436
Masterly rendition.	1822.5318937766035
_At the siege of Ross did my father <URL> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	1504.8226344404138
Frockcoats.	412.94388766377165
Cream sunshades.	1384.824771129642
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	1503.8511536159108
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	812.6087104989025
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	1396.2442155686163
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	789.5021919818579
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	2065.423331315773
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	1558.4827296254555
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	854.318069676499
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	1295.3219595839257
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	1482.9982571674605
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	2382.3067322734205
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	1013.0378833802636
A long and seafed silent rut.	1022.114637234312
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	1623.7891685416057
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	925.4246072589864
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	3493.495868206549
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	1054.3454548096543
The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes.	1155.5416306237405
A lore of drugs.	595.1991364999982
Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.	1917.230530744712
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	1387.6924917556719
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	1599.9935697868443
Beingless beings.	1384.824771129642
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	904.8861961947779
Your heart you sing of.	327.3731598508525
I between them.	125.34694294389858
Where?	182.8914914813631
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	1121.253898184751
Shatter them, one and both.	272.1873889746541
But stun myself too in the blow.	605.1080113113061
Shatter me you who can.	437.3833906009907
Bawd and butcher were the words.	504.99658052588285
I say! Not yet awhile.	465.0348111887121
A look around.	266.57955551171113
Yes, quite true.	246.04895334457197
You say right, sir.	205.04155292634002
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	1059.0731111662335
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	1783.6620316817346
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	3595.260557716473
The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	2656.3203762082258

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	961.1914052591117
How are things?	399.6072045097543
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	327.9642316460383
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	1384.6531715222654
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	1537.8117642534585
— What ’ s the best news?	246.94932109111778
Mr Dedalus said.	139.450159149983
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	332.6637051866415
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	775.3767492614438
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	234.48637066592343
Who is it?	177.46290437355003
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	902.4231440402027
— With a broken back, is it?	230.36769899966728
Mr Dedalus asked.	202.40175295641495
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	324.58532307563274
Reuben of that ilk.	406.9687154420494
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	327.7483422045047
All I want is a little time.	229.63849680711684
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	578.080443340733
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	185.09264926108602
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	757.016105822774
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	822.7588139920903
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	190.5999376126066
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	1668.8061329395898
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	1465.4993858544972
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	613.1794975852669
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	331.2487619392985
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	1214.6696364927584
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	474.35533052717994
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	951.8406465740268
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	677.4373831482959
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	506.7190839545308
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	343.2673908498409
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	1047.2005142807357
Father Cowley asked.	370.922235805667
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	2047.160218314304
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	778.543022368519
— Aw! he said.	249.47201385549113
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	313.6850750216911
— What about that?	161.7240126954536
Ben Dollard said.	281.71397449132456
Not too dusty?	747.0319686886439
What?	116.16450681686501
He turned to both.	181.21554665451842
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	367.9522949934325
The reverend Hugh C.	652.7618403951284
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	826.926970318347
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	232.04867280040312
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	565.2279771896975
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	613.0702621591386
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	304.41479946074236
Come along.	217.88983150942096
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	549.4646481899454
Wait awhile...	134.35962707095896
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	273.9735460761337
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	578.715083357766
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	1669.4746046796934
— What few days?	396.31835533658636
he boomed.	225.45270767766806
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	1912.2882908189006
— He has, Father Cowley said.	214.92408503189975
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	462.1294015208389
The landlord has the prior claim.	947.4389696066369
I gave him all the particulars.	250.98438224470968
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	998.1286181982059
Love is the name?	243.35629400263835
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	214.84702033163236
The reverend Mr Love.	377.5210212120537
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	258.0149805823705
But are you sure of that?	228.85793441762686
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	774.1884484257203
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	941.4536146239558
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	522.9677350265391
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	678.2226982107303
The policeman touched his forehead.	730.7276261809625
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	449.6555061811931
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	935.4199785585333
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	634.4710440680808
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	399.80193230971037
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	434.91329827544075
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	866.0250388118222
— Boyd?	422.0884103782564
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	592.4718448393941
Touch me not.	258.50940384212555
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	1005.0873125326044
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	2544.5033818483157
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	2496.8730943759733
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	714.7394445725193
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	384.0113969843044
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	389.73727806247
And put down the five shillings too.	352.48927677510704
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	479.0197273955806
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	662.3920925705169
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	1380.3407511466949
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	467.85385935203647
They went down Parliament street.	625.2157939768277
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	485.4531442317548
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	352.6544198664185
Here goes.	302.1935399024515
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	2240.6180447090182
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	1306.542995282436
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	1232.8555195074919
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	958.1012154185493
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	1796.8389414091378
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	947.4354305552365
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	569.4514518856356
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	817.2020770585498
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	440.322746149404
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	694.5643915768832
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	2191.882651435617
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	3439.8131578733633
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	1117.876660849161
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	1287.3477660798649
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	387.84328619729445
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	1304.315661203206
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	947.795425045632
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	1025.3139910287798
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	920.8399653728925
— What Dignam was that?	211.641589616885
long John Fanning asked.	553.8529902060595
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	855.7944797161548
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	351.8213154122396
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	1083.389134314306
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	1157.0339163413632
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	315.03753014146645
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	796.6589104203869
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	751.58852344813
— Rather lowsized.	824.0305533218026
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	296.5754742936968
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	768.7727070963773
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	1089.9995434079965
— What ’ s that?	114.48218109093882
Martin Cunningham said.	241.8911764651346
All turned where they stood.	423.24684432336494
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	776.9573304560543
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	1237.1354321182794
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	1021.6647984932531
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	1113.896122022298
— What was it?	130.6379079736118
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	339.7689295414383
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	1001.3319868665856
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	1416.4919705513776
There in the corner.	117.71933381685145
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	1352.2709711063383
— Is that he?	161.13699905900333
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	476.94773685078115
— Yes, Mulligan said.	128.3190705977047
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	462.0744685811929
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	1755.0653387744092
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	838.1374545522499
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	318.02581420798833
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	434.2588612224186
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	846.7209853769933
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	531.912880026625
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	823.0995703322395
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	153.2078137807289
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	835.7633823898732
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	878.2388481070427
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	937.7637189170711
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	422.00161749445016
Wandering Ængus I call him.	833.189075774908
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	990.6375505261905
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	629.7791052161386
Such persons always have.	854.3818950734814
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	787.7341191241916
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	522.955568870217
He will never capture the Attic note.	1141.9967612880325
That is his tragedy.	270.4527442952943
He can never be a poet.	273.507016972836
The joy of creation...	162.09131071692988
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	966.6513877653
I see.	67.86952710487904
I tackled him this morning on belief.	720.1830292692333
There was something on his mind, I saw.	214.98297267922183
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	1035.4883914788422
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	681.1904471168301
He helped her to unload her tray.	722.1223243768601
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	933.6307518269819
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	817.9163850264466
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	1025.4533968211535
Does he write anything for your movement?	959.8340800714523
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	2275.457556320722
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	2295.6156204635895
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	681.620841004376
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	267.80482914767464
He is going to write something in ten years.	379.0433442755037
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	587.1214767446179
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	385.83218487782597
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	793.4532526028005
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	490.97686805305284
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	308.23791339183106
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	2336.3810203214152
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	1983.263041617775
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	1808.5422912055703
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	1025.5964579259132
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	2325.060230956969
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	783.7889547939823
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	973.4716082376922
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	1861.3675559178796
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	2282.9407020632198
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	1278.97846052192
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	1012.0317149711302
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	1412.7811191925962
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	1310.8939581695363
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	1520.4081466986347
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	3523.373762455385
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	453.00736679939837
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	511.76099745607723
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	1379.2070545469603
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	627.7075251425888
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	404.8881276098326
That ’ s me in mourning.	172.03696075121022
When is it?	210.83125974954524
May the twentysecond.	446.83428247882875
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	316.7659937785757
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	456.68044702857225
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	895.9021963111038
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	866.679525787229
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	704.4859811039021
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	1192.1870442902878
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	546.8735016803038
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	1362.238973673446
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	655.5636097560852
No Sandymount tram.	647.0150920168438
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	918.0103989904801
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	609.4094537751329
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	615.7428334908291
He met schoolboys with satchels.	883.9185896128353
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	741.0786571517881
He met other schoolboys.	523.6938881503607
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	496.5628036010847
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	634.4696730694269
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	359.3103870520875
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	471.0035767059335
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	837.0972585146799
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	826.9156634082177
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	355.3031985713828
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	710.5792366269619
Never see him again.	277.4363878479315
Death, that is.	144.52234640722915
Pa is dead.	444.1005819161498
My father is dead.	312.39719598613374
He told me to be a good son to ma.	297.4043281424821
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	397.96832832523484
Poor pa.	442.7969929420823
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	222.75386664558593
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	620.6459787751847

In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	998.799130528364

A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	2542.4518735930556
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	1026.0173595792073
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	2117.713263149731

A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	1995.350496576829

Be pfrwritt.	1024.8850003480125
Done.	227.25177915691472
Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	799.068219315668
— Is that her?	177.19666200226717
asked miss Kennedy.	473.85447037377213
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	1179.5563512533588
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	788.4502092117717
— Who?	160.92060442380037
Where?	182.8914914813631
gold asked more eagerly.	649.1573150809959
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	380.42372958010867
He ’ s looking.	109.35650756005985
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	855.411040706967
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	761.9849802757998
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	1583.6605474759383
With sadness.	631.2173620701237
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	1744.749378592149
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	1020.7211837584858
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	1989.0369600699266
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	319.79861605830456
A man.	96.51593775225432
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	1356.3550126416505
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	290.7409984305127
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	209.270864625863
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	1681.732269128465
— What is it?	140.8458157135941
loud boots unmannerly asked.	1481.7026375480934
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	1038.801277516764
— Your _beau, _ is it?	348.11649495658145
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	1259.6784329910083
Bloom.	47.33347058841286
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	1454.2574944326411
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	659.7462056926454
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	1547.1626171322118
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	925.2966937003174
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	519.4971896017479
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	1365.0085479207255
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	658.8561865202604
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	1286.2915953182837
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	1253.7857458768076
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	1186.792656819965
It gets brown after.	518.9111636977082
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	1328.5446101575806
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	196.61120875745198
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	673.8773615768589
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	1582.2803273692066
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	485.0540865661969
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	765.44806424008
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	2153.8093398125925
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	163.8833427587204
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	266.0773769205497
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	1363.6645618216635
says he.	64.45760785269151
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	562.5829596453859
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	1571.1906563082093
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	1114.4604120790727
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	926.290280749143
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	2031.6861254133016
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	2348.7492646434775
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	558.8497090884057
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	1125.6875919778365
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	1496.5135051444438
Why do I always think Figather?	996.9736425395967
Gathering figs, I think.	665.0104224098075
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	1343.268518196886
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	702.8593134002537
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	290.7108127720652
God they believe she is: or goddess.	429.19210139288924
Those today.	335.7725630492737
I could not see.	145.81307928961272
That fellow spoke.	345.80063096637133
A student.	204.48798585064537
After with Dedalus ’ son.	263.05864337080885
He might be Mulligan.	215.41926575009546
All comely virgins.	907.7348742871171
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	631.1278487340442
By went his eyes.	236.1328801721164
The sweets of sin.	338.60420358146024
Sweet are the sweets.	398.14196526007635
Of sin.	364.6523272845654
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	1815.0211529077887
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	1125.884346111183
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	700.6654566514097
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	1146.5093413867198
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	1034.5447277520734
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	933.9988092350958
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	652.7425327247528
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	1039.0062561377633
And then laughed more.	310.87536628128197
Greasy I knows.	450.55104009908877
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	1410.2353731565881
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	429.2518887272701
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	307.989456991874
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	1055.6250502562175
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	511.599056943517
I feel all wet.	260.84473171941937
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	733.8760217135067
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	923.675858044268
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	1443.22582433059
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	800.0213932525905
Religion pays.	1251.3304378412884
Must see him for that par.	342.17058935196974
Eat first.	333.1180262944813
I want.	88.4216964831649
Not yet.	241.28892517597617
At four, she said.	191.68120419617173
Time ever passing.	522.5922348951417
Clockhands turning.	884.8242381027072
On. Where eat?	380.9822932635508
The Clarence, Dolphin.	422.58879377122736
On. For Raoul.	343.0398733869244
Eat.	206.4719438318858
If I net five guineas with those ads.	1058.9598140164665
The violet silk petticoats.	826.0401710310463
Not yet.	241.28892517597617
The sweets of sin.	338.60420358146024
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	1788.580503129818
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	1138.4167463915792
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	1327.154759633644
He strolled.	226.81939391382565
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	300.76651829215285
He held her hand.	201.63618799011982
Enjoyed her holidays?	1839.8549364183443
— Tiptop.	221.9076569734492
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	1131.6578027760202
— Gorgeous, she said.	194.23675410015713
Lying out on the strand all day.	410.94451733630814
Bronze whiteness.	926.0881397841399
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	581.4943208222386
Tempting poor simple males.	1824.4716554919319
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	1277.0752686366372
— O go away! she said.	219.84504178907216
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	323.32042349084645
He was.	55.06630463379051
— Well now I am, he mused.	274.9601190375101
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	835.7787151083979
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	727.4923817674369
And what did the doctor order today?	619.3882664902617
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	390.1498528358936
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	482.0353230801441
Jingle.	180.3698566476659
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	824.1735253375656
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	1152.8555731087417
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	1562.1187184445962
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	887.5523390958514
Alacrity she served.	896.7387042004475
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	1893.3866690597927
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	649.3579450038678
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	396.8990123793569
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	457.4784638951869
Yes.	72.08392493010007
Yes.	72.08392493010007
Yes.	72.08392493010007
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	479.8846204800156
Chips.	286.319300185858
Shreds.	412.94388766377165
Musing.	412.94388766377165
Mute.	327.7537808406544
None nought said nothing.	825.8248608862875
Yes.	72.08392493010007
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	1153.6718969669844
In came Lenehan.	273.7472972890392
Round him peered Lenehan.	685.4511682663672
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	895.0224361319837
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	526.4013662510348
To Martha I must write.	519.6982991462417
Buy paper.	509.2888581136645
Daly ’ s.	166.35491681775537
Girl there civil.	685.3338109826328
Bloom.	47.33347058841286
Old Bloom.	163.94612576008743
Blue bloom is on the rye.	640.7440018406008
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	332.64630608421936
Lenehan came forward.	352.73639409113594
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	473.6330088535968
He asked.	100.8652194823725
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	492.55499943185987
She asked.	138.092297019448
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	516.5143671380961
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	819.0330624258751
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	266.8406697101169
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	1267.8190660791875
To mind her stops.	468.12286851306874
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	951.6740219704606
Jingle jaunty jingle.	1888.3352259878873
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	660.3622594971962
Take no notice.	511.36370702617984
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	2300.9361868537553
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	4510.181248549691
He droned in vain.	521.663372302501
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	609.0475020926558
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	575.5838100928962
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	505.244582146937
— Who may he be?	286.2953652631964
Mr Dedalus asked.	202.40175295641495
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	1379.6520980647526
Who?	169.48198217090365
— Who may he be?	286.2953652631964
he asked.	81.11898566253105
Can you ask?	475.36907159227985
Dry.	412.94388766377165
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	663.362767223326
— I see, he said.	80.45341131079478
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	291.6254516086492
I hear he is keeping very select company.	814.8979838351163
Have you seen him lately?	725.7411077014573
He had.	70.2901146436969
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	423.57431685612846
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	801.4064099020343
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	1233.1321848130701
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	928.2092793106465
I see.	67.86952710487904
He see.	84.52361036846455
He drank.	161.85039162440532
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	1801.642622429319
Set down his glass.	537.3267694862935
— I see you have moved the piano.	244.92549894613987
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	930.7610196764923
— Is that a fact?	243.60275050048355
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	360.57230111653075
The real classical, you know.	315.6910474248647
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	322.68790953241296
— Is that a fact?	243.60275050048355
Mr Dedalus said.	139.450159149983
He drank and strayed away.	487.0756306186643
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	636.8954453120017
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	434.94540844187236
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	688.9532682878317
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	728.439589549877
Lager for diner.	870.5236939641967
Lager without alacrity she served.	1843.8152769536719
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	1567.7100543270121
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	763.8462270370118
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	972.1260578890192
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	1650.181791340847
Are you not happy in your home?	499.20922349458897
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	1087.637296343882
Means something, language of flow.	597.1082874528485
Was it a daisy?	604.280182239499
Innocence that is.	237.55013814145468
Respectable girl meet after mass.	1436.936594644112
Thanks awfully muchly.	1734.0829750629327
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	1462.8902408148545
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	1430.2842538397003
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	1823.6035970366897
For some man.	224.59644242086725
For Raoul.	413.33500523219413
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	1295.9059760793573
It is.	88.52918458182057
Again.	206.4719438318858
Coincidence.	241.4910504830898
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	1596.564280910935
Follow.	327.7537808406544
Risk it.	319.5232180404939
Go quick.	385.41857023665847
At four.	257.8481333983723
Near now.	261.86050280731206
Out.	141.22482304644274
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	443.25590791496234
— Aha...	77.53273495698006
I was forgetting...	85.54773978829611
Excuse...	69.11414206867397
— And four.	148.36878296201007
At four she.	280.69149345939894
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	1404.9586427592815
Bloo smi qui go.	2677.5936876895753
Ternoon.	412.94388766377165
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	655.840761857701
For men.	196.51538445690693
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	1149.8843095725103
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	390.2561436443949
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	486.3736881050456
A call again.	219.05227600029852
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	562.7609887782813
You hear?	278.75071041062733
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	1436.4435956595953
Longer in dying call.	740.5683359700805
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	1178.7570186089354
— _The bright stars fade_...	475.69811951995905
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	425.4649767102063
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	4595.1961880620975
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	510.8226743173105
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	513.68466125179
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	928.2474336977742
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	261.88326035560266
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	803.0530248766797
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	863.2881528590925
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	568.3758090494214
he asked her.	96.63719542256378
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	713.8168826731204
Like lady, ladylike.	469.50931839974004
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	1406.0930542208341
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	633.6712554685838
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	801.8545220970715
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	747.6484845022711
See me he might.	222.21420445579378
The seat he sat on: warm.	379.9767075041255
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	2434.30377450588
— _And I from thee_...	225.53128451355124
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	292.5241640143096
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	955.0900420444823
She smiled on him.	195.21690800214904
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	771.5923722229351
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	4021.881184178559
— What ’ s your cry?	241.08381337004732
Glass of bitter?	692.9689344443774
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	379.69881580298494
Not yet.	241.28892517597617
At four she.	280.69149345939894
Who said four?	350.84258791222743
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	553.6687641407241
Avoid.	412.94388766377165
Goulding a chance.	289.6550965917565
What is he doing in the Ormond?	276.52269978043665
Car waiting.	675.470162443278
Wait.	107.93485186050891
Hello.	131.45299260355975
Where off to?	206.98195217859688
Something to eat?	449.46996889374174
I too was just.	131.48231769988732
In here.	144.104911073506
What, Ormond?	228.01741936749704
Best value in Dublin.	458.03889162060153
Is that so?	236.11698649794843
Diningroom.	412.94388766377165
Sit tight there.	570.8737288487893
See, not be seen.	212.26947724846565
I think I ’ ll join you.	267.36894551798
Come on.	106.48988963715681
Richie led on.	336.76745821485986
Bloom followed bag.	395.3668242412165
Dinner fit for a prince.	679.7489894991023
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	817.0191017726324
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	815.060705871175
— Why don ’ t you grow?	413.81491488604706
asked Blazes Boylan.	443.953396005299
That is to say she.	154.99577661998768
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	4694.440305762011
He pitched a broad coin down.	778.3047410918906
Coin rang.	1024.8850003480125
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	125.37781557400568
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	841.1199892444969
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	371.41915738485915
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	471.83060482549683
Not on my own, you know.	196.73187355508517
Fancy of a friend of mine.	307.79443255258207
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	979.8788257458713
Idolores.	260.138348246505
The eastern seas.	676.6422391000494
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	891.1978446398051
Clock clacked.	1164.494185797461
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	993.8761548977449
It clanged.	445.5389009946305
Clock clacked.	1164.494185797461
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	1003.6335146294407
Look to the west.	190.5916344665934
A clack.	363.63677483853303
For me.	123.51026915878359
— What time is that?	181.04776955674137
asked Blazes Boylan.	443.953396005299
Four?	386.21212194114173
O ’ clock.	160.4191885957425
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	1518.2004676679016
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	138.31430800921913
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	1419.8841439007183
Be near.	327.42160180890056
At four.	257.8481333983723
Has he forgotten?	563.4137027004773
Perhaps a trick.	358.27625947639746
Not come: whet appetite.	1262.2477761917032
I couldn ’ t do.	182.13082139675527
Wait, wait.	170.440356099325
Pat, waiter, waited.	310.4319726074862
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	2640.956158829902
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	334.1437470620756
There ’ s no - one.	195.90057071595882
He never heard.	188.63635434046287
—...	23.343750950771124
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	1220.1022256510978
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	1206.4085574666888
— Please, please.	237.50257909584084
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	1842.6988518129317
— _I could not leave thee_...	396.42811946087414
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	1490.4288177043572
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	228.8450387948433
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	654.7958372666255
She looked.	158.17009542057662
Quick.	191.6715737888812
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	888.4422711315567
Sudden bent.	872.9447086487241
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	2055.8581779164583
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	604.6355726034751
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	908.3629623668016
Delayed.	412.94388766377165
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	864.1661206301081
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	438.4736694499642
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	3104.0959780046564
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	1229.5345585919188
Trained by owner.	836.8803857226223
No sawdust there.	395.04196174250274
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	1203.5746943758775
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	396.31576054384686
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	300.6784965560731
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	1956.185265742823
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	1617.3897941714044
Yes, bronze from anearby.	490.63742329496955
—...	23.343750950771124
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	416.6565859166522
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	1073.9841194774822
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	577.4400732633648
I wanted to tell you.	170.4409908854162
Tom Rochford...	142.71053242343305
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	324.62225335468963
Lenehan gulped to go.	537.2615994774467
— Got the horn or what?	415.9753949830531
he said.	50.91883309542916
Wait.	107.93485186050891
I ’ m coming.	149.04406320586247
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	300.9713549015523
— Eh?	259.4949541985836
How do?	259.1633305764898
How do?	259.1633305764898
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	1064.3923028380784
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	412.45857164299554
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	535.8159115992567
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	696.5444184611208
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	1215.6503500775582
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	1167.658864388748
Come on, Simon.	159.57426903458693
Give us a ditty.	513.2970001648803
We heard the piano.	270.6451618270514
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	1235.2467683887567
Power for Richie.	280.48012914320975
And Bloom?	156.63443685083286
Let me see.	201.6947959226942
Not make him walk twice.	543.9298828599085
His corns.	364.8717991427359
Four now.	267.1532882227268
How warm this black is.	410.0028964451437
Course nerves a bit.	565.4901849950218
Refracts (is it?) heat.	386.7328179212327
Let me see.	201.6947959226942
Cider.	327.7537808406544
Yes, bottle of cider.	299.6843566595212
— What ’ s that?	114.48218109093882
Mr Dedalus said.	139.450159149983
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	279.69035185894586
Begone dull care.	1295.9055979700643
Come, Bob.	172.0686640730794
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	644.9352421234562
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	579.6290089026431
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	1298.2112952572943
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	1602.965134456208
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	603.6645060465564
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	451.2871145361576
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	1136.7956263179206
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	394.5973471610882
He ’ s off.	88.7065939855301
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	1561.3783264237697
Jingling.	260.138348246505
He ’ s gone.	114.59799642106302
Jingle.	180.3698566476659
Hear.	227.25177915691472
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	287.30163918121065
God be with old times.	246.59743754636122
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	751.4045756084525
Gone.	175.62105889062306
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	964.2515889805023
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	1610.280103039896
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	850.2370838998453
There was.	90.39676969823093
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	308.9460046014858
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	439.78254137714646
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	566.0490073522222
— God, do you remember?	231.8383074004814
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	1099.5634728416196
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	1006.2664400184244
They laughed all three.	347.0589126909889
He had no wed.	299.88225860290964
All trio laughed.	1008.4511989367576
No wedding garment.	954.8475079450878
— Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	437.39855088142417
Where ’ s my pipe, by the way?	229.39796611698372
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	544.7963999864058
Bald Pat carried two diners ’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	1391.1784615358097
And Father Cowley laughed again.	593.9150470289215
— I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	248.01456542534729
— You did, averred Ben Dollard.	520.0505289721411
I remember those tight trousers too.	572.1387264360528
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	367.1848156987496
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	2380.458409224158
He saved the situa.	459.18181504583896
Tight trou.	1384.824771129642
Brilliant ide.	2167.3678953985213
— I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	135.3642288339867
The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?	869.3185282494899
Do you remember?	389.313810475284
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh ’ s gave us the number.	561.7564680023639
Remember?	343.8771686764908
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	1119.7088316057577
— By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	682.9190231025963
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	446.87458569896586
— Merrion square style.	810.5020484274427
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.	482.1883435412315
He wouldn ’ t take any money either.	545.8133501646389
What?	116.16450681686501
Any God ’ s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose.	1191.5776614227277
— Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.	366.95381474579943
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.	828.8826579131579
Jingle jaunted down the quays.	861.7633012529081
Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.	2236.0901958368995
Liver and bacon.	619.23332990721
Steak and kidney pie.	983.6405273034783
Right, sir.	156.59904656650704
Right, Pat.	207.4875680504905
Mrs Marion.	269.87291704139983
Met him pike hoses.	1291.2416640194833
Smell of burn.	518.0204334674277
Of Paul de Kock.	1499.892585854836
Nice name he.	223.26721106846816
— What ’ s this her name was?	195.00156929384946
A buxom lassy.	1614.1791022348395

Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.	2792.0127731172975
Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar.	579.726435980875
So. That will do.	196.98906306546056

Love that is singing: love ’ s old sweet song.	481.5297002020476
Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet.	1152.4133294300411
Love ’ s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	1326.291717115675
Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	1250.9836437235015

_He drink me my teas.	926.6322456153252
He eat me my sugars.	596.4366837393674
Because he no pay me my moneys? _ For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of <NUM> Saint Kevin ’ s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	1168.5503038024087
Geraghty, esquire, of <NUM> Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	1434.9021749016908
— Are you a strict <URL>.?	304.01473830979717
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	483.11498132394837
— What about paying our respects to our friend?	877.5177861913866
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Who?	160.92060442380037
says I.	64.35612612969182
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	202.9289465898481
— Drinking his own stuff?	721.2348772103412
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Ay, says I.	121.06422330283117
Whisky and water on the brain.	425.97987867957846
— Come around to Barney Kiernan ’ s, says Joe.	407.54700952047443
I want to see the citizen.	153.84337475673047
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	276.3533830051456
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	1093.041386699166
— Not a word, says Joe.	199.38633040184052
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	302.702572932965
— What was that, Joe?	146.13809367144447
says I.	64.35612612969182
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	504.9458960607796
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	268.231357156381
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	617.9163762424201
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	492.3195358971924
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	741.8208409711023
For trading without a licence, says he.	478.70430211474917
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	647.0846214730516
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	1299.8234869074063
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	1011.5527875990738
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	1209.445179950614
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	1728.1321025338716
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	2293.147640246537
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	1045.4805650599596
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	2455.2861947436595
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	2785.5581332374913
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	201.97784545612538
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	2216.2230256544326
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	549.5870105770359
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	381.2597395957437
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	630.1192632225498
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	711.3072587267957
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	601.2276825072759
— Stand and deliver, says he.	261.92765916846844
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	185.6381123159606
Friends here.	475.9545929468275
— Pass, friends, says he.	211.3183143140306
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	310.70264444300426
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	613.859506456799
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	306.2703611698742
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	372.1840705888667
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	675.6640541705284
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	535.4747715721188
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	435.21582345437236
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	473.43236259132374
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	208.3420410034401
— Wine of the country, says he.	166.10839160541266
— What ’ s yours?	233.8613291574448
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	511.1273210147553
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	394.40316461437044
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	233.5292923816155
says he.	64.45760785269151
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	510.56049217726223
What Garry?	591.976472224895
Are we going to win?	630.7901483202371
Eh?	320.48906629443826
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	395.5008362048048
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	7667.297626176475
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	2115.652833037583
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	2010.88711793907
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	710.5043618202748
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	2279.9906007422196
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	1676.4364912419387
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	2450.5457426467074
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	2852.4960699327303
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	3077.44893080089
Fursa, S.	322.49414332090146
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn ’ t, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	1209.7246799585305
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.	2011.614102378228
Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O ’ Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O ’ Sullivan Beare.	3126.1400468326083
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	3438.288158660176
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	995.146809035122
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	239.24424338878728
A goodlooking sovereign.	675.3560580896475
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	190.79808558007696
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	717.1672409401627
says I.	64.35612612969182
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	387.5106006318749
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	764.8068935401219
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	558.8157082925718
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	1475.9804407413885
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	169.14413379912853
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	559.1372770351456
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	332.39264203064477
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	378.76801881010255
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	472.9610854836496
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	637.3999559941404
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	489.91157421525793
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	1208.2563179668496
How ’ s that, eh?	183.3760842800288
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	2230.2210902938687
Eh?	320.48906629443826
Deaths.	412.94388766377165
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	1044.4845834542793
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	334.10452472082875
— Cockburn.	263.8941645464089
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	1330.4853132067285
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	577.1873230880065
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	374.35001694566137
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	307.18275945079273
Drink that, citizen.	205.1984867703507
— I will, says he, honourable person.	191.08538219050544
— Health, Joe, says I.	191.65985064652858
And all down the form.	165.28910298240618
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	541.3696260797075
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	749.3615551919003
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	984.0584024254988
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	943.1671275997667
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	695.5694140280227
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	441.93983506233695
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	1506.9470860268718
I thought Alf would split.	516.7528753282552
— Look at him, says he.	141.42656786513345
Breen.	145.20506429781227
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	655.2135310007507
p: up on it to take a li...	211.29197386871894
And he doubled up.	259.07632964524197
— Take a what?	228.79077769525088
says I.	64.35612612969182
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	566.0165684141189
— O hell! says I.	194.85080496648496
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	564.1308994094285
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	973.6843032725883
— Who?	160.92060442380037
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Breen, says Alf.	229.040359078812
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	463.0093210630788
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	320.44781067808333
U.	157.56758319468753
p: up.	180.48802002399958
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	647.1260018395753
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	664.383477047587
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	540.2629626641694
Is that Alf Bergan?	779.8630188612136
— Yes, says Alf.	169.65429981675598
Hanging?	517.0862402971059
Wait till I show you.	323.9951359560561
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	1101.8488660153655
You should have seen long John ’ s eye.	445.1107939704568
U.	157.56758319468753
p....	48.1238418654843
— Who are you laughing at?	333.6560989090108
says Bob Doran.	471.62795251004377
Is that Bergan?	525.8333340158874
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	413.8234647511643
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	2600.710916474756
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	1471.8724632287172
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	738.95198377994
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	1212.3598877173542
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	812.7824618471801
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	488.4936437088944
— What ’ s that?	114.48218109093882
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	472.74119436155104
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	502.3635264742894
Hangmen ’ s letters.	420.7109878367781
Look at here.	235.47796760061908
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	510.9708862274165
— Are you codding?	617.359884488104
says I.	64.35612612969182
— Honest injun, says Alf.	702.8921153666516
Read them.	247.82417521717989
So Joe took up the letters.	368.34106817485707
— Who are you laughing at?	333.6560989090108
says Bob Doran.	471.62795251004377
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	280.43110213382494
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	525.9592280074274
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	203.28892884484404
Only I was running after that...	154.27140125686088
— You what?	181.3935187233994
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	321.70370662214907
With who?	256.5073217986388
— With Dignam, says Alf.	263.84809509749414
— Is it Paddy?	341.90514364832416
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Yes, says Alf.	169.65429981675598
Why?	184.539251337404
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	239.5317339250786
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	522.4798384287429
— Ay, says Joe.	187.507503967714
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	689.0748612947186
— Who ’ s dead?	210.44330416545287
says Bob Doran.	471.62795251004377
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	402.3888563550016
— What?	121.21994813499828
says Alf.	172.11710949168474
Good Christ, only five...	186.49497417352484
What?...	41.69433933095181
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	272.70865970162913
What?	116.16450681686501
Dignam dead?	410.99831523385296
— What about Dignam?	288.95572325042633
says Bob Doran.	471.62795251004377
Who ’ s talking about...?	118.32345542839953
— Dead! says Alf.	343.1973184441392
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	259.0986556013435
— Maybe so, says Joe.	282.3608357811322
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	717.5237763880248
— Paddy?	228.38455482883742
says Alf.	172.11710949168474
— Ay, says Joe.	187.507503967714
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	425.44313267838714
— Good Christ! says Alf.	424.347941339437
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	748.1715796895835
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	1640.6017653715555
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	2129.6020856669097
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	1287.5989538909585
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	1073.742880120161
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	1664.574490888142
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	2165.458296896222
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	1462.823973938958
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	690.5053804507778
Mind C.	408.81409715080355
K.	167.44054250722874
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	1050.5908055422299
J.	70.96904591365316
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	750.58618136305
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	794.323744771352
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	1111.6316422686582
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	791.608126831801
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	553.5082198200267
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	765.3024640881877
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	668.6831776583065
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	208.8622837405126
— Who?	160.92060442380037
— Bloom, says he.	80.82299099767572
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	376.8843688859494
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	579.7591423109734
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	1628.6393838677066
Faith, he was.	151.51755869785424
— Good Christ! says he.	259.6851824187063
I could have sworn it was him.	279.909604355
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	474.9847979917469
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	498.5000782116664
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	702.9744159121993
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	278.5331233660109
He ’ s over all his troubles.	196.09406139887562
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	568.4701828202781
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	391.9684472242137
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	740.4398195208958
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	884.9818127704126
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	509.5877880664983
Talking through his bloody hat.	531.7037413190154
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	912.3426759682608
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	218.3237960962441
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	449.45454638739574
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	633.1452908000808
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	1112.1029173891538
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	198.06967834311882
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	614.2865994664489
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	352.0653758685549
Listen to this, will you?	247.5116579271077
And he starts reading out one.	379.8212973391268
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	1502.0352817218893
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... _ — Jesus, says I.	1184.0041090803209
— _...	31.147225248445544
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	942.6223949973294
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	1195.035997197686
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	631.392663782379
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	353.4134275839717
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	267.2016324087664
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	405.8193759669667
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	610.6445547190892
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	711.6075918329917
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	787.7671449931482
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	863.7131888083655
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	701.7796843397151
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	2311.070286167609
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	707.210092574527
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	456.42227517458537
— What ’ s that?	114.48218109093882
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	510.10916329433
— That so?	183.23801082922273
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	228.52575198510448
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	690.9145104128121
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	520.2953184432705
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	602.9722933617356
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	430.93073812743796
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	199.93264151079995
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	648.7521355046972
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	1727.3914684178856
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	604.4142652761936
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	2287.6643323005746
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	649.0934074496739
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	837.1156214486649
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	522.7909179501701
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	804.8604642336862
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	1100.0059586847426
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	678.9026520917612
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	711.5688363985091
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	892.5637122204316
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	727.7501842372234
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	444.7631673381314
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	651.8895206165188
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	505.6911006998301
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	253.16863350802555
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	398.16281351721176
What I mean is...	90.42068090118418
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	446.61443552462407
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	1256.6111177776138
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	602.8544617305135
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	2235.5912917135342
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	2349.833118913957
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	3554.3199815206262
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	4079.0822043117314
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	2602.4164918922174
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	1711.9583002634931
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	3118.893592610675
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	3473.4565840470464
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	25384.929324340323
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	2576.746910726047
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	1119.5797047493527
O.	51.15590757957263
T.	143.15965009292913
E.	132.89764665905037
I.	29.07476188802408
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	647.8173346131435
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	1647.4661372217574
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	2714.8509347783015
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	1287.1144339495554
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	1403.6767118844846
O.	51.15590757957263
T.	143.15965009292913
E.	132.89764665905037
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	446.6890886850997
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	2091.330958956703
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	2243.8965692097604
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	1821.0983261359859
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	1641.4810813613783
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	2399.3620554145186
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	893.7477381950983
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	1252.441597062119
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	1515.6199697437237
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	2006.2321368353075
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	2082.6384100625296
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	3298.139341546475
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	1736.4322891369943
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	1647.4312969038297
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	1796.510633917631
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	3046.748449143508
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	2130.636672364885
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	900.3371651975784
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	1081.1253016549053
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	836.6410793634802
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	1906.0903120969076
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	1031.7660791382223
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	1173.8055269989693
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	2146.5161855539004
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	1570.1709636819496
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	830.1865068680578
Antitreating is about the size of it.	322.62231909282605
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	634.8708716901989
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	1165.1446335439805
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	784.6619874658576
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	923.1010136416528
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	1084.9525153338093
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	758.2588860498564
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	319.3130645240875
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	692.211529016131
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	471.27128491652223
says the citizen, jeering.	237.82463330620553
— No, says I.	93.2750975046718
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	586.683846757583
So he calls the old dog over.	337.1188542194534
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	198.78668915278678
says he.	64.45760785269151
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	649.5256960742233
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	832.055314874436
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	893.9929824407486
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	720.3928873235386
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	1930.788052555047
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	1150.8588698595493
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	2373.7909804463734
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	1967.231418651648
O.	51.15590757957263
C.	96.23846299732125
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	1460.235425347114
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	2081.281235985613
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	2236.900698038392
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	1817.1659073913722
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	2079.476805236783
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	581.1089648414387
And Joe asked him would he have another.	334.2689996620829
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	433.70156448321615
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	272.0772646015782
Entertainment for man and beast.	536.7291742016266
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	623.1058998921548
— Could a swim duck?	850.0509810242365
says I.	64.35612612969182
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	310.1176906571762
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	649.7145989444057
says he.	64.45760785269151
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	156.09978846001863
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	465.914960823889
Martin asked me to go to the house.	208.58656765660496
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	532.5889756480103
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	512.962983242276
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	516.9104837335941
— Whose admirers?	1083.3093146438314
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	240.49125222358953
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	597.9976413496793
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	2498.7968708016324
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	1425.8468643655638
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	712.1965205160773
Choking with bloody foolery.	1319.6841882720043
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	415.23186332906903
Shake hands, brother.	421.87644982906323
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	299.7244989275677
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	801.076778224105
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	916.1755046930717
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	862.7779042517944
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	288.3247173909165
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	1148.8852276505127
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	341.72755778616306
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	933.3172006105785
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	973.8524994054623
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	1032.9789196202676
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	737.3196348404217
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	639.8647638877441
_How is your testament?	1458.2921809445547
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	567.9510507014925
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	502.3336071176045
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	490.2996644075607
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	795.9204575163157
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	504.8299228719984
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	494.6753808896401
So Terry brought the three pints.	766.6376730122843
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	299.5959834510241
Here, citizen.	151.88350675900614
— _Slan leat_, says he.	469.0752202107552
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	191.65985064652858
Good health, citizen.	329.4499227907762
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	489.7638420887208
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	733.2718330774624
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	458.35401627599185
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	388.4626364293507
— Nannan?	422.0884103782564
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
The mimber?	664.9579021043498
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	445.72619765352204
— I thought so, says Joe.	180.80781067377376
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	454.7958653614017
P., the cattle traders.	248.32009573994293
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	587.3369449040254
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	1022.8540644413306
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	377.7433502398943
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	793.4426362773553
Mister Knowall.	2167.3678953985213
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	1924.225066273049
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	794.9532575522428
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	1208.78617115904
What ’ s your programme today?	461.03998643230295
Ay. Humane methods.	831.9917463780002
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	1175.9089500911377
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	400.4456503529265
Klook Klook Klook.	1568.2384102526466
Black Liz is our hen.	1499.1225197688584
She lays eggs for us.	659.9882862352684
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	843.332150358844
Gara.	286.319300185858
Klook Klook Klook.	1568.2384102526466
Then comes good uncle Leo.	1163.8847147915205
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	1042.7335662521025
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	9751.236340697676
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	314.76001618489823
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	229.41397849019074
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	257.57833677432177
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	180.93434703072498
I wanted particularly.	322.114903549503
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	762.0353713150437
I couldn ’ t phone.	358.4331271642989
No. You ’ re sure?	276.8833644726247
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	291.58532215943455
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	1060.0100416048597
What do you think of that, citizen?	219.01648231545033
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	5092.024329496209
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	2043.365018502601
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	1514.0584274170371
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	991.3622472622296
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	849.0150089483815
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	848.7638594331542
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	442.93766146731764
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	1231.3482657377228
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	1629.0859306850664
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	2129.929013380971
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	404.29559309432193
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	1112.7664986785448
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	620.2416043682318
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	1336.3054769563312
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	401.11921538765586
There he is sitting there.	238.0913798514402
The man that got away James Stephens.	599.3171949707333
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	826.8105504660945
What was your best throw, citizen?	432.4409432247576
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	610.3267277975066
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	304.43148930324384
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	241.5274028170429
You were and a bloody sight better.	333.8279147577639
— Is that really a fact?	374.7624843116782
says Alf.	172.11710949168474
— Yes, says Bloom.	119.16237469953565
Did you not know that?	274.33198871404113
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	956.1172614625164
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	552.9356424985397
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	489.45845625903905
Do you see that straw?	428.1956590740379
That ’ s a straw_.	233.87733203102027
Declare to my aunt he ’ d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	703.8248762068952
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	1772.3421146773903
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	609.4650376691604
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	1796.899867077011
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	1735.5169155579963
L.	135.98939187633997
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	2281.7962000726807
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	1681.8907380690844
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	2155.9479190931856
The proceedings then terminated.	917.4279404372026

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	1085.7117608727551
— No, says Joe.	144.46696338766458
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	516.5165976711071
— Who?	160.92060442380037
Blazes?	270.31094738478697
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	436.894387169943
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	247.66102856431007
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	451.81716010136654
— We know him, says the citizen.	167.0454910473924
The traitor ’ s son.	294.91036897946157
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	524.6676006187711
— True for you, says Joe.	223.46233577463704
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	596.9626294352383
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	585.5139494555862
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	322.82171535092317
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	675.0410277774828
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	618.0033848338117
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	1133.2604678290338
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	1228.7385799501021
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	1387.1610368004715
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	2009.2063510561825
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	1073.439261510012
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	935.6090560062919
The men came to handigrips.	471.0867401765406
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	1220.5205301191406
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	1389.0820009941729
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	238.8718033033297
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	1744.1907026638896
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	2246.4977960229435
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	1529.0986787066427
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	2647.5343730076293
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	499.92026967818384
— He is, says Joe.	126.40500552110169
Isn ’ t he?	245.91974945386096
— Who?	160.92060442380037
says Bloom.	92.75322757919479
Ah, yes.	134.47252670409566
That ’ s quite true.	251.78525954449978
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	245.62562693329494
Just a holiday.	354.95831505518345
— Mrs B.	215.36768719446158
is the bright particular star, isn ’ t she?	487.6855019892479
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— My wife?	293.6587229583152
says Bloom.	92.75322757919479
She ’ s singing, yes.	171.4580977659976
I think it will be a success too.	294.85911775266146
He ’ s an excellent man to organise.	396.8364547517914

J.	70.96904591365316
What ’ ll it be, Ned?	214.09656476828076
— Half one, says Ned.	259.95440269704926
So J.	184.3415122409437
J.	70.96904591365316

— Were you round at the court?	345.6235140580715
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Yes, says J.	141.75067263882033
He ’ ll square that, Ned, says he.	179.90518000505668
— Hope so, says Ned.	274.82003670191534

Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no - one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop.	861.5582486806729
What ’ s your name, sir?	200.39406093391798
Dunne, says he.	181.88038825861534
Ay, and done says I.	167.58906254698093
Gob, he ’ ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I ’ m thinking.	472.23731265460174
— Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?	802.6254154515365
says Alf.	172.11710949168474
U.	157.56758319468753

— Ay, says Ned.	208.38432914239942
And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	984.8871204021254
— Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	500.6150509064728
God, I ’ d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	425.67736049766
— Was it you did it, Alf?	255.74885142202143
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	617.2595398995143
— Me?	262.67953710966145
says Alf.	172.11710949168474
Don ’ t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	839.3323176639727
— Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	602.9256868923013
— Of course an action would lie, says J.	558.4425215457226
J.	70.96904591365316
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	1274.9613148539963
U.	157.56758319468753
p: up.	180.48802002399958
_ — Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	507.42169974777477
Do you know that he ’ s balmy?	334.40971962028664
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	484.9178376049544
— Yes, says J.	141.75067263882033
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	421.18469254781303
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	416.05158654212363
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	217.97095751313316
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	207.06620671005106
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	678.3482918481425
— How half and half?	316.461246725598
says Bloom.	92.75322757919479
Do you mean he...	108.42840994254364
— Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	249.31011814168562
A fellow that ’ s neither fish nor flesh.	606.6104696543376
— Nor good red herring, says Joe.	743.6133100908024
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	286.97178277983693
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	619.5904798874398
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	763.6240038215828
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	906.1393401817792
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’ s was pewopener to the pope.	582.9492012747689
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’ s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	1067.052772456267
And who was he, tell us?	220.0943907497527
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	772.3556783514639
— And moreover, says J.	325.17075912408967
J., a postcard is publication.	265.6013022658256
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	1509.588545120268
Hole.	412.94388766377165
In my opinion an action might lie.	983.073580894684
Six and eightpence, please.	431.99928655178934
Who wants your opinion?	947.6269242557468
Let us drink our pints in peace.	948.0211381089152
Gob, we won ’ t be let even do that much itself.	523.7889851312951
— Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	302.4392691632084
— Good health, Ned, says J.	296.97756093810557
J.	70.96904591365316
— - There he is again, says Joe.	232.38578189042937
— Where?	170.37824104574764
says Alf.	172.11710949168474
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	604.5746573175815
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	1087.8493102575408
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Remanded, says J.	299.50551319751827
J.	70.96904591365316
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	1531.9757168495946
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	367.32011023439554
Course it was a bloody barney.	561.1197440747027
What?	116.16450681686501
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	827.3266426634774
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	868.6100956207147
— Who tried the case?	368.8765477808301
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Recorder, says Ned.	351.68998406610365
— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	410.02104337354933
— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	435.9530484357828
— Ay, says Alf.	212.3976072982492
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	1035.4722900359563
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	1203.829275860511
Ten, did you say?	287.5153279001002
— Yes, your worship.	225.33652948338118
And my wife has the typhoid.	403.9156054546223
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	875.3394926874302
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	334.5596043272973
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	740.3537030827481
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	729.8887559502064
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	1540.2662444084349
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	737.1791518222892
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	470.6181386116081
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	459.76546539750643
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	1148.2399785113328
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	708.6991078869663
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	1666.9251367353506
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	1201.1016660121459
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	621.5507857097347
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	661.2592882484807
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	373.3067772388451
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	354.9562073172757
That ’ s the whole secret.	207.369961523343
— Rely on me, says Joe.	297.8294279152326
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	246.5657639768258
We want no more strangers in our house.	643.4751737754642
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	230.35934557245355
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	209.24615145645345
— Consider that done, says Joe.	386.0505229986805
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	190.7295088565554
— The strangers, says the citizen.	206.0867964884536
Our own fault.	553.7804262817126
We let them come in.	251.14410148948528
We brought them in.	199.7744065749285
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	1305.5650525130102
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	591.9483215434597
J.	70.96904591365316
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	566.3013125727342
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	303.34296481693445
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	530.6049340654888

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	803.9251501253032
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	541.8355683654194
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	291.86208942525616
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	1473.9263926980473
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	1084.3418066843262
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	159.41725304511047
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	911.435149210538
J.	70.96904591365316
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	986.0888695092902
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	333.1574993791349
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	891.7436469531093
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	1097.2377469497662
Tonguetied sons of bastards ’ ghosts.	1564.3731384838393
— The European family, says J.	380.725137670733
J....	32.58928659339964
— They ’ re not European, says the citizen.	296.11843996854174
I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	498.0065153007483
You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	1056.4934007117656
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	1712.2741356965519
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	135.55780810199585
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	471.21824939967723
— Gold cup, says he.	224.05992968889396
— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	318.81218027669723
says Terry.	222.6453103262402
_ — Throwaway, _ says he, at twenty to one.	212.92586337566888
A rank outsider.	690.1319161822033

_Throwaway, _ says he.	203.20224189909274

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	4026.1956322874253
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	6690.673146770232
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	1724.522281662769
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	2043.7832358162784
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	1351.4344629193386
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	3069.063569779016
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	1854.90355658051
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	287.80390887712525
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	1158.3842897099998
— And will again, says Joe.	212.65959616206726
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	335.28185364958944
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	1252.728331481693
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	826.9553724996457
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	335.98232641631324

Cows in Connacht have long horns.	1401.6502076117008
As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren ’ t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.	1145.4185745455243
What will you have?	234.44250285150022
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	771.6392916505398
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	275.94325428060074
Terry! Are you asleep?	795.0534044282015
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	192.53542405826917
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	1187.0710742768213
Right, sir.	156.59904656650704
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public.	1226.8061505654573
Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate.	658.9653940402463
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him.	1234.813753324812
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	578.6604832478458
— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	806.0274798727886
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	187.45671321960748
Hell upon earth it is.	474.55262453298354
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	808.2260363991517
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	2104.816179260435
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	1120.5006661918517
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	774.7373394317985
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	724.4220343213464
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	1022.3807141977387
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	472.46230855980656
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	648.0003601546604
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	1043.0023418375927
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	379.18814233310724
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	182.4792724755561
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	979.3602694045229
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	1220.2773804792553
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	394.4843634641892
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	649.8834561707037
Didn ’ t I tell you?	316.7999469585737
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	780.3302349376143
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	461.8987695124842
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	744.3254526170489
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	338.5450095043576
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	1687.2616852974388
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	1902.243105748597
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	1588.2384000046716
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	590.8902534180328
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	605.8148618955314
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	316.65866309874815
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	880.1549083530383
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	326.4059668521159
But my point was...	110.61357766307859
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	314.8981208405624
— Ay, says John Wyse.	296.50786788799155
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	1486.149998258028
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	1131.2168959712499
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	813.6454958663788
Fontenoy, eh?	684.2268949029144
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	1427.5399765458797
But what did we ever get for it?	413.6722700890717
— The French! says the citizen.	216.58918310067486
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	766.58667399578
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	975.7235056614181
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	1492.7403180659253
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	804.8452215222384
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	815.5629237244425
— Well, says J.	156.7447383937372
J.	70.96904591365316
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	654.0335845696958
— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	190.1529795948793
Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	1049.802600360222
The earl of Dublin, no less.	317.95642766464607
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	472.1274555972048
And says J.	170.53566598752698
J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	1070.2007509176349
— Will you try another, citizen?	456.8745380205582
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Yes, sir, says he.	110.98101809962382
I will.	71.85004074211733
— You?	132.17371373895742
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	185.930795853284
May your shadow never grow less.	1228.5700581957797
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	529.7429140300011
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	203.99553418488856
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	4710.282782027889
— But do you know what a nation means?	493.04687559393005
says John Wyse.	306.13129049261636
— Yes, says Bloom.	119.16237469953565
— What is it?	140.8458157135941
says John Wyse.	306.13129049261636
— A nation?	304.71799609621837
says Bloom.	92.75322757919479
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	416.2029954792816
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	312.3194432854616
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	519.061793755741
— What is your nation if I may ask?	575.9563151362087
says the citizen.	106.46763776483836
— Ireland, says Bloom.	133.47120058915442
Ireland.	93.91855460734249
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	632.8886685081916
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	414.9642594370513
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	215.9986752411938
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	556.4408819716413
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	3960.636188600162
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	1389.1175260467705
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	2006.9398350145393
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	1592.4500528655233
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	1094.426211661569
— Show us over the drink, says I.	238.74863092807468
Which is which?	338.6746586595295
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	263.68920891854265
Also now.	232.27422079831092
This very moment.	372.98960753549346
This very instant.	445.4171222166015
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	507.23709619170717
— Robbed, says he.	204.50399044211548
Plundered.	412.94388766377165
Insulted.	412.94388766377165
Persecuted.	412.94388766377165
Taking what belongs to us by right.	628.8500453463002
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	900.2951728114449
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	572.9022754004146
says the citizen.	106.46763776483836
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	354.9741049341579
— Right, says John Wyse.	315.05972717679543
Stand up to it then with force like men.	433.3708699485424
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	397.68837635163237
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	1166.202605598036
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	696.1072434695936
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	399.63525651116544
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	596.9552570490637
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	169.47499161765865
Force, hatred, history, all that.	348.1951466269058
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	395.46064527956224
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	333.15066145220624
— What?	121.21994813499828
says Alf.	172.11710949168474
— Love, says Bloom.	154.1583919824211
I mean the opposite of hatred.	313.1305023564552
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	267.1192749957233
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	337.69421728986214
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	332.8193951620088
Just a moment.	192.6218578277614
Who ’ s hindering you?	428.74232337243234
And off he pops like greased lightning.	1286.206020959182
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	369.2735590845997
Universal love.	537.6896221041155
— Well, says John Wyse.	265.9860923686157
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	348.2319251332748
Love your neighbour.	510.00161071130316
— That chap?	291.96897482900727
says the citizen.	106.46763776483836
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	905.6674991114681
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	676.6315888195438
Love loves to love love.	559.1684757026682
Nurse loves the new chemist.	1062.6122601914255
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	1438.711428445744
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	641.0649679424379
M.	83.95412797466348
B.	119.75576330508032

Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	1716.725274948711
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	510.8872129433748
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	1025.0769832367414
Mrs Norman W.	809.9333067584147
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	2991.4191215399937
You love a certain person.	388.8242090817454
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	1939.559365184252
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	288.59523605520985
More power, citizen.	377.4290535625335
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	218.21867503303693
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	581.9561511043179
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	645.4895451975783
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	1514.0112888252036
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	1595.602233160544
— What ’ s that?	114.48218109093882
says Joe.	138.38685868272879
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	1575.7464227974067
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	1416.7445323051284
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	1985.096367715062
— Widow woman, says Ned.	372.38080738975754
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	269.18322294494067
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	409.90981904672077
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	349.26497276940313
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	3178.737979318277
— Is that by Griffith?	411.16848204735265
says John Wyse.	306.13129049261636
— No, says the citizen.	121.97225754497472
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	572.5328434066645
It ’ s only initialled: P.	384.64433678660225
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	335.24361003961087
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	206.27711835730568
Trade follows the flag.	1002.4695576305548
— Well, says J.	156.7447383937372
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	1013.5880783427918
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	379.55722089906203
— Casement, says the citizen.	242.23560755586576
He ’ s an Irishman.	191.16400788769118
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	113.5031449618281
J.	70.96904591365316
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	697.0013209300627
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	289.9545842489834
— Who?	160.92060442380037
says I.	64.35612612969182
— Bloom, says he.	80.82299099767572
The courthouse is a blind.	350.41559011481957
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	469.3756898685648
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	1110.4375366025843
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	441.70087846948655
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	190.80265309807623
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	514.5778657637916
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	168.56574151484898
A dark horse.	286.7754902725052
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	272.6277665421931
— Mind, Joe, says I.	160.27574769495422
Show us the entrance out.	424.75360687994265
— There you are, says Terry.	228.51970923653084
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	697.1102486430417
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	886.176805045187
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	1265.804295233145
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	1506.1853863274948
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	834.6106331489898
Give us a bloody chance.	488.4120797632769
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	689.9327722586333
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	718.3023646183719
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	1256.1770670196488
Loans by post on easy terms.	1461.0954441399513
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	795.2488122773312
Distance no object.	849.2223779587353
No security.	417.5403787478917
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	522.0360736893048
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	203.9603020935561
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	242.17186434295166
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	1037.9980572340776
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	2915.7646451181367
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	518.3013872009625
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	1791.445911663361
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	1069.0604856231269
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	599.5672078790459
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	1140.9799284845924
Look to our steeds.	553.3720952927191
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	608.9492462511087
I know not what to offer your lordships.	527.3086835544718
— How now, fellow?	224.55855160846127
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	739.4311930960655
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	1494.159458648375
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	550.323110513499
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	788.5623864738138
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	961.1497096433394
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	760.2732170955559
Hast aught to give us?	1210.8674508196677
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	1362.7258656503031
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	702.3196875508442
That likes me well.	383.689474821284
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	641.8044123083588
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	975.4525841874074
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	507.27011892955085
— Where is he?	168.21299323088348
says Lenehan.	148.89189272914004
Defrauding widows and orphans.	1870.2660170714064
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	436.5734796436731
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	155.36449458442462
Or so they allege.	663.487715409085
— I, says Joe.	101.4935982779396
I ’ m the alligator.	203.79629035875897
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	454.0198591509131
— Why not?	204.5248573103138
says J.	125.67662061289612
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	560.8487828851415
says Ned.	166.46619672048197
Or who is he?	249.53988025720594
No offence, Crofton.	504.00070976024705
— Who is Junius?	609.6152180076343
says J.	125.67662061289612
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	674.7676067661355
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	453.66596372665435
We know that in the castle.	190.21873214189156
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	361.04549922576774
says Jack Power.	357.86197792778216
— Not at all, says Martin.	188.64664409409775
Only namesakes.	904.2825514929508
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	346.59995390856653
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	332.33151960781703
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	290.73227531138747
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	682.4116756743194
For that matter so are we.	345.36554809589705
— Yes, says J.	141.75067263882033
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	376.3616863833298
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	377.13353863680396
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	555.1373791252867
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	318.11052740151337
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	1087.939818964267
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	2015.9765453114435
J.	70.96904591365316
— Do you call that a man?	252.50328360472855
says the citizen.	106.46763776483836
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	303.8623997963051
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	542.971832694191
— And who does he suspect?	495.4878369162382
says the citizen.	106.46763776483836
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	526.2992109051777
One of those mixed middlings he is.	565.4016475821986
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	1023.6822063268175
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	384.2432145925433
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	283.28379237673016
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	738.8799886181171
Give us your blessing.	624.2505507983574
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	327.97232729611284
But where is he?	221.1275345586505
We can ’ t wait.	281.5090722212449
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	372.69293989969754
That ’ s what he is.	118.00861679559857
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	892.4023125554419
Cursed by God.	488.2149185595963
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	522.9158658062922
says Ned.	166.46619672048197
— Only one, says Martin.	224.02444385400256
We must be quick.	377.1652049285027
J.	70.96904591365316
J.	70.96904591365316
and S.	72.38489218043627
— You, Jack?	189.85529390128352
Crofton?	462.2252181513761
Three half ones, Terry.	598.6393034203887
— Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	1033.6730878819044
— Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	359.1905896111309
God bless all here is my prayer.	618.3530657553695
— Amen, says the citizen.	177.5580337616096

And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	1346.055624352899

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.	1456.2489081879964
And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	1648.0234010014735
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	2501.384345636364
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	809.2635238513807
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	1006.3604911234759
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	554.4069775463893
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	8984.33423151489
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	532.2791193523656
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	459.93479421296604
And butter for fish.	401.7427687323649
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	566.8598010363701
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	210.10275166555408
I hope I ’ m not...	109.78732466390672
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	265.531777577173
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	852.9579750090055
Mean bloody scut.	2069.8711660383688
Stand us a drink itself.	591.5431854940525
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	461.97379042368203
Cute as a shithouse rat.	1325.92834596591
Hundred to five.	369.29537496229335
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	289.32727300606234
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	379.9211177237346
Come along now.	287.2761775983349
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	359.4156081793993
It ’ s a secret.	146.24025137509705
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	635.342081626614
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	550.4915027449472
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	455.2484870795429
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	236.73713125901367
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	1553.969701248623
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	1538.6746581025407
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	878.1504584150081
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	655.7842805783027
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	678.8286088517289
— Let me alone, says he.	202.98454710919066
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	729.0291863133336
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	826.2354640817916
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	443.0781808828514
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	786.8447644213124
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	266.50773564452084
Your God.	226.15098998753166
— He had no father, says Martin.	216.00791769044685
That ’ ll do now.	214.20275392866662
Drive ahead.	1218.8005344734222
— Whose God?	485.1699350727137
says the citizen.	106.46763776483836
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	195.30302466405593
Your God was a jew.	297.1611899125379
Christ was a jew like me.	273.7060551976088
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	455.8912817993948
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	566.9746922996679
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	387.9869913005439
Give us that biscuitbox here.	743.1844273278738
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	448.7090737066907
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	1797.32601126463
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	1647.5031289522583
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	2189.8682301694753
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	1399.2622462214968
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	1779.427277030698
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	2075.769043136522
And Ned and J.	192.00423124899822
J.	70.96904591365316
paralysed with the laughing.	283.20382617138745
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	330.8680786145484
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	377.986256688421
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	214.63935573102708
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	807.17880724696
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	322.7282134904892
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	641.8921401905707
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	930.7770409437258
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	878.6566874667761
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	1152.685623634264
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	1843.4374697927437
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	1101.3044445176145
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	2311.250604617028
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	1584.662175879019
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	4413.392357570391
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	2325.744840827847
The work of salvage, removal of _débris, _ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, <NUM> Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	1683.8975528410049

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he ’ d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	809.0275940335769
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	1229.6040527780756
What?	116.16450681686501
O, Jesus, he did.	122.47516842146499
And he let a volley of oaths after him.	454.4397278727715
— Did I kill him, says he, or what?	247.43527116205726
And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	733.3384437529553
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	299.8801411346923
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	899.4877375184202
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	771.0894483522682
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	1223.0406805651503
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	1222.5496338959758
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	951.8115363431685
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	793.9582646408221
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	1318.7635357032702

For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	1610.8920780303072
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	868.1729641130476
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	1446.4699632373095
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	965.018268243903
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	1037.325850891273
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	321.5832377080925
Say out big, big.	302.53606117454143
I want a drink of water.	197.1735902332898
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	1210.148078648656
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	1462.1767878473497
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	943.9833122629107
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	1808.55363503481
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	923.4993472870378
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	875.3605372599579
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	1064.2657488845498
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	1327.4869391793982
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	1197.8682685468991
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	1190.584951908794
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	549.3045200056482
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	557.836822377262
Wait till I catch you for that.	297.4817146597036
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	1012.193577505293
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	496.4222683338022
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	1003.4887818864144
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	818.2501058686191
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	980.5266922531798
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	808.1715844811014
Butter and cream?	776.4813306878807
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	1066.7438895482146
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	682.0346370932909
Cissy queried.	477.6295323528207
— Nao, Tommy said.	284.10891481700577
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	981.9706656437476
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	332.22847680490327
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	415.5963866145096
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	431.0161641257191
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	985.1095430087589
But who was Gerty?	357.3029186534521
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	927.1532640793201
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	727.5927326653629
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	1275.4833668630943
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	2215.1528469733466
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	1574.536028717246
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	694.1907044473394
No. Honour where honour is due.	677.1231222443729
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	2732.002365371974
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	1463.040003027999
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	936.3194467794326
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	902.325187325812
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	1093.5999358626902
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	1589.782631382567
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	1304.532735475821
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	1208.7479645460903
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	691.398139578745
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	924.9022119297417
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	406.64300251493347
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	1031.9937435766603
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	1154.3604845038724
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	1011.6066500939803
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	624.5160141102898
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	928.7629842271515
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	816.7266956039939
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	729.9049409715182
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	662.8249000778798
E.	132.89764665905037
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	1444.8346023469092
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	1117.0864934582896
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	466.97668291115116
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	850.0991298124436
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	607.2811027166481
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	752.8077958950038
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	1860.2919221569248
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	1700.1724709387702
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	1114.0070480060454
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	581.636007793259
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	1704.3281736320678
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	3681.142762193548
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	1095.2737463842984
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	1502.3028719350839
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	763.9274452892911
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	695.7625401536893
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	912.3674446318652
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	191.30971229896812
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	1374.3833592304766
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	1005.6669864740027
C.	96.23846299732125
D.	128.74184503718442
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	1293.243968569044
He was too young to understand.	233.08453988182
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	314.81715547573003
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	610.2809096843789
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	603.3403636717306
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	1404.488180328454
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	514.0926052855139
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	935.9179067640598
It would be like heaven.	322.83958701184866
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	1517.3235448711775
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	616.2602043694634
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	758.1254651632869
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	745.0603400187932
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	1149.26747402261
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	1621.0575544531555
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	622.064671469673
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	521.1573823559625
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	462.6030369826246
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	311.237685437331
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	421.9028713265311
It ’ s my ball.	193.3543093169206
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	778.3476550526059
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	625.217660472049
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	728.4794156634166
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	1040.4195006124928
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	226.02547198198556
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	816.043769574735
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	936.4603141837565
But not a pin cared Ciss.	901.4446736248028
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	591.2653020535325
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	316.0079059800208
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	2638.031956894385
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	316.716834169255
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	892.785472757817
That was just like Cissycums.	515.2390576048655
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	621.4428170304708
There was none to come up to her for fun.	326.5150183540413
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	820.4535706001345
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	519.9376972553764
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	794.2402169396705
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	601.9728906069993
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	1068.4749013322396
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	1032.4484168221518
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	1097.583960352023
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	2368.647103946141
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	711.1458102098222
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	1136.9655977101095
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	1047.3385266180555
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	657.3710119121597
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	1496.0665399215354
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	637.032653239189
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	413.603406621016
Now he was laid to rest.	291.1324823573795
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	671.1071679149801
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	796.9278637522931
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	1194.7825771300666
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	471.987637193132
You could see there was a story behind it.	322.49459337966675
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	711.2512701094786
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	1276.7700964995827
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	1570.6338676034143
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	1074.1476053295328
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	1465.770628102305
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	947.454165099606
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	696.794783469324
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	1016.4562911546234
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	893.7446765560169
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	820.8801217531126
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	1088.481929298219
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	1270.9881194158447
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	1553.6330021691363
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	1626.2903526002472
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	689.7518926836096
— Say papa, baby.	419.44388839474635
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	4937.931902140703
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	571.3246103297774
— Haja ja ja haja.	4967.3305132639525
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	1062.7390223661273
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	1469.6659310889343
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	774.9786321394098
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	624.2820004117964
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	552.6880917035855
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	967.431810840964
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	186.65104906896403
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	614.6750462982424
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	994.5085142265018
People were so queer.	606.1262395681171
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	886.3369377328162
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	354.77949244970335
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	432.1755948030002
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	632.2726897094796
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	844.5655568330625
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	421.91202980240627
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	657.5963435483019
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	623.6157097885205
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	1090.3092265781531
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	1533.9902860359246
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	748.5565674997716
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	729.1676438770419
Refuge of sinners.	978.11324366434
Comfortress of the afflicted.	439.7014831224391
_Ora pro nobis_.	3219.2269381622937
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	1125.5661349413838
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	739.4146621380469
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	968.9329367041776
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	580.9703153442606
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	802.4968864718354
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	1040.5799801223397
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	2237.8250069730598
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	467.06020819166037
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	659.1333899851055
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	583.080214686936
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	724.4336195396875
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	803.7445830416524
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	1138.5337369506576
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	743.1257764623542
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	991.6835103889242
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	546.7159613615546
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	840.2900302512032
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	1042.0348278784493
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	452.34098414893555
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	1051.002720723799
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	969.5203935209403
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	701.9714264305131
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	767.1896595692758
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	939.8330227434717
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	791.2368202434624
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	370.5302535464512
— What?	121.21994813499828
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	881.6430467173835
I was only wondering was it late.	354.1073114041469
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	968.9096177123831
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	533.8875799844777
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	506.4902943595676
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	463.57781377912147
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	451.2333800768588
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	1175.6000480463886
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	837.4906027017014
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	612.2618451815579
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	906.4541011383188
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	546.5560274108078
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	747.281859611902
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	414.4040015074039
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	621.8019667304197
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	1521.83703530023
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	558.3705661044705
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	241.10303937517847
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	1022.0163276405233
Gerty winced sharply.	1885.723410696118
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	2146.1207720501097
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	911.8590271785506
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	1172.9330470052876
She had loved him better than he knew.	463.3575840443706
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	830.3767502734283
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	1454.6386089788548
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	484.6307709963828
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	521.5491606339026
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	1185.9894234429748
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	364.19733088567045
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	943.0980966853905
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	908.9244437386426
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	834.4556942177867
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	885.3494339189625
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	989.274430786017
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	1445.873246842386
He has his bib destroyed.	653.3096080731341
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	1493.465119014743
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	1089.3722147456429
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	974.4560267281039
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	1625.7925903777693
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	504.49670931457376
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	1055.802141518514
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	1118.3815555886567
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	1027.88502346137
But it must end, she felt.	298.09061335451344
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	623.6302073445928
Love laughs at locksmiths.	1306.9169423672506
She would make the great sacrifice.	471.77779615905166
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	868.0136898654736
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	700.6509201647668
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	606.1660972860985
But even if — what then?	378.15093176710155
Would it make a very great difference?	783.9181720832717
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	2704.393661742654
No, no: not that.	115.16248549363151
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	746.8923063765011
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	589.1529335886731
She thought she understood.	413.6508482686146
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	638.5294384672935
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	621.8379206073182
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	340.24436925278866
Nothing else mattered.	1408.3632215821785
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	600.9706683559855
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	1144.9708260165273
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	320.3789776780802
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	593.8435138866436
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	247.1646346521379
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	297.5727685599515
But Gerty was adamant.	651.2624073945738
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	581.3425950053501
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	726.0180069241391
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	1273.8174257585429
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	325.9750687805898
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	398.60564213869577
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	779.9580866816158
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	547.2361212950196
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	892.5037130840946
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	649.110273112925
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	858.312878097781
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	493.9146401991341
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	777.9812863445703
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	717.9308864798775
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	922.8878493647823
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	1100.5742844127096
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	452.78967479369334
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	643.4953256878882
What a brute he had been! At it again?	438.0150495989651
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	482.4429607029256
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	826.2151943840325
Should a girl tell?	754.346219380102
No, a thousand times no.	241.94014881315888
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	759.9981208541864
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	699.207040215532
Come on.	106.48988963715681
We can see from farther up.	429.4068942526367
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	421.4525597573356
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	804.5759160084893
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	220.1993540718817
She rose.	182.25091128398316
Was it goodbye?	601.5776644195396
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	411.58944320212885
She drew herself up to her full height.	611.2293580125207
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	1003.961289821566
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	856.5348353965162
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	752.8807419649339
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	846.5198070604272
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	638.6084562393552
Tight boots?	912.8311314583278
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	496.4465936185574
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	418.5200855869227
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	588.0389058367277
Jilted beauty.	851.3738632039496
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	682.3313979216209
But makes them polite.	615.6315492848314
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	377.55776950139585
Hot little devil all the same.	453.37787351066663
I wouldn ’ t mind.	221.00318136676955
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	765.3004623925638
That squinty one is delicate.	748.2939953687934
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	1069.7416308772451
I have such a bad headache today.	531.25423507893
Where did I put the letter?	321.0974123563257
Yes, all right.	121.98540984506324
All kinds of crazy longings.	1417.377666114997
Licking pennies.	1251.3304378412884
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	1788.4785927915752
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	548.0948912898983
How many women in Dublin have it today?	596.0892542225429
Martha, she.	121.55289072185043
Something in the air.	157.417365960249
That ’ s the moon.	122.43749941920055
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	548.1341869190522
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	414.90038827587097
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	796.981275600464
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	787.6461657430489
Anyhow I got the best of that.	215.47552046397095
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	754.1138548958288
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	721.4263937385348
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	975.9120513150309
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	592.0964657517912
Thankful for small mercies.	1824.2957434536577
Yours for the asking.	348.5676338029679
Because they want it themselves.	397.61254110889627
Their natural craving.	1355.3368114497446
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	927.0751364197399
Reserve better.	696.0664036432205
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	301.3481841278096
Catch em alive, O.	770.718886602479
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	456.9472837275445
A dream of wellfilled hose.	1012.1856404676562
Where was that?	165.86369463306684
Ah, yes.	134.47252670409566
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	963.2543940703455
Peeping Tom.	659.0011471106519
Willy ’ s hat and what the girls did with it.	253.42437100847337
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	835.9730956096695
_Lingerie_ does it.	514.0497381378519
Felt for the curves inside her <URL> Excites them also when they ’ re.	895.2057043875506
I ’ m all clean come and dirty me.	331.0408030868028
Milly delighted with Molly ’ s new blouse.	705.0774561079402
At first.	198.07316350253043
Put them all on to take them all off.	317.1808773531375
Molly.	100.67956842369696
Why I bought her the violet garters.	500.55953284851205
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	815.0480522983896
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	517.6451280391944
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	913.3691108883111
of jet.	137.46735387834394
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	1012.5367089218493
Pinned together.	675.470162443278
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	296.5992933239581
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	647.2789921616898
Fashion part of their charm.	795.9736147153776
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	424.46903148312975
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	494.9601319911659
No reasonable offer refused.	2303.101759631626
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	409.36693943227937
Always off to a fellow when they are.	300.7706622687616
They never forget an appointment.	850.1593496950209
Out on spec probably.	1088.6938329289246
They believe in chance because like themselves.	591.4067730798758
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	687.997967742533
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	1239.4467796701647
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	1085.9994181128195
Barbed wire.	1251.3304378412884
Be sure now and write to me.	353.91839502381265
Now won ’ t you?	334.6169760407019
Molly and Josie Powell.	706.209464450045
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	864.5809387953383
_Tableau! _ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	326.88573271783054
What have you been doing with yourself?	505.3662511290702
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	269.18481096353923
Picking holes in each other ’ s appearance.	817.20380035565
You ’ re looking splendid.	449.4888373792955
Sister souls.	550.655302475467
Showing their teeth at one another.	697.3134415941614
How many have you left?	460.7591697696905
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	888.6520783599195
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	376.31090328039096
Dark devilish appearance.	2377.657603484067
Scratch the sole of my foot.	487.49039405846526
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	339.74059370776814
Good to rest once in a way.	257.63799061082
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	272.0314509805626
Safe in one way.	274.22960842084984
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	1940.9555870263691
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	828.8013251984075
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	853.1031051287902
Daresay she felt I.	403.6346959240489
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	528.1047277187132
Liked me or what?	621.8966424624228
Dress they look at.	419.2311969140829
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	1221.570180303101
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	789.0685644941889
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	1579.833258249571
Trousers?	517.0862402971059
Suppose I when I was?	241.01539332720893
No. Gently does it.	320.55506535903237
Dislike rough and tumble.	1212.0329353109366
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	300.05812276614995
Saw something in me.	300.67196195318604
Wonder what.	185.8251519251324
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	2418.377694777979
To aid gentleman in literary.	681.8852646417957
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	917.21992304043
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	450.1624296734594
Still, you never know.	183.02739362484968
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	1718.5883128516057
Beauty and the beast.	275.89095307288665
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	396.70896049629505
Wide brim.	1532.5605361623102
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	846.3570261493023
Hair strong in rut.	974.6513744676568
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	687.7922370656266
Why not?	225.76864099602227
Suppose he gave her money.	358.8764710320275
Why not?	225.76864099602227
All a prejudice.	373.7421727690011
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	291.3247167383551
What?	116.16450681686501
I think so.	129.97160947526257
All that for nothing.	184.381973849524
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	645.4298026830924
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	683.7204844709275
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	387.5931212751736
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	470.3007760716993
No, I remember.	123.29417958483484
Richie Goulding: he ’ s another.	267.99242464361646
Weighs on his mind.	412.8913776475957
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	1142.580418636488
Dust.	260.138348246505
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	1638.3807692428454
Could do it myself.	366.86659075188186
Save.	206.4719438318858
Was that just when he, she?	237.79223431019543
O, he did.	81.34381150425716
Into her.	241.94194582913926
She did.	119.42499090156998
Done.	227.25177915691472
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	1021.4834690872675
O Lord, that little limping devil.	573.3197746045319
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	844.8134004216166
Aftereffect not pleasant.	872.9095606293155
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	442.21133383848365
They don ’ t care.	293.8015294218081
Complimented perhaps.	772.3865696785816
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	1187.5695927644601
Well, aren ’ t they?	340.34566046886135
See her as she is spoil all.	382.23117836279243
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	499.9162049409493
The name too.	151.1892538146591
_Amours_ of actresses.	851.4970352393902
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.	2483.7356190182036
Curtain up.	410.9106484460782
Moonlight silver effulgence.	2011.4708044474517
Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	2012.3965662856806
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	647.3858517670841
Still, I feel.	143.7962780171299
The strength it gives a man.	322.4869301491506
That ’ s the secret of it.	115.07576485070287
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	425.1058346516312
Cider that was.	235.37691168817193
Otherwise I couldn ’ t have.	374.2423828577376
Makes you want to sing after.	494.2515709450123
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	5860.809325035524
Suppose I spoke to her.	241.62583393175356
What about?	177.13089119791155
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	773.4666800382179
Ask them a question they ask you another.	556.5416634823397
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	491.27666478737194
Gain time.	503.9948625260005
But then you ’ re in a cart.	259.62245029526804
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	796.179220819051
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	837.3902609190194
All the dirty things I made her say.	347.3519467010164
All wrong of course.	258.639210970833
My arks she called it.	637.7005417159545
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	289.1620774685638
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	1321.9395030001917
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	551.9180350667083
Parrots.	412.94388766377165
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	344.5002389949206
Taking a man from another woman.	410.85476843935055
Or even hear of it.	243.23506251784335
Different with me.	258.9665409228963
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	461.3798056810385
Eating off his cold plate.	849.0836214355871
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	2391.637213460896
French letter still in my pocketbook.	682.815823545057
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	541.3866214589593
Come in, all is prepared.	207.3922270951808
I dreamt.	209.47706560498045
What?	116.16450681686501
Worst is beginning.	589.0464494744454
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	361.894768749351
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	757.4020074185663
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	579.3166431793317
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	339.2677293030667
Because I did.	177.34092944668993
She too.	113.15795356901559
Offend her.	342.15758109850543
Then make it up.	198.74938798678235
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	759.5954698708924
Flatters them.	429.2440628200076
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	468.5862136475581
What harm?	406.444562484961
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	193.4124786928413
First kiss does the trick.	622.11171643203
The propitious moment.	476.1476049600372
Something inside them goes pop.	1192.6934187918303
First thoughts are best.	682.4936880282514
Remember that till their dying day.	556.7677151683306
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	973.0936376222171
But her breasts were developed.	721.4372184812888
Fell asleep then.	845.6446381929712
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	969.4544420876907
Featherbed mountain.	897.5587947883248
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	666.9921780852768
Val Dillon.	715.9172296089077
Apoplectic.	412.94388766377165
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	275.44027027366667
My fireworks.	396.14632700506087
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	409.1430461025543
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	382.73660308847053
Want to be grownups.	553.3496256105365
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	398.4169908396675
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	306.018562323482
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	365.8306126753706
I knew she could whistle.	356.8729715083967
Mouth made for that.	270.0689425311401
Like Molly.	277.4098792812458
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	406.82537167902746
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	284.8584471203124
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	2064.3346892983127
Caressing the little boy too.	439.8496734246969
Onlookers see most of the game.	483.86549627701424
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	830.8176950959596
In their line.	245.02083825357934
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	435.37130001983866
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	463.8113248970355
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	801.2696209216434
Fine eyes she had, clear.	376.93730917582354
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	303.94703226579526
Did she know what I?	315.0683335341936
Course.	191.6715737888812
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	676.058822143605
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	929.5989221507784
Call that innocence?	1035.5707748058605
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	698.4009177564595
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	1975.807734223737
Eyes all over them.	318.78938205287665
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	247.17115789241632
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	543.671547200171
Sharp as needles they are.	892.8973011406201
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	518.0845750379642
Had, too.	135.98225114197461
Where do they get that?	329.7803179778085
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	1151.0653513329537
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	343.56964381129774
Bred in the bone.	393.45184969418693
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	908.1294367875757
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	432.4736619676189
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	788.1943194737764
I never told her.	160.1827141082407
Attract men, small thing like that.	526.0483048044813
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	447.80701192293844
Who did you learn that from?	396.9916470924322
Nobody.	241.4910504830898
Something the nurse taught me.	552.6701796523447
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	606.0780271052572
Me have a nice pace.	506.1778001025316
Mullingar.	185.6778706854622
Who knows?	391.40707013198994
Ways of the world.	232.01122987688524
Young student.	520.7776317692787
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	675.4777978611959
Still she was game.	332.116494022737
Lord, I am wet.	247.80514380266848
Devil you are.	273.7043767323209
Swell of her calf.	449.9452353114574
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	1152.4306052642648
Not like that frump today.	680.1897537340595
A.	48.14463764461572
E.	132.89764665905037
Rumpled stockings.	884.8242381027072
Or the one in Grafton street.	298.914590377671
White.	185.6778706854622
Wow! Beef to the heel.	691.9877257811477
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	1053.7312154388633
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	544.590471356861
Will she?	290.9989421022388
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	995.7683248373589
She smelt an onion.	882.7160178443734
Darling, I saw, your.	188.01337452024742
I saw all.	107.68208671351822
Lord! Did me good all the same.	304.02485693006315
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	393.7014409782114
For this relief much thanks.	913.2335365371681
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	193.62344107177844
Lord! It was all things combined.	595.4950802583916
Excitement.	412.94388766377165
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	703.4349465552679
Your head it simply swirls.	884.1094123433214
He ’ s right.	96.8574367576412
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	727.6009903870545
Instead of talking about nothing.	574.4771169429279
Then I will tell you all.	229.13614773783513
Still it was a kind of language between us.	330.43002414300713
It couldn ’ t be?	310.6181195516321
No, Gerty they called her.	235.11957283718425
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	791.7801885294399
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	1393.7087629835369
Place made me think of that I suppose.	374.48844645260954
All tarred with the same brush.	634.2427608137792
Wiping pens in their stockings.	1228.942760365208
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	401.38328261515903
Every bullet has its billet.	2125.6969898046036
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	1061.9290736934472
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	614.0692524153476
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	1390.5205303774392
No soft job.	422.9175779644672
Saves them.	429.2440628200076
Nature.	227.25177915691472
Washing child, washing corpse.	1138.414205265932
Dignam.	98.80602369420697
Children ’ s hands always round them.	429.7020321708489
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	1690.709932723007
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	1053.2088761524133
Fill it up with wind.	375.7061115596461
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	407.3172339250698
Must call to the hospital.	275.5785311325589
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	889.4986239022711
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	874.0888674574741
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	1018.4680210572291
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	592.6473765888023
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	808.2847529888903
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	1021.5878838522806
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	483.67216875008125
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	431.84624857679046
Chickens come home to roost.	1222.877447985323
They stick by one another like glue.	741.241200568227
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	462.8121467362542
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	685.3134862470721
It ’ s the blood of the south.	146.3915175571537
Moorish.	215.86970372101766
Also the form, the figure.	185.4440944384051
Hands felt for the opulent.	526.8163573485346
Just compare for instance those others.	1035.9485425373425
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	734.5565698894874
Allow me to introduce my.	555.0572523941089
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	463.6485608126688
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	400.13985922844154
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	297.4181754502325
Have their own secrets between them.	728.5140709058235
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	557.042928351778
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	760.5320597667784
As God made them he matched them.	648.9114704859155
Twice nought makes one.	1135.206993329511
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	1272.083292257223
Marry in May and repent in December.	983.6104423632377
This wet is very unpleasant.	897.6622583648885
Stuck.	260.138348246505
Well the foreskin is not back.	389.5328836816348
Better detach.	878.7841292022875
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	1011.4703063499933
Long and the short of it.	145.29635402882454
Very strange about my watch.	709.611514668088
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	1054.2193031736492
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	554.3193396670478
Yes, I suppose, at once.	151.9872253475243
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	443.0558802781345
I remember looking in Pill lane.	670.6255194363795
Also that now is magnetism.	516.4443604399121
Back of everything magnetism.	845.4870933755244
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	1152.6748080896107
That causes movement.	793.5454677670389
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	219.81379889321383
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	1081.7908533320583
Because it ’ s all arranged.	269.5460703272478
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	490.27972084204896
Little piece of steel iron.	915.8286783268856
When you hold out the fork.	383.03676430122755
Come.	92.48991349408898
Come.	92.48991349408898
Woman and man that is.	172.7893492818295
Fork and steel.	577.5648955577719
Molly, he.	74.23953869370044
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	418.01993578022393
Tip.	327.7537808406544
Have to let fly.	409.41054600138443
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	518.7444704506775
Shame all put on before third person.	813.4995571940651
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	506.3514851572787
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	533.363421919024
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	678.593518225995
Fine voice that fellow had.	409.58802414104576
How Giuglini began.	997.5576060290309
Smell that I did.	234.40092348691414
Like flowers.	354.0714088611648
It was too.	125.2889802944183
Violets.	412.94388766377165
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	875.6376082019852
Make their own use of everything.	614.1936075387464
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	816.5201244160831
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	428.81854971504873
Keep that thing up for hours.	390.04058905135895
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	402.9199379278432
Wait.	107.93485186050891
Hm. Hm. Yes.	268.9151220661147
That ’ s her perfume.	180.79769681607962
Why she waved her hand.	432.2750227934795
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	335.31304641079527
What is it?	141.4742941874621
Heliotrope?	884.205033265537
No. Hyacinth?	367.4433136086764
Hm. Roses, I think.	342.9323248361965
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	321.9697802442834
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	891.0090060543599
Why Molly likes opoponax.	1346.0475265349787
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	590.8716440251684
Her high notes and her low notes.	778.1539735873447
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	379.11928914594426
Heat brought it out.	448.5654839374966
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	256.152440343877
Good conductor, is it?	327.3946897143648
Or bad?	460.33846655259305
Light too.	273.045491125935
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	411.63836206452004
Mysterious thing too.	538.682970220886
Why did I smell it only now?	462.46531886259027
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	758.2271473969793
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	1272.1588617169648
Yes, it is.	80.48732413270882
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	1563.0325529156382
Tell you what it is.	190.2812676378682
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	672.713508105928
Clings to everything she takes off.	801.6892468760177
Warm shoe.	891.0778019892612
Stays.	412.94388766377165
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	623.4252641182932
Byby till next time.	810.6524982839046
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	599.8863016323614
Know her smell in a thousand.	367.33554459193715
Bathwater too.	485.55117487321615
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	691.3462182682523
There or the armpits or under the neck.	342.90868387486483
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	429.1195330497222
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	1087.5060096062007
Muskrat.	412.94388766377165
Bag under their tails.	921.6522921227898
One grain pour off odour for years.	1427.5565314533455
Dogs at each other behind.	639.1181189021329
Good evening.	280.03965078490637
Evening.	241.4910504830898
How do you sniff?	717.461890359521
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	450.23982823291595
Yes now, look at it that way.	196.9678984974629
We ’ re the same.	174.19995109888285
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	652.5121110545854
Come near.	225.43291462996618
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	702.41415710942
Like what?	301.2648137774584
Potted herrings gone stale or.	1741.0908000891638
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	1039.0255408384653
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	507.82776376274137
What though?	237.6507908642578
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	753.8103242669191
Breath?	701.7939999806459
What you eat and drink gives that.	374.5820403211578
No. Mansmell, I mean.	247.35700149855063
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different.	723.1686082151657
Women buzz round it like flies round treacle.	1837.3360104453207
Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost.	611.1284926874871
The tree of forbidden priest.	669.793596042324
O, father, will you?	147.38395554942258
Let me be the first to.	155.44224080649357
That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates.	833.5511605235084
Source of life.	346.59199916052086
And it ’ s extremely curious the smell.	387.9244559439561
Celery sauce.	1449.406267364912
Let me.	140.22668517909335
Mr Bloom inserted his nose.	390.82466853967907
Hm. Into the.	246.09643404651266
Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.	421.29567621661806
Almonds or.	400.22851103252833
No. Lemons it is.	242.5144415332011

Happy chairs under them.	880.29737651655
But it ’ s the evening influence.	215.51671601263786
They feel all that.	184.6065188899362
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.	1300.6746832957892

Circus horse walking in a ring.	700.5394140062187
Rip van Winkle we played.	1992.3394562300064
Rip: tear in Henny Doyle ’ s overcoat.	1119.6156989975825
Van: breadvan delivering.	2046.9258288341439
Winkle: cockles and periwinkles.	934.9190810533051
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	1207.427801781357
She leaned on the sideboard watching.	605.0954633050628
Moorish eyes.	318.0683433477999
Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.	2087.8225088653485

Ba. There he goes.	310.0777535940088
Funny little beggar.	848.2062743433572
Wonder where he lives.	402.4378032831271
Belfry up there.	431.96853265668756
Very likely.	539.7458340827997
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	546.7689858143103
Bell scared him out, I suppose.	545.9472040423319
Mass seems to be over.	571.4449198356152
Could hear them all at it.	295.33948192284805
Pray for us.	285.0806177309337
And pray for us.	268.7577261688551
And pray for us.	268.7577261688551

Two houses they have.	389.7854434284844
Gabriel Conroy ’ s brother is curate.	925.8740215641737
Ba. Again.	369.4145606598476
Wonder why they come out at night like mice.	732.7108701027458
They ’ re a mixed breed.	535.5120356250374
Birds are like hopping mice.	1733.1037809990003
What frightens them, light or noise?	760.4717909715866
Better sit still.	556.5492971587618
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	729.8361671146886
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	391.98834227718015
Weeny bones.	1000.7531500377235
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.	680.4189385086147
Colours depend on the light you see.	656.5572950458654
Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	1654.132169336441
Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.	440.20790364227366
Colour of brown turf.	902.2633051716759
Not true.	252.1357774206597
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	1344.1645694271642
Body fifty different colours.	2026.3179458148047
Howth a while ago amethyst.	1063.5221732208818
Glass flashing.	926.0881397841399
That ’ s how that wise man what ’ s his name with the burning glass.	353.459116467654
Then the heather goes on fire.	560.8775786666017
It can ’ t be tourists ’ matches.	562.3512030313756
What?	116.16450681686501
Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.	803.6996732950493
Archimedes.	412.94388766377165
I have it! My memory ’ s not so bad.	289.1901236120126
Ba. Who knows what they ’ re always flying for.	582.299320823877
Insects?	701.7939999806459
Might be the one bit me, come back to see.	257.38137968754467
Birds too.	343.336528365946
Never find out.	315.63225977893023
Or what they say.	268.59498931894416
Like our small talk.	737.3494133020298
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	541.4274358257678
Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.	1637.3215347955686
Dreadful life sailors have too.	956.9892185609503
Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	1819.8243726786047
_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	1083.3093161686477
Married too.	310.2395749439172
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	469.68972388185506
No ends really because it ’ s round.	410.52560412690747
Wife in every port they say.	651.7147836734249
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	1233.1342805531417
If ever he does.	288.59889076978186
Smelling the tail end of ports.	1035.5467848566477
How can they like the sea?	325.25923707306157
Yet they do.	273.91998301973405
The anchor ’ s weighed.	399.11091580419776
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	771.5286759387554
Well.	91.14441446880882
And the tephilim no what ’ s this they call it poor papa ’ s father had on his door to touch.	456.9520610297123
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	333.7092532554742
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	954.252053533284
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	808.4930299690388
Do fish ever get seasick?	1768.2166876543263
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones ’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	1320.8720547732735
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	635.7824939641605
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	1329.74923948753
They floated, fell: they faded.	509.8801533234164
The shepherd ’ s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	570.4497428374613
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	1153.1048084674815
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	1305.1069173986332
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	1186.170958318416
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	854.8333421287421
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	974.8354860322007
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	1074.7321997955632
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	1267.2926546003284
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	1520.7609395489815
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	624.2716125919089

Filthy trip.	1384.824771129642
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	921.5265203844466
Puking overboard to feed the herrings.	1635.1465195296316
Nausea.	412.94388766377165
And the women, fear of God in their faces.	241.06768010180775
Milly, no sign of funk.	460.83813536799187
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	830.9959348553778
Don ’ t know what death is at that age.	375.65388119310995
And then their stomachs clean.	684.4404831586488
But being lost they fear.	503.5925480941306
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	1050.8667631591043
I didn ’ t want to.	173.17695380000737
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	874.2435534812222
Frightening them with masks too.	873.8688373169074
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	381.79483693586195
I ’ ll murder you.	193.2994074560918
Is it only half fun?	742.7021950886351
Or children playing battle.	1281.6839873933523
Whole earnest.	1052.2392794785999
How can people aim guns at each other.	1436.4390932734652
Sometimes they go off.	467.5636666110646
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	2918.4938772871005
After getting better asleep with Molly.	889.7748853493854
Very same teeth she has.	585.0480226699844
What do they love?	333.8871487203706
Another themselves?	763.6497842407058
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	344.83656543067343
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	395.48607760292566
I felt her pulse.	402.79465471615305
Ticking.	412.94388766377165

Little paps to begin with.	761.8338116034888
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	525.0993695611817
Nearer the heart?	553.4821594171057
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	945.6491510774044
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	495.72337429176264
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	591.0640960545509

Will I?	211.20394975606638
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	709.662953462268

Far in the grey a bell chimed.	558.5369256389595
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	724.806111540308
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest ’ s house cooed where Canon O ’ Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	784.6712524623082

Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	653.852355494785

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	3180.1367819257293
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	2454.249861530648
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	1102.8155927803625
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O ’ Shiels, the O ’ Hickeys, the O ’ Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	1352.6403744418076
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	2337.5989136320054
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	2069.5454331215315
O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt! Before born bliss babe had.	1383.8749685700107
Within womb won he worship.	1736.1768923901102
Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was.	962.0007367055122
A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.	2267.8614376418504
Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night ’ s oncoming.	1114.8445546968353
Of Israel ’ s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared.	895.2673978339452
Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.	1440.5007625971664
Of that house A.	237.23062006732457
Horne is lord.	350.4226960967633
Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God ’ s angel to Mary quoth.	2660.8457471506567
Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless.	2522.5062189014525
Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred.	2517.3867431732792
Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.	3372.6736961878014
In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid.	3649.0658733625587
Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland ’ s westward welkin.	3321.2297162058567
Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	1759.6639891131656
Christ ’ s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	1261.43638399807
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne ’ s house.	888.2775918317234
Loth to irk in Horne ’ s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	1250.463645023621
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	1675.7100120756868
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	832.9027701538314
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.	664.2979730659864
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	1443.9926297375575
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	3272.389851294862
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	817.9748587207234
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	1401.4743490618755
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	760.3128181540135
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	1359.2370121953127
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	956.7621366783536
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	993.8862221923816
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	625.7269117659728
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	1248.9620929428286
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	655.799666863514
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	410.88151229293186
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	594.5814840612568
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	715.5902156197789
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	496.93777752421727
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	631.8579919932207
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	5326.452045295082
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	899.3528123142054
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	897.4768756219802
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	1410.588710391033
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	323.56346567131084
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	569.1338844583636
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	883.4298479114018
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	1135.5019744705671
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	1593.5424633742855
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	882.0275954482951
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	1844.0150491291708
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	835.3644512366833
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	1766.0196631855952
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	1390.438040143189
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	1148.0623367920148
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	1116.6669088932872
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	978.8305920011642
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	1419.4696612212097
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	1436.211970732118
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	398.4318663957345
Thanked be Almighty God.	1155.304701091028
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	1598.1462219966909
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	529.4536775888438
Meseems it dureth overlong.	3174.588364895296
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	821.4551175466792
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	767.7548773950956
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	576.4994147333077
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	702.2287222454601
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	1103.9392846965811
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	829.6766149846844
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	610.929652067054
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	926.3579834074709
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	1128.9630951464171
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	760.0611518889259
For they were right witty scholars.	963.0063588739587
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	1088.2257590534912
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	787.8729708083862
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	1113.382192432015
A redress God grant.	1252.8541301892478
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	890.1883516682097
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	1440.8342987551807
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	1516.6048094746973
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	2022.217933675782
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	1289.5857443280922
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	1071.3818086953822
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	400.5402814394886
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	1169.9886247468744
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	1753.4013012596054
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	932.2912476760725
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	1306.4021502652747
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	1483.5809161093703
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	1140.095409427501
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	1397.3973758450304
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	998.5472584277784
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	1012.7216246155662
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	418.27683083811627
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	689.7416411639401
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	1199.452238921644
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	997.8910608448116
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	1308.3198691733212
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	1189.7209160875148
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	1072.887883434477
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	1360.8390535775727
See ye here.	548.134615172028
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	754.3122114952359
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	1142.6867790375445
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions.	860.1952897542394
What means this?	415.1815467732153
Desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	896.454317706557
Mark me now.	307.0006191558602
In woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	763.7398285216178
This is the postcreation.	360.97080043126704
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	6100.2813243294895
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	1765.0911440588459
But here is the matter now.	240.3613800669322
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	1216.198380888447
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l ’ avait mise dans cette fichue position c ’ était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	14159.488690683012
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	538.1789637564144
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	880.7446028892566
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	1000.7819574770106
With will will we withstand, withsay.	948.899037240964
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	2090.5195599665217
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	1450.6142054947256
In Horne ’ s house rest should reign.	807.5401951100797
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	1188.7578074476914
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	1298.9712102962535
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	640.6365898380083
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	1977.7275759136237
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	1728.204735493131
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	5810.606962608537
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	900.0734424027646
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	830.0993917061652
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	469.5628196349769
Go thou and do likewise.	714.2048678041691
Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden.	1494.6698052853603

Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	1048.9014079121366
Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	997.8088832016577
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	905.2822025735396
Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	951.363168102273
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	1499.885553443024
And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.	860.5933982085428
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell ’ s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.	1152.9366675659965

The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt ’ s plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_.	1090.7601970229625
And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.	2080.6085951225186
The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.	1390.1485337644954
First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage.	1088.035035706047
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	1816.7037186521147
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	2450.5291080326565
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn ’ s bivouac.	2640.7782366389133
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	585.746088115488
Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	2302.478819919511
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	775.9479416413923
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	1581.426829577239
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	1386.1701456940334
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	1048.4728307949406
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	1280.5317214616668
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	1056.7013953880498
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	864.5670247855255
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	1042.6917225015638
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	627.692506607066
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	434.0434024622658
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	902.5473090508854
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	612.105599445561
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	685.0045424757099
Heard?	557.0142669171237
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	624.9928861292796
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	477.8415910572893
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	522.7140144293018
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	1213.86964307888
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	1131.370274097776
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	764.4677845901806
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	1439.8105191662728
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	2028.3546227956515
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	1346.890914365163
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	3075.7950929492963
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	1767.809106972007
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	1319.3089873175293
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	1666.0164301066268
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	976.1265808245265
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	1115.7498825877126
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	1472.42432312967
Over against the Rt. Hon.	919.7144028325296

Mulligan a gentleman ’ s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore ’ s the writer ’ s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	629.582100130948
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	784.2810690364041
There Leop.	509.2888581136645
Bloom of Crawford ’ s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy ’ s, Vin.	1076.8802846952822

Leop.	327.7537808406544
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	859.7182848074996
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	737.633694930692
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	1437.5808103909637
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	1324.0017823194428
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	559.8086874142633
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	1086.5561139040055
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	1046.0981103313547
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	483.8028276324168
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	528.1181776191069
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	458.6392303016348
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	857.5595847632667
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	1367.6007518018785
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	1180.2912996495916
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	795.2992193525474
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	394.2026698623878
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	526.5028593342598
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	522.032859944006
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	1907.7816113437318
I question with you there, says he.	144.97166593874184
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	829.0598962221328
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	987.4432224704058
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	490.1174032326381
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	734.5476802919304
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	334.6796359864777
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	756.0509864477986
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	510.5770351911558
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	991.2792712836222
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	785.6300531040843
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	665.4097802056647
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	754.414932595784
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	851.0839231759958
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	654.1408967513096
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	1261.1830543526232
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	528.6962110575611
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	1108.5033433727338
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	748.2234700338879
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	435.90939156063735
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	1105.7435117318082
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	550.0167377512092
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	785.004224606608
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	540.9758044235367
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	1011.0747022948527
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	697.4799349096552
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	933.4377107530701
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	1347.4382997784655
Fertiliser and Incubator.	1017.8659189330191
Lambay Island_.	1822.5318937766035
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	1535.5500426103115
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	307.23477539791475
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	936.5211246816964
Come, be seated, both.	220.85023816758792
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	700.3835758978879
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	1245.1608216749567
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	1825.5705058066874
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	1843.4311231505726
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	1441.778174306774
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	453.98958792454147
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	1301.62727679456
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	2226.5088321603153
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	1049.0866205874117
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	930.0482717773382
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	1718.9736295313903
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	4065.6239417056377
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	1445.9867908473227
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	682.1913364740642
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	617.7917410859391
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	701.7225477904502
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	1117.9978828733965
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	1340.847881859517
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	1152.435086472787
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	1151.0147509329558
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	1081.9114298559455
That you may and very opportunely.	533.9416016555184
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	1152.5362531158821
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	597.9455142328369
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	1059.202895740142
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	1116.4106329106107
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	311.4946747022278
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	1005.7953853635603
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	844.3246415936585
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	1486.4998003044022
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	294.40205170541924
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	1748.1047726441104
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	969.7648098925391
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	702.4316028332815
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	605.7143898749332
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	925.1184441862575
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	1408.626680253672
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	1442.8783703937816
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	1559.3052628176429
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	846.956897012161
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	1320.3962776314409
No woman of any wit would wear one.	604.6006053557711
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	465.2634297345491
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	1273.706046873522
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	1004.8348537277127
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	1608.0546632546927
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	819.4675131078534
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	1155.5929676851
What, you dog?	183.40461107073307
Have you a way with them?	245.6572506140417
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	618.5079852657154
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	1019.8939601224754
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	729.6640524984939
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	505.82318390768575
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	686.103460850007
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	1230.58212821183
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	992.160449008568
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	930.5456433024623
I cannot away with them.	259.3098882169577
What?	116.16450681686501
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	817.7789875724061
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	1288.415590818755
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	909.811640322507
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	749.0263726072857
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	1291.4558282443534
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	956.4269568453866
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	1105.5851111081613
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	2022.5014134797589
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	1005.6093952735955
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	1508.8508645500212
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	1342.2296343650594
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	1504.5044806578196
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	979.9272810582218
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	961.0624845950401
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	870.2284894878047
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	930.2442515191157
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	1011.7116421052206
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	226.32462974239587
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	1057.072566335809
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	994.2325814223404
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	2348.046405726646
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	1087.8921657982278
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	1324.0144978535095
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	1725.7347200244794
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	1383.487549000478
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	1424.5649988792554
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	748.9802091552076
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	837.0259800318892
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	1537.8859245680435
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	1352.031931299451
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	1132.3468899394973
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	1060.6162534297312
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	1471.471136267092
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	2547.4854744479217
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	1647.2696013594598
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	2140.9116427991257
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	1449.0652955360745
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	1456.5649025299267
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	799.4307450564137
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	1429.44694338563
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	1868.9319910303855
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	1461.3676204016786
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	1327.2075431186113
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	1378.6083949018498
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	975.4762662801915
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	1492.3552980359218
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	3059.691495242544
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	1542.7091560132292
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	1243.002838598615
He conjured up the scene before them.	451.748812725857
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	649.9780852568648
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	1150.3043386131249
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	660.8526672948981
Yes, it is true.	149.10370317977973
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	668.7881648897949
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	1047.148529307562
This is the appearance is on me.	237.57661024242023
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	790.0591735569907
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	189.24005075695587
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	696.4397353635923
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	816.9277238547968
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	1299.8719114385576
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	1129.157329350304
He was gone.	131.24231609515
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	728.1241217543123
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	1715.658942883272
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	1198.7064477867605
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	956.4073954477714
The mystery was unveiled.	564.4838904032744
Haines was the third brother.	311.32045308596827
His real name was Childs.	620.516654040285
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	419.0344608623743
He drank drugs to obliterate.	894.820880285297
For this relief much thanks.	913.2335365371681
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	863.9153628527678
No soul will live there.	472.0842218318278
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	1272.6064137910198
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	1059.225936294956
A curse is on it.	203.95166983695188
It is haunted.	453.8168894825265
Murderer ’ s ground.	353.6721883274206
What is the age of the soul of man?	187.17932759708611
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	848.5074813498724
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	1076.8593097225564
A score of years are blown away.	663.555997458504
He is young Leopold.	223.12687895394845
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	579.0131674283041
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	758.0962840329257
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	798.2003520231569
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	1161.4597884206712
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	580.1042352266791
Who can say?	395.0579177857059
The wise father knows his own child.	644.3506801902698
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	624.3826870171326
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	818.5799263099169
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	702.6884979199555
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	797.9125712045116
Did heart leap to heart?	888.58358595573
Nay, fair reader.	754.585999339842
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	1073.0191417798865
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	248.51325717278255
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	1004.8552372652466
No, Leopold.	121.9039338207948
Name and memory solace thee not.	1335.817817691853
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	988.4386069341551
No son of thy loins is by thee.	661.3127969269854
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	410.3698274928243
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	1186.7750626848542
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	2902.2564053232168
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	1231.3697301468956
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	2599.300262618337
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	667.4546237303293
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	831.0156101283735
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	221.11957736129307
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	614.8012437468989
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	2727.074400280684
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	1404.8215357332892
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	1596.7547837874708
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	1587.33848425007
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	1012.8087030626172
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	488.80216118713355
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	258.42638277416506
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	1110.4276558067243
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	1407.7809979231558
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	658.3070925715688
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	978.6918122696144
Where were they now?	335.6784638206786
Neither knew.	519.483764303402
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	319.0904302311446
Why think of them?	257.5440339499768
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	998.5947996844131
Who supposes it?	742.5965311820315
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	934.0059496452836
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	1290.541484576156
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	938.1813140938656
All who wish you well hope this for you.	481.55277085371125
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	922.826878388209
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	842.8205766926753
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	377.9878977929602
Have no fear.	401.43291024093975
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	641.9747635310047
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	395.1700652078512
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	494.92877465638543
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	721.3632448483398
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	882.1848054476769
He told them of the race.	168.73605319431985
Madden up.	175.57678087086015
She was leading the field.	304.15883862287234
All hearts were beating.	782.6580245522459
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	1822.5179193031381
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	1199.977185590536
All was lost now.	246.03554373441605
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	1079.166656735561
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	473.1319926710709
A tear fell: one only.	437.6035009065254
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	699.5274112518152
Lane.	227.25177915691472
Four winners yesterday and three today.	1274.7782562835307
What rider is like him?	483.5827438039446
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	1100.5212568434379
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	535.2672882327785
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	688.1922652958846
She is not the filly that she was.	230.8138241657229
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	556.4537191605824
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	305.10357233788983
Do you remember her, Vincent?	405.43607229882355
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	573.8277323577789
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	696.3005076393923
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	1385.8487519976125
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	1671.614453435777
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	955.9537396467327
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	1404.079341267648
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	429.87348645072456
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	624.6965531660145
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	1363.9274672420377
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	1042.9194180583356
But he had been kind.	256.9656789899525
In going by he had blessed us.	358.9866622900048
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	430.50571732380143
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	1145.554547186875
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	660.0846138408093
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	1565.5461278946652
His soul is far away.	415.15519246729684
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	623.2130591930312
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	1051.2009107883814
Do you not think it, Stephen?	245.2626978511928
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	1604.4833001851794
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	2095.656734513534
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	806.3184175404637
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	2328.067134171391
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	1694.9609885037246
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	1156.1062193558116
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	733.4568184241963
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	878.2100231435492
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	2089.0149211663584
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	712.9504760158594
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	1286.4732471609036
A gallant scene in truth it made.	601.622462918316
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	885.1404051924176
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	1299.5024616768694
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	964.7828072049696
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	2504.862627350047
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	1733.1170033505423
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	717.5461755154373
Dedalus ’ (Div.	311.13608009592275
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	4357.891602496562
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	707.108057995332
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	890.7688148532279
Bloom (Pubb.	315.1107174044705
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	999.0900427167769
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	1598.3094477837092
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	1077.4339790888437
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	2064.8445558685517
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	683.4509684927958
Mr M.	128.45739707214042
Mulligan (Hyg.	484.84022633093747
et Eug.	1083.6839476992607
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	4363.261633134367
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	1143.1397286765437
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	1910.360284371414
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	1947.9763693196555
Mr J.	113.2476767905951
Crotthers (Disc.	927.8388206482978
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	1632.896167420143
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	1667.616982407265
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	1116.8342525131204
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	1272.6553445909929
Lynch (Bacc.	564.4640535066704
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	1271.8334801309445
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	1473.8687069642474
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	1508.6126056915616
Mr S.	126.38482393918412
Dedalus ’ (Div.	311.13608009592275
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	2870.649495623641
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	3027.2714088503712
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	1008.6537907192093
Bloom (Pubb.	315.1107174044705
Canv.) which took place in the commons ’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	483.92897263548474

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	741.8274589131026
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	1169.0851791811924
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	1297.237105317892
She had.	96.23261059383104
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	554.9948956732198
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	662.9464275654376
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	853.4384531733924
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	857.138689209153
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	955.1702690433069
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	751.2048648243045
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	1265.9893646117885
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	2344.201668381079
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	1540.6360042274976
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	836.8260714678484
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	867.6918016636195
He knows and will call in His own good time.	388.57309823782515
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	756.859763713583
Sir, to you my hand.	170.47366306213195
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	994.3730669903322
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	839.5602249990329
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	1015.8799084042045
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	802.7894308672755
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	1002.1961906918395
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	858.9781299251932
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	1426.6002738980897
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	1464.902652428805
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	1688.5548971771977
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	1572.0538628273225
Mark this farther and remember.	611.7276543520409
The end comes suddenly.	492.4081712907418
Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.	1411.0896365925257
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	450.5037053743772
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	1136.4025015930304
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	1912.61901505967

A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	1431.4944027919162
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	1113.4919640110397
But how to get there was the rub.	317.1766153382051
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	2343.1895165882834
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	1301.3355646091156
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	1257.3832076057909
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	598.6990877827609
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	981.6674214575564
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	1286.9134538233964
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	1863.5118882518084
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	1436.7711689782714
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	1190.0999087872708
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	496.689043272793
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	1201.1566603641438
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	1031.1434379844122
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	796.770259699861
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	821.8232314909022
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	2143.277232062583
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	824.1155802258538
s.	30.249532919792383
d.	84.19061972527764
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	1252.38682199234
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	1092.3643464300778
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	361.0737957784466
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	1748.3644786143373
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	936.6766544118487
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	881.7580163704616
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	713.6432041138638
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	294.0103067817653
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	1217.2098841560537
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	2054.6859078527605
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	1785.493534703935
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	1025.0121585366744
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	874.6020942433646
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	2049.3930779414372
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	911.6252587786461
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	1703.2624342450126
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	1070.3606740194664
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	527.7032030711453
His friends had all deserted him.	578.0480918179082
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	812.3906879555366
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	295.2666325048771
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	653.3353484822001
Anyhow he was all in.	162.320823645901
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	447.31888480744936
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	527.2140819654131
Try it.	175.45035456230517
You may mention my name.	567.0105156251177
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	398.94893459698284
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	372.1452217952562
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	578.3968056576392
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	387.0743899334545
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	738.0103385320366
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	1120.1991486771133
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	393.78914524953683
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	874.8926182558483
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	1785.184685021189
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	465.6326753196059
Whereas.	260.138348246505
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	752.701181602887
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	814.1672401812277
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	784.3319308768498
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	1499.4025674961479
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	2100.971686751093
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	689.870475602247
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	717.2166230492967
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	733.6226896504318
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	279.20488693469656
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	337.36133875492607
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	310.00793382411797
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	268.3266203853743
Who ’ s that with you?	140.96191754444473
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	625.0963605780545
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	380.2580790652607
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	507.25606300958566
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	416.195677520419
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	667.4812034912364
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	912.5016056976156
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	1090.877270217429
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	1000.1068093053511
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	2581.032283748346
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	695.4867031274626
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	964.6769972639364
Pretty thick that was certainly.	662.6182192827764
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	772.8953674389445
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	322.58933932433354
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	547.7120621605229
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	1339.5646571993072
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	394.36861444652567
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	453.1002749959935
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	414.8024328193024
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	616.813388460753
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	1083.2327969102719
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	1213.554134687421
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	415.2643099740676
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	340.2287206519172
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	1103.2218399974893
Simply fag out there for nothing.	920.3681751002932
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	711.8405022715499
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	456.61506510718095
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	800.4952220793342
Where does he live at present?	643.7344250965917
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	319.1696491392211
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	443.0621786554739
Why?	184.539251337404
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	602.7727370626286
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	456.919378460872
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	933.9994829543349
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	1085.9560292167714
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	946.5580304524956
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	907.2328582701057
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	477.5533195000112
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	1023.991141485086
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	1244.9822414674427
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	755.4137797366354
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	1326.9367911572065
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	1688.5593423367936
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	2131.849647844053
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	7644.172987358389
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	1014.8389903407468
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	1140.6209239530235
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	3223.4013337470114
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	863.4140192311623
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	2051.1026547975343
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	2485.5988329788734
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	870.8297784044864
I mean for singing purposes.	511.28819457588077
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	602.530378224335
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	1410.3309197681813
_Belladonna.	412.94388766377165
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	856.2919552602604
They were haggling over money.	764.6774006170076
— Is that so?	215.83342174263097
Mr Bloom asked.	153.57621075409475
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	1310.3862340506212
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	1275.01676335186
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	606.5047296933488
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	1360.2511210312198
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	592.4218894070443
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	1000.8552483225001
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	283.0987815158759
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	1408.4294128175668
What ’ s in a name?	131.06804436970032
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	437.91882177571244
Of course.	231.0123685864232
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	848.4356522169198
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	1133.3527198484305
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	928.5787519178355
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	1572.1203172501725
— You know Simon Dedalus?	451.5170107208108
he asked at length.	267.1765853099575
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	162.23614291713596
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	504.5908254805499
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	522.9030499823526
All Irish.	188.8732105515256
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	375.18225153453386
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	880.752091553787
The lefthand dead shot.	974.1853623509933
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	1329.1687898140046
— Bottles out there, say.	291.17073328819265
Fifty yards measured.	2968.474628534548
Eggs on the bottles.	411.0758164526427
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	850.9404070780106
Aims.	412.94388766377165
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	619.973812204259
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	1270.5862373845678
— Pom! he then shouted once.	506.5746815074564
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	1954.722410172583
— Pom! he shouted twice.	550.1327172367692
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	1997.5430395286792
— Long ago?	499.4640448074627
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	1477.898465834
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	763.9073040768801
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	1144.924470377355
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	314.481909390965
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	866.317232468386
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	327.29441053534043
D.	128.74184503718442
B.	119.75576330508032
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	595.0492197788851
Know where that is?	371.2848993333594
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	632.7017354072277
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	2222.9498896762757
That ’ s where I hails from.	297.89924725333776
I belongs there.	232.35131139411
That ’ s where I hails from.	297.89924725333776
My little woman ’ s down there.	256.20743157181454
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	159.05786642848776
_For England, home and beauty_.	869.1405723535719
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	625.2418868903721
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	1349.5778558997135
Across the world for a wife.	258.77717945064916
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	1981.977434488675
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	999.6816697577416
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	1163.3831513808705
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	724.2393078345364
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	711.5951675219503
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	493.829296167966
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	922.0186953640593
No chair for father.	336.1737233372553
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	1846.8339070805318
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	1103.3948619015653
Grin and bear it.	460.31672075089966
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	1214.5749802978542
B.	119.75576330508032
Murphy.	180.3698566476659
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	602.6060856074076
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	795.27132761277
— Thank you, the sailor said.	168.0254206167637
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	798.0159403453181
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	1914.4796780155455
I shipped to get over.	343.57025158835114
Paid off this afternoon.	1047.4008451808656
There ’ s my discharge.	250.17428264744686
See?	240.01017189778602
D.	128.74184503718442
B.	119.75576330508032
Murphy.	180.3698566476659
A.	48.14463764461572
B.	119.75576330508032
S.	82.15294473651714
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	1540.9112226467446
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	482.0137284523714
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	666.2944275822229
I was in the Red Sea.	202.86412552140024
I was in China and North America and South America.	702.5011078188192
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	1430.1381434488214
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	1176.5406538085547
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	851.9826266318927
I seen Russia.	507.067957705724
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	2167.3678953985213
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	480.4408751894662
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	497.819861755611
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	693.3504223654747
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	875.3242419315758
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	994.5842364699231
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	662.5849473465975
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	1147.6966547240918
Look here.	227.96969693026293
Here they are.	198.59843386687345
A friend of mine sent me.	384.9173200584437
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	814.2395052089482
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	1559.5225268151366
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	1679.0462197988406
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	1588.7411620945607
Stomachs like breadgraters.	1603.6444042272217
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	1195.934751925723
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	1761.1297680167145
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	1334.7567631496245
— Know how to keep them off?	524.8295755755804
he inquired generally.	604.8613688161315
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	1154.7541084789743
That boggles ’ em.	774.9865907493603
Glass.	241.4910504830898
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	1569.0860186150187
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	1891.8239157526573
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	1898.7808696936959
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	1835.133323536929
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	870.2872614225804
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	1377.7546556828327
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	1943.4998818397075
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	851.8800469099327
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	1990.4962190212311
That was the rub.	203.44705461784687
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	1367.207780986749
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	1263.1840251644517
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	1518.3985730732265
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	1016.7405789490681
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	776.67754370227
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	259.4044657248911
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	728.9680130931065
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	271.3941759177154
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	1268.472755847623
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	1529.820151385364
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	635.615055190963
Knife in his back.	221.70874746186982
Knife like that.	256.7812756972678
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	1329.6388079674903
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	945.4820978145973
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	559.6691557132598
Like that.	114.52974468043327
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	655.66377315259
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	487.86617568030124
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	2317.281730494123
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	566.5505434546232
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	1518.581715815129
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	424.85921811628754
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	1095.7960787385118
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	1311.0715459721207
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	859.2296250331736
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	1454.6449564812951
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	781.479945993484
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	1072.4152877222407
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	282.03236717737013
Give us back them papers.	537.9419910655864
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	1084.4572925229588
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	431.59111735382646
Mr Bloom inquired.	347.9127167053399
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	465.983000497631
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	729.58094150688
— What year would that be about?	315.3001812046062
Mr B interrogated.	607.2215102729564
Can you recall the boats?	821.1608832784183
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	1076.3900017391927
Salt junk all the time.	644.7738876571228
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	736.497005244625
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	1055.9779192915448
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	1287.0881002432109
And it left him wondering why.	478.5680923323617
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	545.1856367587073
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	684.3491173719842
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	1102.6103954049088
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	722.0982435947881
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	613.9303524999366
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	501.0045096505694
I hate roaming about.	547.9471806640095
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	586.5318763131231
— What age is he?	238.04435539207424
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	1004.2285289590059
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	685.4728577735303
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	363.55748115637726
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	1968.607526223217
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	662.8441107734266
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	575.6597604759016
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	426.64255139226117
I hate those buggers.	604.4246385751222
Suck your blood dry, they does.	802.248900361117
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	882.2726535036539
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	690.125966520888
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	2009.2421445747764
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	249.72968897583974
There he is himself, a Greek.	188.4608706022313
one asked the sailor.	188.84725903538617
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	653.6661113029473
Someway in his.	220.3934751436291
Squeezing or.	400.22851103252833
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	303.22825824296467
There he is cursing the mate.	491.9656125037861
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	460.03340855626936
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	1476.943526110938
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	526.6805418134784
He ’ s gone too.	150.97469165133268
Ate by sharks after.	1048.5355698087235
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	577.1087645918739
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	574.2886352502298
— And what ’ s the number for?	176.11591859415404
loafer number two queried.	1343.0269726457689
a third asked the sailor.	250.12911221970535
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	750.8067497143752
Ate.	327.7537808406544
A Greek he was.	174.77891323397188
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	1334.2737108817723
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	618.6321126792492
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	681.5432987331584
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	1463.0612151223154
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	952.3237425201809
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	813.1843611266171
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	1115.5400287566076
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	271.86848270275243
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	1087.7417803813094
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	1566.9037386231125
Still no matter what the cause is from...	224.57229268162695
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	1039.229958186563
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	643.1604253158221
She is a bad merchant.	342.7190137752267
She buys dear and sells cheap.	1405.0949061479607
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	886.1236311634144
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	1381.648783746918
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	301.77438033632325
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	532.2952240206859
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	689.082218934281
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	1379.4342101776294
Do you?	200.83024688599602
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	1019.5923015491459
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	1361.9262598386788
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	1497.118073269766
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	393.41723390220915
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	600.9154529481564
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	736.1202085831071
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	1387.5551706950946
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	1269.9571709221414
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	593.1316886084054
I ’ m not so sure about that.	223.87995290768225
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	655.7947895683334
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	802.6501403511069
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	316.69402531073246
Let me stir it.	391.2530841920621
And take a piece of that bun.	354.91488982042773
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	544.1652304468889
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	615.7379322587134
Try a bit.	243.37085455646883
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	738.4725362664166
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	1480.2279788469116
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	1274.2978992033277
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	493.742017926816
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	1407.6518082477087
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	2015.4320975453986
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	501.5940165406977
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	1289.1356204508459
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	1119.5708987914497
You ought to eat more solid food.	897.0455662825859
You would feel a different man.	353.18210741251073
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	372.10558184101416
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	569.64659934896
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	169.04791980593555
It reminds me of Roman history.	657.2055030357999
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	1294.7102429143042
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	1565.9198314774615
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	1072.0208251693525
Look at him.	160.51215575913645
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	1159.2744522552846
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	748.7473175268173
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	1797.0576708524834
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	1216.8848991376274
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	2466.9361957380875
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	1045.801465530905
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	335.13370024326366
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	876.1396092516165
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	630.2208697084775
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	1100.8583957079713
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	474.96283305490664
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	1581.2905951140726
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	1536.2360351773962
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	1197.941677764207
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	735.9796983172732
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	253.5297786638666
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	1322.3762020627416
She has the Spanish type.	420.998211735069
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	771.2297070303733
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	1088.6066024989755
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	467.2784620759615
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	644.4913651779057
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	11375.597833836957
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	429.32220031786125
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	1412.5938498877813
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	254.16909938934376
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	264.5180118501574
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	819.5516920506393
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	767.8164737844446
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	668.0037971574911
An exception here and there.	449.10096965194845
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	508.7004042509244
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	635.4656076785905
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	496.87969999125454
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	777.6555021723041
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	421.02712972840334
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	640.8616685875517
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	1376.6340841859324
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	1401.387961682037
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	226.3780074596798
s.	30.249532919792383
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	1708.3019910387604
No aid was given.	452.159787971947
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	608.3370725869554
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	252.19099295379246
At this stage an incident happened.	1420.8075313649924
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	1356.3359713109294
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	1095.393573987601
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	706.3824707966469
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	991.4275190684438
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	1369.5034061471833
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	1620.9069453696084
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	2867.5958902410403
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	1589.975238388384
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	1223.3694141945205
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	782.3524579584686
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	941.8915121745229
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	1274.8521075182423
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	1128.9715791922595
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	1368.9288019681828
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	930.5616239025532
— Am I right, skipper?	490.8863483721886
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	550.7230061213965
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	1417.1894492671893
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	709.1695066600131
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	1412.2927717062712
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	1357.7097693954017
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	961.1078238735307
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	1332.1164709252507
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	1141.0844174830704
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	423.36673103577823
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	287.4778074121897
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	1311.1967396197322
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	614.3240264548756
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	461.0308254712767
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	1027.8443930422068
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	3949.408768588164
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	1471.2296246564533
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	1863.9338979981526
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	361.4198955920337
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	2854.945919543616
And the best jumpers and racers?	928.7681343118627
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	974.8252018761069
Tell me that.	156.78783292914207
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	1068.7243148749667
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	377.41757092329124
The Irish catholic peasant.	826.8480365316186
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	283.9141621695168
You know Jem Mullins?	2200.835382112782
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	1349.0004865052574
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	1024.9789214964876
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	1426.6020761866453
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	927.9297343553162
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	822.1887841788631
And now, why?	213.76558877616097
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	616.0948884592895
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	929.4676072865701
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	1566.339617515785
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	1072.9064643760623
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	923.6216604238019
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	781.2850200815539
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	2035.3620061680108
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	696.9408440828348
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	1642.0179456156104
s.	30.249532919792383
d.	84.19061972527764
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	665.002032736336
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	969.1470404227305
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	928.784539482766
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	593.4061637198772
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	552.0010462880939
A soft answer turns away wrath.	1384.917705421465
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	425.8921560599577
Am I not right?	411.07735663655615
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	782.4779365593051
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	1297.2302956030683
— Of course, Mr B.	269.3459154672875
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	564.9629727859204
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	1001.5116607460993
But with a little goodwill all round.	414.4899178134075
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	1137.4923372056726
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	1340.373802899456
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	1173.7568929024114
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	1220.6438223118093
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	565.2759309231653
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	1605.499542628786
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	281.105246163389
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	215.2918525284395
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	925.2912152285343
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	961.6635794127897
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	802.0950336532317
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	760.3566993752166
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	1605.4114911522315
Why?	184.539251337404
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	797.6158171558692
They are practical and are proved to be so.	469.9122980803331
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	563.8313756071167
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	995.2319183226655
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	652.6191793355435
Turks.	286.319300185858
It ’ s in the dogma.	166.8032759708927
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	690.7119952697316
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	410.0856373160142
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	1236.5109721678175
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	815.5846780911069
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	323.28066407918914
I call that patriotism.	343.4597911499556
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	2409.840949028697
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	326.83875843002556
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	967.2476738718142
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	1015.4447374009104
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	301.3288688198508
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	589.3182352627919
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	1074.2816755703116
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	425.9381409411792
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	431.78826274239844
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	775.277483276915
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	1674.1058060331013
That ’ s work too.	191.95631902525153
Important work.	792.2926540101219
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	684.9643482720554
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	838.16327131593
What?	116.16450681686501
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	432.09060363217606
Each is equally important.	1293.8562767429755
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	936.3119312158398
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	482.2638837548871
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	616.5169194767385
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	996.0200854928039
Excuse me.	223.90253313435664
What was it you...?	65.86770690541113
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	952.7068150884128
Let us change the subject.	445.19120149392046
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	842.3321899625697
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	704.2303587695022
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	1497.4670617117947
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	998.534632180573
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	1277.8339385248044
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	1093.071257798459
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	1457.3243500978756
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	984.5534110298122
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	1257.8454090308928
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	684.7265978474658
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	690.1979143793835
With brains, sir.	267.20540077418025
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	854.2881072794975
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	2730.3751809556456
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	470.55029525133875
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	776.8685527571919
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	1107.2121076983442
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	1364.709114728894

Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn ’ t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope.	1190.249180649768
Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.	1393.707716575471
— There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	299.3523794331025
— Who?	160.92060442380037
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	199.69686153982937
One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read: _Return of Parnell_.	658.9576228153516

Dead he wasn ’ t.	309.6844830281192
Simply absconded somewhere.	2169.1275677752424
The coffin they brought over was full of stones.	474.8247671923675
He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	773.4668741851837
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	416.50113443820254
And so forth and so on.	201.87054979986482
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	1118.871620907522
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	809.4390402071884
Something evidently riled them in his death.	815.6141671263126
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	1935.953029127212
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	2121.584971689103
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	1179.5043155313167
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	1138.1843666546242
And the identical same with murderers.	527.8060955891019
You had to come back.	194.61341124626364
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	733.170252740321
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	805.1870689159636
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	955.4239446823807
Still as regards return.	706.9142463595341
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	739.5128926167389
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	840.317237597491
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	859.2924007130667
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	562.8809692954468
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	661.262755665794
She put the first nail in his coffin.	363.2399853941164
— Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi - disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	821.4325246798911
She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	545.2332279421515
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	280.8894889744021
The husband was a captain or an officer.	504.57181471262084
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	592.1320278589385
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	2559.5200566589315
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	1054.6041684893885
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	1542.853374338321
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	1077.8738808171333
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	669.2489906569543
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	1174.2801799427386
Poser.	412.94388766377165
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	1188.1966804206254
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	1366.731488695331
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	684.2131774139649
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	636.812567694581
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	620.2962424285528
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	940.8911878103659
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	371.79237299912154
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	466.56173892223694
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	947.9151576763602
— Was she?	251.90959283804372
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	1027.7746924678784
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	384.5164458503932
So, Spain.	195.48085631507226
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	1023.3654967783508
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	531.1949905745004
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	1022.2327596506634
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	689.6757640287724
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	1106.03686369504
Taken a few years since.	766.1476793467345
In or about ninety six.	648.388634824299
Very like her then.	240.52992569955723
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	1381.2707000293767
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	620.8962385144573
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	609.1461688801859
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	884.343456811513
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	352.15037761016714
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	2140.7906839780053
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	780.0660076487743
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	748.4378716240188
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	886.9829184471266
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	1105.1047888261298
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	761.7573349397294
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	2069.2557688554148
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	945.7139468792592
Suppose she was gone when he?	405.11584330217556
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	1479.193856530902
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	609.1260118828972
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	496.680457211643
And why not?	295.77161058991624
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	1755.3734591407867
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	936.8653214435305
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	1275.913813138066
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	1443.7460615852408
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	1284.2168857290876
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	765.255293252937
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	1165.1166357357247
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	1187.858742201761
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	1138.2081629978038
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	1519.4350955106004
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	1102.2458886475126
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	1698.8487047752255
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	920.6621666455405
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	991.1220940313709
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	303.6981170129884
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	1215.756720268135
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	1774.3387622614252
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	688.3327674762475
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	2134.0088821850472
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	1329.7437829381124
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	509.6038461083022
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	611.8522218624577
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	642.5613464332943
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	1173.6896844348623
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	887.6830642492263
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	1227.8772577931247
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	1816.9133154673063
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	1234.4157210657347
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	1165.740575394517
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	1188.5664515271758
Your god was a jew.	432.6814041232579
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	1741.2072448067609
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	1389.7308588658461
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	949.1760815742623
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	370.4912909075285
Do you like cocoa?	571.9362383535254
Wait.	107.93485186050891
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	403.0452944853464
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	1008.8607407263439
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	448.529164885872
An opening was all was wanted.	412.8917056654164
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	564.1538736666934
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	981.892034427636
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	1245.3022242493296
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	1850.0267413697495
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	865.123654588773
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	958.7447370413375
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	1051.4590836631007
— Are you bad in the eyes?	239.88658396259618
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	1060.5007942027319
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	1010.5146730474078
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	681.3942910794938
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	350.6187048844852
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	2163.1484285226647
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	1082.2091801984009
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	467.89048888938754
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	1694.3326138013808
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	443.72649086828574
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	326.2272492539192
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	999.033830954899
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	888.0934217929426
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	693.9503339256805
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	736.0883613082411
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	253.44207803596
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	387.77386772638295
Come.	92.48991349408898
It ’ s not far.	165.68254825461895
Lean on me.	267.18559027969025
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	512.5387611127528
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	566.1686197288975
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	1044.004581118207
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	923.105291300342
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	1126.7710097437623
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	811.1753613256084
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	1035.2185999804346
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	1620.7376650050603
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	1128.2371934702062
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	719.4718221289229
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	1326.7221046754446
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	664.407319924957
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	1496.433808034237
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	1459.64985548844
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	1664.4824182320551
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	785.7533039159848
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	1049.4478821859739
Beware of the steamroller.	391.7294876781869
They thereupon stopped.	998.7015971166039
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	917.0290508862057
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	622.8315467506542
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	453.02163842241544
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	860.3613447180936
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	1305.881239372673
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	1263.2443157693383
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	1130.7483876457238
— What ’ s this I was saying?	210.11930326562842
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	1092.454431517081
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	919.0525159185863
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	898.0202596934857
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	3016.216658666264
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	2976.253476648527
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	2679.930521807924
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	439.0486742701781
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	1767.6934454431937
A.	48.14463764461572
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	1239.2420740304278
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	929.3321967776554
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	1172.7588035197998
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	1432.1272267876354
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	2541.8848233387816
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	844.9334752993628
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	1379.5332519329054
The horse was just then.	260.3482838767736
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	1363.347879436073
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	1197.0112451628524
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	812.1955240586651
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	973.7659222718202
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	683.6995262669018
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	10134.505528245361
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	805.2539683314473
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	1080.0242191040368
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	1288.5416479669905
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	1485.027405407171
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	1653.800294730221
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	2390.3597105879467
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	988.9897325519233
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	3210.3491438517744
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	2393.6119864491316
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	1148.4632046128545
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	5168.211194609565
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	4150.907569457636
Were their views on some points divergent?	1731.0445008409683
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	1235.3421418614976
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	1449.9816144180438
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	2073.410801982494
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	1032.0843036325093
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	1450.6270771360055
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	2825.0575910790635
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	1651.7612350445586
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	1400.937226508833
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	2690.517327652213
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	1253.3452580435633
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	514.9396365017462
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	650.007289118912
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	1777.796105614672
As in what ways?	434.4065505666851
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	759.313917493962
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	931.6064047443981
Was it there?	270.90246156578706
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	455.57470698440784
Why was he doubly irritated?	1197.0209111724023
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	613.1066469023057
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	974.692051017751
To enter or not to enter.	559.4588242687375
To knock or not to knock.	420.1815396567561
Bloom ’ s decision?	315.3675611245627
A stratagem.	432.4394399146262
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	1272.4613473485315
Did he fall?	399.6079243061477
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	1676.7448990148798
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	2068.440464446139
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	3087.0285859087126
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	1122.0650669170477
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	1184.82703604209
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	1810.6334915532311
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	1355.5572420604094
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	388.15594549831104
Did Stephen obey his sign?	949.585266435161
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	790.0584658858572
What did Bloom do?	295.2093253807692
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	1833.9193689071344
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	1512.0193997473682
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	838.7704610200644
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	569.697357185474
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	3764.053032454084
What did Bloom see on the range?	363.2825499585172
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	1312.7423743047211
What did Bloom do at the range?	386.4763058206949
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	811.9399013252057
Yes.	72.08392493010007
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	2338.7684392953743
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	1324.4272997248652
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	577.9378548206499
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	3035.6568061570147
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	1424.704862969223
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	1850.3391677800369
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	882.9679136945996
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	1475.370097159712
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	1504.9196407613986
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	1371.6359113733886
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	4518.27056996165
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	1050.8761023009517
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	770.0983909338819
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	1053.975240934318
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	974.8771616399914
The phenomenon of ebullition.	501.06095502953366
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	3667.49949577046
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	1654.0974140629442
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	1056.6923732709508
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	2290.7481217591885
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	1312.801797324901
To shave himself.	503.0873384551733
What advantages attended shaving by night?	1895.4310845284442
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	2225.5441083718574
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	1381.269604212226
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	1101.3510207206632
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	999.8748300899772
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	1597.0137263905806
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	833.4057662259718
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	2930.855117723281
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	1567.175921415921
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	747.7718712202714
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	2133.4099764187013
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	2794.7879989391013
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	1139.8706338693696
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	905.205835655292
In Bernard Kiernan ’ s licensed premises <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street: in David Byrne ’ s licensed premises, <NUM> Duke street: in O ’ Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon ’ s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	1022.4598122083645
W.	131.45299260355975
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	1081.362145561803
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	1016.3340851790367
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	4157.911822132266
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	3287.4466201688706
His mood?	645.8575690639493
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	440.52350154341246
What satisfied him?	420.64816450925474
To have sustained no positive loss.	1427.7615363678638
Light to the gentiles.	326.62735753253634
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	1116.101109053268
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	1298.2428836056565
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	1723.2557467475767
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	1074.8840080423918
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	1092.5398266940765
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	1187.599124989748
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	1609.8493377892012
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	536.0390901649329
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	486.5201715363153
Who drank more quickly?	877.0838369576546
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	706.8728864319472
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	2869.2991686367354
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	1674.4235507919866
Had he found their solution?	846.2652727851122
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	1338.492342836652
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	822.4481519598296
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you ’ ll find room.	1438.806837410227
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	887.702781380911
Bloom.	47.33347058841286
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	1619.4273733862321
Name, age, race, creed.	479.76798861413613

Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	3973.813594441492
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	1252.0945465987554
Dearer far than song or wine.	1339.1345411420427
You are mine.	257.9576550335248
The world is mine.	252.81479085819623
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	1302.4169063172303
G.	185.6778706854622
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	1027.240908633402

Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?	3248.961337567267
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born <NUM>, acceded <NUM>) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist ’ s non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist ’ s revelations of white articles of non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody ’ s Book of Jokes_ (<NUM> pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	2168.1948084241526
What relation existed between their ages?	2010.2021059467777
<NUM> years before in <NUM> when Bloom was of Stephen ’ s present age Stephen was <NUM>.	319.1222223167347
<NUM> years after in <NUM> when Stephen would be of Bloom ’ s present age Bloom would be <NUM>.	367.59797319031327
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	944.9194301901431
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	5853.915908315837
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	493.5199122544978
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin ’ s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s father and Stephen ’ s granduncle, Stephen being then <NUM> years older.	482.65828718971665
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	1009.4175071704765
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	2242.326534478995
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	1941.6101155568801
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	936.8174663151199
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	1379.5753416584098
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	2568.2951381534863
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	978.0851728316165
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	1338.520552509872
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	1605.1452680975601
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	1879.9422193269804
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	1981.348780656212
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	2254.16598316041
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	1856.330346420065
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	2482.412988991374
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	3976.2924624464526
Neither.	286.319300185858
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen?	568.8053415444097
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	309.760235136087
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?	1121.2388741518582
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	1677.429998060917
Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	1224.0721306663168
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?	789.9976686144914
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	683.2774620956669
A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O ’ Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	804.758482485735
C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	247.94841506923302
Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C.	689.7703677898406
C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	261.3795535682915
Did they find their educational careers similar?	2269.1235443280325
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame ’ s school and the high school.	944.796390387896
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	1464.2401112178936
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	1028.2595204653683

What two temperaments did they individually represent?	2343.8188525926134
The scientific.	285.4416756800943
The artistic.	240.0268818434048
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	1483.300402516796
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	1753.0395580991712
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	4638.270183015059
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	1870.699250097556
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	7132.328631494265
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	904.2643181469365
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	2420.7065489499496

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?	2477.3951621206907
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.	1446.9643129047704
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?	1007.1965037385147
Solitary hotel in mountain pass.	1116.4800224998896

What?	116.16450681686501
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel.	732.4978259224965
Queen ’ s Ho...	145.06212424946676
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	1084.3453618861965
The Queen ’ s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the <NUM> June <NUM>, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of <NUM> parts of aconite liniment to <NUM> of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at <URL> <URL>. on the morning of <NUM> June <NUM> at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, <NUM> Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at <URL> <URL>. on the afternoon of <NUM> June <NUM> a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, <NUM> Main street, Ennis.	930.1634930099012
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	2738.9565241726546
Coincidence.	241.4910504830898
He preferred himself to see another ’ s face and listen to another ’ s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	1211.0380850189633
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	1377.7183959882839
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	2790.1753071027138
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise <URL> <URL>., sunset <URL> <URL>. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	1068.9795372725857
What to do with our wives.	298.3961169175746
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	2199.0698780970874
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	3908.086479735494
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	1462.6170667116035
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	1611.2394845974968
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	1103.3257689308168
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	1052.000896041939
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	2226.9660227360255
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	3063.7219325018
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	2830.430483272064
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	1300.246866985786
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	1830.910616688622
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	1604.6085358684945
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	1596.0460245162008
Variously.	412.94388766377165
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other ’ s ignorant lapse.	1416.4627332852901
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	1989.9975305900746
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	1075.13371684145
What system had proved more effective?	1762.468310280488
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	7518.144849474435
Example?	884.205033265537
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	828.8295847534148
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest ’ s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	2475.048103460752
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	1361.5272218721893
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	849.2461640511876
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	1119.4538890400465
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?	1925.9971320008908
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	3091.4537135255964
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?	1453.181741275108
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	1593.447363998593
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m ’ baad l ’ zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	2295.798986899887
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	1783.6359524174554
By juxtaposition.	720.2432103098506
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, and <NUM>.	1216.8183997657247
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	1035.7731478467942
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	3872.603537104656
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	1554.337647441467
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar <NUM> years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	2164.344253867937
Mary ’ s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve ’ s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	1775.3642993902154
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	6213.445435276542
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	936.4694948850461
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	1686.268109993262
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	963.0596596988813
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	2675.342134395676
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	3330.9469082410315
Did the guest comply with his host ’ s request?	787.2992679757099
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	1137.0163083947457
What was Stephen ’ s auditive sensation?	641.206145694284
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	1047.291976229192
What was Bloom ’ s visual sensation?	545.2373999327854
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	711.326009572674
What were Stephen ’ s and Bloom ’ s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	1179.0487460791007
Visually, Stephen ’ s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	2649.0968387341345
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	694.4397387625238
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.	805.8266532314179

C., Rufus Isaacs, K.	561.1258443808366
C.	96.23846299732125
On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († <NUM>), exponent of Shakespeare.	1664.5532159150425
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	1838.8074834893248
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	2451.5183842236593
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	1075.0889544206766
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	1172.688321290769
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	978.448588919583
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew ’ s windows all.	821.6971131196533
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	811.3816376635124
With unmixed feeling.	1130.0089401158739
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	590.7273703360041
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	591.081412712668
Then out there came the jew ’ s daughter And she all dressed in green.	429.42861012106323
“ Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again. ” I can ’ t come back and I won ’ t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	734.9881139921556
For if my master he did hear He ’ d make it a sorry ball. ” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	935.0539387467734
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	534.5061433324041
And now he ’ ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	544.2581022625518
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	911.9205537356688
With mixed feelings.	798.7600695154841
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew ’ s daughter, all dressed in green.	416.7739426358479
Condense Stephen ’ s commentary.	751.2971169670935
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	230.95415600791705
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	1773.92215004264
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	747.0978648240277
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	789.8976656399343
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	947.1241238996408
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	483.04370001768206
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	615.0161393149002
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	529.9695826662371
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	817.1905248793701
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	1422.03762246702
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	1523.436804020992
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	1294.0454305265769
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	1007.7197717135637
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	2019.1515102902463
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	1011.2428612398214
What other infantile memories had he of her?	574.6304434591723
<NUM> June <NUM>.	245.24006735803727
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	3848.878531408307
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	1666.3950713196054
What endemic characteristics were present?	2553.926846626934
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	2100.461467981387
What memories had he of her adolescence?	606.1618621830745
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	1256.4684674337038
On the duke ’ s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	1144.8910640567058
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	1307.201990424329
On the vigil of the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).	1050.198374117528
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	1076.6930452634797
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	913.2105923740103
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	1684.9443204804238
A temporary departure of his cat.	549.5326724332689
Why similarly, why differently?	1187.204215497589
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	696.3469045849496
In other respects were their differences similar?	1656.1618353921376
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	479.9499281498199
As?	212.54072154847802
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	1368.4044346308633
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	1947.096398588472
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	1250.4470968372532
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	601.9263150766046
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	824.0061857200999
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	1654.3818248546386
In what manners did she reciprocate?	1277.2925420166885
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	1560.8809701590912
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	1333.3448600469853
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	1058.988731666227
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	672.8735990624125
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	1547.700863861842
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	1628.8841875984017
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	833.2770597504923
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	1808.2221867348178
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	2428.720654293871
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	451.1116879424731
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	2111.010170223038
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, <NUM> October <NUM>.	2153.636018430547
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?	3191.889285230411
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), <NUM> June <NUM>, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	724.3819961409755
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	1186.316743017053
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	1044.3820600856945
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	1018.2879633351123
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ <NUM> <NUM>), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	671.882187083282
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	1926.7160150023617
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	908.8556710217094
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	726.1143016473786
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, <NUM> Lower Abbey street (W.	1551.9700877312632
and E.	103.82897063028229
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	946.0152993028172
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	3126.915648502007
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	901.1228943603298
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	717.008214891454
and T.	109.78576985707478
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	1306.3217133215053
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	402.839645909597
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	539.5145648196236
Never.	120.7455252415449
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	1312.4792127846372
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	2173.602863770749
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	2043.982142068295
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	2597.519675059219
Why did he desist from speculation?	1346.2511830381825
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	1148.0399583756007
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	1229.4395331233402
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	1426.9824956346938
Not verbally.	569.348016927964
Substantially.	412.94388766377165
What comforted his misapprehension?	1419.6729654924216
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	850.2315497121897
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	947.3892066970443
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	6860.839216101594
What did each do at the door of egress?	463.36789014181977
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	315.3724234158771
Stephen put the hat on his head.	189.7697646423792
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	605.0844871790288
For a cat.	203.3641291268671
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	668.82636561622
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	2520.904599985007
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	1593.5580333760834
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	2233.6491977697865
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	4587.8030511483275
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	2434.808066192111
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	1685.0607060133182
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	761.4388858828871
Of a different order of difficulty.	543.9974877169452
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	2803.235247272972
And the problem of possible redemption?	662.4332277924551
The minor was proved by the major.	559.1032368576698
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	1115.0909536106815
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	2208.1574876221703
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	1223.9336743904335
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	940.3101003954816
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	436.41732184971823
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	1684.9124764466017
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	845.4749756397252
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	1663.745934424267
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	2636.857458711161
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	1416.9585288531584
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	953.421064570187
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	1790.1920117501509
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	755.6598628353477
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	1492.5588889643705
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	990.3541143758501
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	2224.1909993229615
Both then were silent?	765.0316335836916
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	1367.198888733924
Were they indefinitely inactive?	3366.602772354013
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	964.9509250112094
Similarly?	884.205033265537
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	1474.1250264654955
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	2014.477922556261
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	1041.192379597057
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	1931.788879199739
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	1643.981699934526
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	2370.490853861103
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	3153.585987335354
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	2199.150359973211
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	342.927648125308
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	1199.6983761869044
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	1138.3942564741149
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	310.25308166497484
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	707.1863440754581
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	931.1921706834908
Turma circumdet.	1384.824771129642
Iubilantium te virginum.	2297.591634063759
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	644.6286389159469
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	627.7492596005873
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	477.1451775533476
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	479.866865417564
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	974.0924390489715
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	496.89895865839856
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	2664.7306521288606
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	2225.7649714542163
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	2605.0304236467323
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	2182.061211890064
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	1101.013637279484
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	889.1928762855716
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	919.5410718419668
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	671.4007050118968
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	1104.2924896889635
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	1612.2136861288157
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	1111.644056560632
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	1028.568514708233
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	1329.1942803961622
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	2250.661206352634
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	845.1612983306607
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	1898.0269900570124
Describe them.	360.9497936942845
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	2172.4256445008064
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	1793.6768986236086
What significances attached to these two chairs?	1760.329428238915
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	920.5173569862036
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	1352.674767277257
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies ’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	2058.2710173418823
Clifton Bingham, composed by J.	1368.8193736322025
L.	135.98939187633997
Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications _ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_, close.	2254.025761167089
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	2497.0459499332574
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	1986.3767457720296
His next proceeding?	1174.4726860999624

Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	1130.0243720412589

The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	2177.5211208957853
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	1062.9854868424738

Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	1797.65136584901
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	1910.4560468896198

With which attendant indignities?	1815.4322534241976

(Brian Cooper Tweedy).	809.1167012261814
What impersonal objects were perceived?	2162.938498480175

Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).	1086.190948239177
Bloom ’ s acts?	280.96055594891794
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	746.0220605780793
How?	170.2852263135594
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	1103.1127731051922
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	949.2395378977958
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	763.5272800411591
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	610.219601777817
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	1129.038035142497
What preceding series?	1092.295136363662
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	1755.6370914144636
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	424.59591006650993
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	1123.9556475695451
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	2019.9630840406724
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	1476.5529049533807
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	3526.6518245861225
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	803.2223059157294
Envy?	701.7939999806459
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	3326.003830643949
Jealousy?	884.205033265537
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	940.8825153314759
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	2101.7427321598243
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	870.4748611828045
Abnegation?	884.205033265537
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	2987.3070445391027
Equanimity?	884.205033265537
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	1333.6135532638707
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	875.9785757088752
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	2119.521864034243
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	2774.6576487774155
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	979.76545645605
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	2676.4114970195947
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	2468.3731633163784
What retribution, if any?	488.6806722802591
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	654.3899039263935
Duel by combat, no.	609.7634035999579
Divorce, not now.	282.41145945524386
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	3018.826900432848
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	2252.36530108314
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	1141.877487797705
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	1751.8040318024903
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	1122.2622824631278
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	2696.196538530858
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	2341.093643543572
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	1817.5837113398672
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	1245.0048535466942
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	2608.512824817372
Then?	168.69368248606727
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	3778.555921251815
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	1245.0048535466942
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	2281.8444465022694
What followed this silent action?	1015.268401973101
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.	5231.413779564147

Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown.	1204.2730027517623
Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn ’ s (Murphy ’ s) Hotel, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.	1355.8364420821267
Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?	2808.499871135516
Absolutely.	286.319300185858
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?	1467.126329179033
Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.	285.56271561261036
What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?	2713.037295246733
By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated <NUM> calendar month after the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth (<NUM> September <NUM>), viz.	1495.6957310696819
<NUM> October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born <NUM> June <NUM>, having been anticipatorily consummated on the <NUM> September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place <NUM> weeks previous, viz.	1468.4936782976404
<NUM> November <NUM>, to the birth on <NUM> December <NUM> of second (and only male) issue, deceased <NUM> January <NUM>, aged <NUM> days, there remained a period of <NUM> years, <NUM> months and <NUM> days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.	1045.4413525453663
By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, <NUM> September <NUM>, there remained a period of <NUM> months and <NUM> day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	1407.9954288613342
How?	170.2852263135594
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.	939.3569626119775
What moved visibly above the listener ’ s and the narrator ’ s invisible thoughts?	755.6426876041158
The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.	1446.8318054089589
In what directions did listener and narrator lie?	1384.8066900767349

• Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind

somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that

damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes

wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb pots of mixed plum and

the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only <NUM> or <NUM> Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM> st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day

couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	1180.6924725875585
