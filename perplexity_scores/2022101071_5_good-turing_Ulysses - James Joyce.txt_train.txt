176.48142498275695
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	14.694238905223433
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	26.090314329159618
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	29.8789656831027
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	11.098921211670083
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	22.293048745426827
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	15.328489028086722
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	9.960361089673137
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	34.94945302220628
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	97.24790096409383
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	16.318473184398332
Slow music, please.	154.27744248794457
Shut your eyes, gents.	20.342167379695837
One moment.	234.31031918078784
Silence, all.	183.1684056623006
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	14.535211687325393
Chrysostomos.	3279.475308279624
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	37.697990267776554
That will do nicely.	127.97531164928628
Switch off the current, will you?	55.693150474036834
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	20.080197879226233
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	23.18985586531598
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	58.2835823287953
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	59.66393260509417
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	13.724988217175754
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	10.591526132802914
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	27.25508557982359
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	44.17288421735628
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	38.30493016660229
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	55.693150474036834
We must go to Athens.	163.39452152054932
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	18.08685827401255
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	21.918128226854556
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	43.556098214080386
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	58.88265864995491
— Yes, my love?	431.5303014074171
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	62.52775631387825
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	147.39713408023388
he said frankly.	289.3046647810129
A ponderous Saxon.	726.5144068847064
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	67.72314411929322
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	24.865645192996855
Because he comes from Oxford.	63.62312586909833
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	35.45305833992611
He can ’ t make you out.	100.0440915064016
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	21.837543229052297
He shaved warily over his chin.	153.71030072150984
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	38.827459560322026
Where is his guncase?	337.14695490690383
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	110.82719127037605
Were you in a funk?	188.45196317927963
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	87.49116356649387
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	25.11665309478134
I ’ m not a hero, however.	52.99916810308703
If he stays on here I am off.	36.520982331023276
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	58.470224656930846
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	34.87916736842012
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	244.9036900782978
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	13.592773521346766
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	25.700770275698275
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	127.86012137410584
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	15.357322865367086
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	49.18885832323835
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	23.22235187389519
— God! he said quietly.	136.15339838796314
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	20.566894964798973
The snotgreen sea.	954.3116359862598
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	284.3169932778216
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	53.12305789614053
You must read them in the original.	30.030461180940353
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	29.75046079761603
Come and look.	200.59571535181212
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	58.62038351411961
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	18.797607466531996
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	34.69383802031901
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	60.16620974963423
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	53.672455806154176
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	16.338204775811196
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	92.43861185645186
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	21.09064038186863
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	82.59123106225785
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	24.15012834920158
And you refused.	70.88214192830117
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	43.062235326623814
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	129.14506950814115
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	62.17109188189756
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	14.537776300109707
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	14.809716842756584
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	19.28299016057313
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	10.314095606322184
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	14.972449936019727
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	36.906007916342965
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	14.906299048835544
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	127.86012137410584
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	47.500936257535244
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	42.83967908067719
How are the secondhand breeks?	59.18339777692688
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	95.85296909629024
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	89.7479041342478
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	95.68112079875287
Secondleg they should be.	154.27744248794457
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	31.258887833593622
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	87.68553700725509
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	90.59015702361823
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	73.36467514995341
— Thanks, Stephen said.	269.9801690516173
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	40.68438150002367
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	33.99859792936755
Etiquette is etiquette.	284.3169932778216
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	55.451562892877135
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	14.751901610234185
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	26.48705467367217
p.	1573.120718545661
i.	3279.475308279624
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	129.08550199579054
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	11.640710302766527
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	35.86731647962427
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	41.232812167689204
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	14.543764074422189
Hair on end.	161.2259711689697
As he and others see me.	41.01119178536779
Who chose this face for me?	160.87867160420097
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	67.78592843876655
It asks me too.	149.07019090684048
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	58.58638763440498
It does her all right.	70.71042376447427
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	66.79888779276757
Lead him not into temptation.	99.69176780614801
And her name is Ursula.	147.1095579819005
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	23.389676291930943
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	30.787625657425764
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	14.28361705497741
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	175.6898734247388
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	16.767946248205657
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	27.871785825984894
he said kindly.	289.3046647810129
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	32.647632830771684
Parried again.	711.3009653190022
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	36.97843128844294
The cold steel pen.	263.77608535074137
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	27.42805665481007
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	50.62275371171851
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	25.622117209728287
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	15.554880896219833
Hellenise it.	711.3009653190022
Cranly ’ s arm.	92.68823457328038
His arm.	1675.8268253234894
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	92.21195206837436
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	32.809620094984815
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	142.71913855369743
What have you up your nose against me?	59.5706351665708
Is it Haines?	127.59377034464403
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	13.921173194242915
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	24.896088705659746
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	22.989666103795667
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	10.383312883470452
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	58.89699035871132
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	20.266023691306188
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	16.761419086279037
To ourselves...	439.81893424216906
new paganism...	154.27744248794457
omphalos.	3279.475308279624
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	99.82182914793181
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	26.570130760813697
— Then what is it?	202.20146489135038
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	415.9322396977943
Cough it up.	284.3169932778216
I ’ m quite frank with you.	108.21366346676558
What have you against me now?	100.83009221589667
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	17.309481272778946
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	269.02215612632904
— Do you wish me to tell you?	95.92738565173819
he asked.	136.3611024919681
— Yes, what is it?	258.96134769861413
I don ’ t remember anything.	283.29154205783743
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	68.4452022292283
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	18.947835585449113
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	16.634469806264143
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	73.28956576011984
Where?	3823.0177472484206
I can ’ t remember anything.	87.73661070817802
I remember only ideas and sensations.	95.78296307654576
Why?	3668.761700153618
What happened in the name of God?	106.8831994242752
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	27.366561268343403
She asked you who was in your room.	66.02346424725762
— Yes?	4201.878980949647
Buck Mulligan said.	524.2141634607332
What did I say?	1411.530369219276
I forget.	2996.151545654079
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	18.570461457432014
— Did I say that?	298.93312655621827
he asked.	136.3611024919681
Well?	718.5104671570921
What harm is that?	258.9504717211181
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	109.4915174924078
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	37.56987294311798
You saw only your mother die.	171.21318635476132
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	18.998570955140416
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	26.96202318320545
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	70.02340573911958
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	23.237810606676614
Why?	3668.761700153618
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	48.39234257674018
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	53.43156447584021
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	32.71525060522383
Humour her till it ’ s over.	43.62316795256754
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	28.241188018102555
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	34.65761793055778
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	37.5706306094456
He had spoken himself into boldness.	103.05288272307327
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	14.80043131455057
— Of what then?	559.5574536742909
Buck Mulligan asked.	524.2141634607332
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	64.66106132005808
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	118.6813608567436
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	76.33607636064409
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	87.2988891209328
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	34.89316157926635
Sea and headland now grew dim.	50.40191784567241
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	17.96476435648045
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	29.300426857071088
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	122.45408021825305
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	73.0019134546983
What does it care about offences?	31.125140333106227
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	153.14632269331
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	12.037416412927783
I ’ m inconsequent.	417.85240075671015
Give up the moody brooding.	97.50466275687131
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	10.915306155949528
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	21.346692336730378
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	21.346692336730378
White breast of the dim sea.	40.21643781852609
The twining stresses, two by two.	109.1343468108211
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	41.18653726724317
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	45.42570298685798
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	21.787975396373852
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	27.38622761616404
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	17.434761590440374
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	24.793472341556306
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	27.86044346574022
She was crying in her wretched bed.	87.74710383330769
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	32.44103463812589
Where now?	4103.048991415154
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	14.118859863066728
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	16.968172961783708
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	55.693150474036834
And no more turn aside and brood.	75.36618632485849
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	33.46196676388118
Memories beset his brooding brain.	99.69176780614801
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	20.564282820940253
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	20.67506099864242
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	17.625143899951404
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	12.013554309382455
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	19.342246638835316
On me alone.	1045.0911334067425
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	153.14632269331
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	71.85002890012079
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	19.692424694545704
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	26.990722097089957
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	12.216241346184525
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	48.3657658920976
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	40.1906667588589
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	17.57461650751378
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	66.85277601932464
Breakfast is ready.	284.3169932778216
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	38.41457461085877
It ’ s all right.	38.968114896218076
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	123.70745263173151
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	51.71781559537368
For my sake and for all our sakes.	33.765564161537746
His head disappeared and reappeared.	37.31322053090945
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	171.23138299482304
He says it ’ s very clever.	85.76219546386494
Touch him for a quid, will you?	34.23667771378933
A guinea, I mean.	194.84482612077056
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	181.47531679906552
— The school kip?	493.57815900962555
Buck Mulligan said.	524.2141634607332
How much?	164.88460219192285
Four quid?	232.29930891778383
Lend us one.	183.1684056623006
— If you want it, Stephen said.	90.90040795098011
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	63.10061801610324
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	36.17867354446792
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	116.14444244447664
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	10.802799538323905
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	55.42059883550668
Why should I bring it down?	171.47901874904997
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	70.0577935184432
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	14.519007431172795
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	20.199156816648216
I am another now and yet the same.	160.90678003471908
A server of a servant.	142.32933231834676
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	16.04711305307003
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	11.46978859731078
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	51.443175566308966
Haines, open that door, will you?	29.308465522552748
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	94.41468831163309
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	16.589135941849783
— Have you the key?	198.79563877594174
a voice asked.	165.49959036625415
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	98.16463229457094
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	19.256548190528544
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	38.41457461085877
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	39.17370852210056
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	50.23109722587445
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	18.50181424426787
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	66.4559149300446
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	17.1744462902672
Haines, come in.	74.32269873372958
The grub is ready.	423.1963682690693
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	35.45171885100945
Where ’ s the sugar?	142.65948340946107
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	93.7640174901086
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	32.12581798618315
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	72.03576773912184
— What sort of a kip is this?	124.24067409791768
I told her to come after eight.	75.21041769432999
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	68.79693372141993
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	31.31134990272746
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	40.75823262313116
I want Sandycove milk.	409.1941169174772
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	16.586401653419415
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	28.532898884203643
Sit down.	193.2974044776159
Pour out the tea there.	99.69176780614801
The sugar is in the bag.	153.14632269331
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	21.62029234424728
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	14.945454945988509
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	77.59868418988833
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	33.7850093738274
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	13.801244133830114
And when I makes water I makes water.	51.47372670940021
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	50.893917271115676
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	24.038484088194302
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	13.456569767333447
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	51.119409726477016
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	16.46768562528368
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	29.09443892302739
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	11.061444147595228
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	233.62336249272516
— Do you now?	536.2541714937116
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	116.5188883216325
Your reasons, pray?	112.69938353344392
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	37.453483005080315
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	11.010282365464946
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	27.25508557982359
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	26.99336156494728
Do you think she was?	61.608780496154615
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	10.828255742702819
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	25.166818837481614
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	83.2233814680901
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	36.84152014790877
Kinch, get the jug.	64.41582805787725
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	18.7506931977316
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	52.60034474398697
Glory be to God.	95.28046934674923
— To whom?	992.4691141399471
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	42.67973263587102
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	37.843114287886856
— How much, sir?	223.44781696609544
asked the old woman.	85.23927371706415
— A quart, Stephen said.	155.8213833989802
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	21.358440174545873
Old shrunken paps.	166.7996882428697
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	66.02346424725762
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	19.330200199421814
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	48.84285931581692
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	13.972212963127022
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	53.06302408812582
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	22.235056512370488
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	16.058485666169727
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	24.86236992008191
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	32.94800303129858
— Taste it, sir, she said.	121.42642396666892
He drank at her bidding.	122.48726273997825
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	24.99318969745914
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	14.68431840590235
— Are you a medical student, sir?	78.80676537800349
the old woman asked.	82.62216172680085
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	79.7623631120884
— Look at that now, she said.	33.97765102081911
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	269.02215612632904
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	19.559637415451494
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	24.732858616902803
— Do you understand what he says?	94.61393912914313
Stephen asked her.	1172.1634538409776
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	58.68613333644895
the old woman said to Haines.	49.05138661204595
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	29.0991368063723
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	247.79288888640667
Is there Gaelic on you?	77.88070207644914
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	58.03629643908795
Are you from the west, sir?	126.30065486709597
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	146.85799437647123
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	43.232631793597314
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	34.39290169071368
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	66.73969829950067
Wonderful entirely.	222.84695499185113
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	34.65761793055778
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	26.196944429729495
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	30.81018526380846
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	22.973483329706944
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	18.948193008302297
Stephen filled again the three cups.	130.11262752235126
— Bill, sir?	791.3955546268766
she said, halting.	92.68823457328038
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	11.381525514099836
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	20.759505018533964
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	15.913045337162579
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	49.64853140797185
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	26.177009462581108
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	14.423276933162398
All I can give you I give.	47.539442697157575
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	73.04923244433556
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	64.90982273395541
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	88.55093414644999
Time enough.	160.39177273354773
Good morning, sir.	90.18163723225334
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	14.111907983122492
I ’ m stony.	417.85240075671015
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	24.643430865115437
Today the bards must drink and junket.	52.49207812448908
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	22.944844380630535
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	27.102626338407273
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	35.02088804373769
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	17.904724452000423
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	22.309872094151796
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	21.42243995468978
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	11.459575516572308
Speaking to me.	165.49959036625415
They wash and tub and scrub.	143.47880384918665
Agenbite of inwit.	18.27290464724234
Conscience.	3279.475308279624
Yet here ’ s a spot.	52.60144848788969
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	33.04520161796004
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	18.121330815366996
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	75.63320060979848
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	52.48808046178988
— Would I make any money by it?	89.2461869741787
Stephen asked.	792.1898455895542
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	20.70731523254315
He strolled out to the doorway.	131.39150132787535
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	21.65483899762547
— Well?	8111.317158926999
Stephen said.	1413.9890712757874
The problem is to get money.	153.14632269331
From whom?	613.7375709238547
From the milkwoman or from him.	41.31563632144963
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	26.96202318320545
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	28.8290023506339
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	40.35718958351395
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	36.76514565790839
— From me, Kinch, he said.	97.24790096409383
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	19.024868509172137
Damn all else they are good for.	38.800325990672775
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	92.03529924454818
To hell with them all.	158.1132107105492
Let us get out of the kip.	73.94624397560823
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	15.377103619221668
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	87.79746004479809
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	122.82968109036256
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	19.646667999328066
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	22.84852627317095
I want puce gloves and green boots.	83.58631285272894
Contradiction.	3279.475308279624
Do I contradict myself?	147.36724904469006
Very well then, I contradict myself.	35.86253540224605
Mercurial Malachi.	711.3009653190022
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	49.467358366014
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	77.2086195134546
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	101.57899430028266
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	20.98548660795188
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	72.44189724812709
Come out, Kinch.	103.72620530677513
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	46.009739943774505
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	15.114749729883131
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	15.879747508422406
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	41.96291960307849
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	50.903277478882
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	159.10715822600957
He walked on.	280.24418414973934
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	9.35288736467827
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	22.198572385258682
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	167.38767130477493
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	35.24429100593438
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	18.66846931812253
Martello you call it?	154.27744248794457
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	38.864033322777516
But ours is the _omphalos_.	219.35562064258886
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	106.37157052913447
Haines asked Stephen.	118.35474277526535
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	155.1012460868691
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	20.383506173075617
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	27.03907442406386
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	13.39972223453629
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	38.707072216589346
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	90.09600978377003
Is it some paradox?	79.12698932911927
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	244.9036900782978
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	60.354091471076515
It ’ s quite simple.	99.78164469689233
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	16.530993719169302
— What?	1708.7588479661683
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	28.92758113156834
He himself?	1878.9496072483732
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	13.288361533998057
And it is rather long to tell.	60.19824166655345
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	47.10509559164341
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	35.319031437850406
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	26.09466250149515
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	17.979464849034674
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	38.810542104049496
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	19.92850649344335
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	33.53754883703492
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	14.688338924301476
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	13.941859843150594
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	73.44197470479038
The Father and the Son idea.	153.14632269331
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	66.67026609741337
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	50.23109722587445
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	13.859836779906056
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	11.608309704595857
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	20.43740565969095
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	113.15234187323898
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	31.193296007793986
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	8.723983169189637
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	22.417550122644958
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	8.377858730877842
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	13.343997261487317
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	605.6237263733526
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	32.08764492310327
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	21.529752108143928
What did he call it?	153.36142763980328
Joseph the Joiner?	165.49959036625415
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	72.50637442941812
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	62.37038087095903
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	46.51235435660995
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	66.80015750674994
Haines asked.	237.8383910838677
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	29.208623304530356
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	31.484440655360793
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	50.36588046231655
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	19.3421056166525
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	88.0307286786697
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	38.41457461085877
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	12.326711084861426
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	72.84660801699788
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	29.82814377819207
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	27.28461660101914
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	23.997950621439777
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	31.721655348047815
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	23.514010534219608
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	22.17171156389607
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	17.992136426086002
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	35.86489380801817
He wants that key.	52.9050469919457
It is mine.	178.74358785631793
I paid the rent.	328.02654359608243
Now I eat his salt bread.	108.31640185119974
Give him the key too.	65.02021078283205
All.	1122.4771683659692
He will ask for it.	173.66933671006979
That was in his eyes.	300.6766673576252
— After all, Haines began...	72.60343769666727
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	14.765150195377363
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	33.69547801482944
You are your own master, it seems to me.	47.5752024588757
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	46.460757677425214
— Italian?	4010.904735824013
Haines said.	230.1863446600579
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	93.79034352900702
Kneel down before me.	154.27744248794457
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	52.737350722833696
— Italian?	4010.904735824013
Haines said again.	115.29852312121857
What do you mean?	262.7831382047415
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	24.30968661313476
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	23.863045883578142
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	144.06814385538652
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	58.211418455152014
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	40.36263490161908
It seems history is to blame.	70.49770122806935
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	12.377108272211768
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	11.615330271406163
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	10.506822249303436
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	22.989666103795667
Idle mockery.	711.3009653190022
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	12.110364158429437
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	50.40191784567241
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	15.360002436125095
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	32.94585172140611
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	30.946306719235544
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	19.925118308515657
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	73.15930906800261
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	41.45212755439481
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	94.13390242342156
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	21.057206385584063
It ’ s nine days today.	71.90670491154346
The man that was drowned.	108.07159414343182
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	16.520477343493596
Here I am.	191.19379313802767
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	49.71824816293839
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	26.12714244748347
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	15.808209713123057
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	202.73880654064655
— Down in Westmeath.	504.14488007389184
With the Bannons.	656.1478873279979
— Still there?	1146.949806419845
I got a card from Bannon.	103.44327247588006
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	29.12027470201147
Photo girl he calls her.	72.82237374211775
— Snapshot, eh?	791.3955546268766
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	72.03576773912184
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	34.84302552658982
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	16.33543712797073
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	45.42570298685798
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	57.618192744891736
— Going over next week to stew.	165.65170223267376
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	57.05709655084885
— Yes.	1687.0603916768166
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	93.80260945102032
The father is rotto with money.	153.14632269331
— Is she up the pole?	613.5022230585837
— Better ask Seymour that.	261.6026705257831
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	93.80260945102032
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	19.27921242401741
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	30.16041792956416
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	76.99050907764993
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	30.953038923955855
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	29.29640792933038
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	73.93596072432372
— Yes.	1687.0603916768166
Make room in the bed.	293.22091482913333
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	17.683257592534503
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	41.17172164253887
— Are you not coming in?	188.29960611940984
Buck Mulligan asked.	524.2141634607332
— Later on, Haines said.	244.9036900782978
Not on my breakfast.	95.34752991398447
Stephen turned away.	93.57827571143874
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	271.968333801046
Stephen handed him the key.	196.51403951865439
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	89.7479041342478
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	206.80659479335353
Throw it there.	165.49959036625415
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	91.01055928545487
Dressing, undressing.	183.1684056623006
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	19.60941588249305
Thus spake Zarathustra.	161.2259711689697
His plump body plunged.	394.0455867117899
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	21.019971066115666
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	12.862226618940431
Half twelve.	352.95242185605395
— Good, Stephen said.	298.07687701385794
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	90.50854580770391
Liliata rutilantium.	711.3009653190022
Turma circumdet.	345.2276592150924
Iubilantium te virginum.	134.29611024360622
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	25.660580262035356
I will not sleep here tonight.	82.16663274369067
Home also I cannot go.	72.82237374211775
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	13.878830743377025
It called again.	272.8405208532208
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	24.391193860038317
Usurper.	3279.475308279624
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	58.2945131150448
— Tarentum, sir.	791.3955546268766
— Very good.	632.1289920939663
Well?	718.5104671570921
— There was a battle, sir.	205.57767056385765
— Very good.	632.1289920939663
Where?	3823.0177472484206
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	43.75401964470213
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	54.58606516877998
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	30.84119529718539
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	26.090314329159618
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	20.23842399362018
What ’ s left us then?	122.13859760426901
— I forget the place, sir.	343.5897862448562
<NUM> B.	4463.15643966163
C.	417.9052384715969
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	49.993774349432655
— Yes, sir.	317.3803834839747
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	19.01758036041109
A dull ease of the mind.	129.14506950814115
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	15.398749898602691
Any general to any officers.	53.58879228020047
They lend ear.	859.7656663119578
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	116.74458357767284
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	90.88523689400678
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	244.9036900782978
— I know, sir.	708.6391617795189
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	14.989966308822304
— Wait.	4066.5900292738456
You, Armstrong.	734.8978645296431
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	68.0702260517443
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	42.67779103330059
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	41.53928854123248
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	36.460744362930896
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	129.14506950814115
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	26.898613627813717
Vico Road, Dalkey.	154.27744248794457
— Pyrrhus, sir?	791.3955546268766
Pyrrhus, a pier.	106.94871078683059
All laughed.	655.8145920333396
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	154.27744248794457
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	29.75046079761603
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	16.25680510666685
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	25.353422617227825
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	84.38431782437581
A thing out in the water.	98.11438197467672
A kind of a bridge.	194.84482612077056
Kingstown pier, sir.	154.27744248794457
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	33.09364039110377
Two in the back bench whispered.	56.91118432821268
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	53.06302408812582
All.	1122.4771683659692
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	34.024046416682744
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	14.937688848991902
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	244.9036900782978
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	453.95832970822994
The words troubled their gaze.	172.94128814290227
— How, sir?	620.9790731699773
Comyn asked.	711.3009653190022
A bridge is across a river.	129.14506950814115
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	96.04641417451343
No - one here to hear.	81.5558862119269
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	17.79339618231513
What then?	3042.1608973833618
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	20.67506099864242
Why had they chosen all that part?	120.67292055248028
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	65.92154340375276
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	16.056491873243008
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	15.345417710013518
They are not to be thought away.	63.325087715721175
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	15.923012949356337
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	45.489493744248726
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	53.05904904023557
Weave, weaver of the wind.	71.85002890012079
— Tell us a story, sir.	93.7624501305731
— O, do, sir.	201.17874039132218
A ghoststory.	2298.027198408115
— Where do you begin in this?	100.22803936755392
Stephen asked, opening another book.	132.3038976748806
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	121.15919031487381
— And the story, sir?	119.19786765059233
— After, Stephen said.	286.71942599671695
Go on, Talbot.	70.67107904752022
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	26.090314329159618
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	12.257787196543644
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	10.634917208652384
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	23.79372813111897
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	11.118170360066534
Thought is the thought of thought.	46.044729880055215
Tranquil brightness.	711.3009653190022
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	26.206139885859656
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	33.46196676388118
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	13.11966872493639
I don ’ t see anything.	275.6242494690907
— What, sir?	509.65245983292897
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	51.232820204380715
His hand turned the page over.	81.25248046990666
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	40.11412351750617
Of him that walked the waves.	74.54188151667464
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	16.26124809067871
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	22.543526966454824
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	30.896462962335526
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	17.954288927164182
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	26.570675480584807
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	34.65761793055778
— Have I heard all?	1186.5054360361005
Stephen asked.	792.1898455895542
— Yes, sir.	317.3803834839747
Hockey at ten, sir.	99.69176780614801
— Half day, sir.	83.28084743214202
Thursday.	939.5186216197353
— Who can answer a riddle?	238.89889314901222
Stephen asked.	792.1898455895542
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	45.533508183516055
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	18.15729194879218
— O, ask me, sir.	128.77312704840844
— A hard one, sir.	155.8213833989802
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	18.135053370410652
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	20.164361930328496
What is that?	535.0386673105033
— What, sir?	509.65245983292897
We didn ’ t hear.	265.52360097611984
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	24.04060873931638
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	33.0832924337864
We give it up.	431.00459687264413
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	21.46688661084837
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	24.17949882119308
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	15.638956992473071
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	14.771889415661336
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	21.288767513393463
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	21.573123710285643
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	11.278596869190585
He held out his copybook.	170.215015638875
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	66.79888779276757
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	16.52600869808375
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	55.693150474036834
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	21.771960390551975
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	120.53804640727805
Futility.	3279.475308279624
— Do you understand how to do them now?	59.31980807828815
he asked.	136.3611024919681
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	121.15919031487381
— Can you do them yourself?	167.1232849514109
Stephen asked.	792.1898455895542
— No, sir.	2630.7934130406616
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	16.704999938740684
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	17.6966692980274
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	34.44197647297052
Was that then real?	323.18463389628755
The only true thing in life?	126.87912202707196
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	35.86731647962427
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	17.802300286982565
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	27.172150163128862
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	11.697783169641438
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	11.50971343365047
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	29.112476791806145
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	43.62316795256754
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	19.05511760278557
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	13.041614263511276
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	18.900021455089846
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	11.897181111465349
— Do you understand now?	197.0474105783758
Can you work the second for yourself?	35.22126069588998
— Yes, sir.	317.3803834839747
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	69.22740389128882
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	13.195911611215232
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	39.077658232509094
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	22.32492075660082
My childhood bends beside me.	74.93230833215537
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	45.14480702662443
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	14.055975425345652
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	12.6629026100944
The sum was done.	423.1963682690693
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	43.91013789766626
— Yes, sir.	317.3803834839747
Thanks, Sargent answered.	95.14563547931701
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	24.612826292208606
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	19.85508390924646
— Yes, sir.	317.3803834839747
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	35.948041815829185
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	93.80260945102032
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	19.90386975810454
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	19.455601505944053
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	37.575562612046866
He turned his angry white moustache.	269.64474732288244
he cried continually without listening.	101.9134049291679
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	53.62169207383915
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	24.32010688294671
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	19.595917740065584
What is it now?	274.93509236006827
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	12.54917338108699
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	16.973094948692264
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	33.43517383828903
As it was in the beginning, is now.	35.682001356800114
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	22.32442085617817
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	18.19787036795352
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	42.67779103330059
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	29.75046079761603
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	63.10061801610324
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	31.93726578872352
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	58.422693340833604
And now his strongroom for the gold.	69.5549105118249
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	12.124066498352578
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	17.844943831870353
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	28.1297777275623
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	35.36871908122744
These are handy things to have.	39.137487389988074
See.	379.34392767043016
This is for sovereigns.	101.18821727156539
This is for shillings.	101.18821727156539
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	284.3169932778216
And here crowns.	556.9197402181511
See.	379.34392767043016
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	54.73898341468132
— Three twelve, he said.	171.79694784239172
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	50.11467029809598
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	23.15937873863099
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	184.81412950771934
You have earned it.	309.2794451489538
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	38.576885596319535
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	60.151929559078155
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	37.60492156329145
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	75.3561432157882
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	47.032287135806556
You just buy one of these machines.	94.39007334348857
You ’ ll find them very handy.	87.68553700725509
Answer something.	410.5471886343227
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	93.80260945102032
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	29.059019458714822
Three times now.	192.7231491029608
Three nooses round me here.	75.51593951540964
Well?	718.5104671570921
I can break them in this instant if I will.	44.86203711763052
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	46.060825732520854
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	40.273466489150216
When you have lived as long as I have.	46.19325872235548
I know, I know.	176.71470602248138
If youth but knew.	157.96233514448073
But what does Shakespeare say?	149.0347055089859
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	29.75046079761603
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	24.889301961495168
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	139.07275513221583
He made money.	104.8999354299066
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	58.89699035871132
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	26.859275903092215
The seas ’ ruler.	293.36956372985253
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	20.432815945792143
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	65.44921172589378
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	244.9036900782978
That ’ s not English.	67.82792153346213
A French Celt said that.	194.84482612077056
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	85.76219546386494
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	50.40014147929273
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	30.06571936269872
_ — I paid my way.	45.136386320480845
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	31.995443260374042
_I owe <URL> Can you?	67.73263075336398
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	16.038856851092874
Curran, ten guineas.	154.27744248794457
McCann, one guinea.	154.27744248794457
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	72.82237374211775
Temple, two lunches.	154.27744248794457
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	12.017999399891144
The lump I have is useless.	153.14632269331
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	58.88265864995491
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	24.85801040027265
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	118.87057646407256
But one day you must feel it.	76.14189028038862
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	40.39723135110933
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	12.603126623766972
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	33.829691194462136
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	35.71430111607712
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	56.325498224131586
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	11.380542937960037
You fenians forget some things.	268.9319832222862
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	51.232820204380715
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	36.906007916342965
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	27.86044346574022
The black north and true blue bible.	85.48243185742561
Croppies lie down.	284.3169932778216
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	269.02215612632904
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	115.41327340115335
On the spindle side.	330.03332709268506
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	26.657732334393398
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	45.19702711106016
— Alas, Stephen said.	404.8637341755854
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	121.48427665644253
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	21.630782318913226
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	25.93657067345649
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	72.61433484527782
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	17.599936187669392
Day!...	59.47308732842273
Day!...	59.47308732842273

Lal the ral the raddy.	88.18344478206103
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	200.0108502106627
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	23.90706469631733
I have a letter here for the press.	48.44237528780917
Sit down a moment.	64.72680652418559
I have just to copy the end.	80.40123734295514
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	14.461776565259193
— Sit down.	1303.0466859240173
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	15.916420694765858
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	12.320290205351252
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	91.01055928545487
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	11.373349952853752
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	38.44965616942778
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	93.80260945102032
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	12.22390223886463
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	33.37437171936204
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	12.501816308847815
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	26.898613627813717
Again: a goal.	24.382490667828606
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	37.07682365948616
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	30.725310052481063
Jousts.	1575.979671522145
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	45.39328204042328
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	12.917146345776553
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	97.13547942443621
Stephen stood up.	619.2267163747952
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	95.9751371361
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	41.07601892877978
Just look through it.	141.4726443751868
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	41.65313754496384
May I trespass on your valuable space.	33.1904579463464

— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	298.7309378830377
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	39.05365435833357

Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	36.460744362930896
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	101.59878614339291
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	23.258519893993217
And it can be cured.	110.17760388827769
It is cured.	178.74358785631793
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	15.254397379036208
They offer to come over here.	143.47880384918665
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	101.71020643091296

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	30.875442124764497
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	80.29396129256479
England is in the hands of the jews.	48.94970032882251
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	48.71783035957622
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	31.133458042475983
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	26.898613627813717
I have seen it coming these years.	102.64724961077471
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	19.04547993329299
Old England is dying.	98.92273417185613
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	25.086993034626524
He faced about and back again.	104.30420051683166
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	56.95827510364017
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	29.248585204602996
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	23.468332003938972
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	21.83397998512867
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	156.5001585816631
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	20.44940372594314
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	26.204115232314557
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	21.58003820214898
Gabble of geese.	284.3169932778216
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	27.33976832567928
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	28.214903577938937
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	11.633015786836845
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	54.58606516877998
Time surely would scatter all.	76.64339824746683
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	42.67779103330059
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	14.51901167309596
— Who has not?	765.6295460341473
Stephen said.	1413.9890712757874
— What do you mean?	419.65357665192806
Mr Deasy asked.	84.17679231237447
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	38.259003440518626
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	145.16435036620675
Is this old wisdom?	166.85080075605381
He waits to hear from me.	138.06696066443104
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	36.63281810190628
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	29.177740400750938
A whirring whistle: goal.	194.84482612077056
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	65.2219584920093
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	56.70003018358838
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	24.121000484348396
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	40.712948008264625
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	45.42570298685798
Mr Deasy asked.	84.17679231237447
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	41.97442394944551
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	17.477052705920656
Looking up again he set them free.	35.3733916745072
— I am happier than you are, he said.	88.96409053069698
We have committed many errors and many sins.	60.354091471076515
A woman brought sin into the world.	27.41628149128595
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	12.688988408707276
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	16.116867854599555
A woman too brought Parnell low.	32.37125651936081
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	24.8725388811334
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	33.461941496601355
But I will fight for the right till the end.	36.90446209972905
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	37.5489052340219
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	101.97365496972319
— Well, sir, he began.	401.3527512966512
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	40.93128508590986
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	39.15191150964381
Perhaps I am wrong.	67.39179095174804
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	110.82719127037605
And here what will you learn more?	80.91300642975833
Mr Deasy shook his head.	71.40874428063505
— Who knows?	1943.8480911245151
he said.	141.38141645313658
To learn one must be humble.	119.75961953920586
But life is the great teacher.	143.25349723105114
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	269.02215612632904
— As regards these, he began.	98.89518567971005
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	671.4695267763154
You have two copies there.	180.94980533095136
If you can have them published at once.	27.9872593447927
_ Telegraph.	716.5075626637379
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	20.76150727997916
I know two editors slightly.	176.71470602248138
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	234.0256033206187
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	16.392766602653
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	18.332642192563544
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	20.461872977304257
What are they?	585.8056965972871
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	25.765184304463393
There is no time to lose.	39.23999734697349
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	43.99429020567447
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	44.136937757182835
Thank you.	135.8266345621182
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	55.16161258172515
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	34.15678558504711
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	39.032768376566175
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	14.13146913201179
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	28.143685879298417
Still I will help him in his fight.	34.51650996451518
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	20.47077610032868
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	98.89518567971005
No more letters, I hope.	79.72746424378309
— Just one moment.	352.0585785556475
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	51.29331985133842
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	27.54367304583214
— I just wanted to say, he said.	148.60077856082458
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	14.72619123212646
Do you know that?	92.86553830183301
No. And do you know why?	80.83684194792775
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	109.4915174924078
— Why, sir?	541.3623843636238
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	132.3038976748806
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	128.67674877209132
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	37.22301994245591
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	19.369775504789125
That ’ s why.	63.13924945326945
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	14.408498586485647
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	16.973094948692264
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	16.11036383964698
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	45.42570298685798
Limits of the diaphane.	154.27744248794457
But he adds: in bodies.	101.23813099513588
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	32.69667615922534
How?	946.9368407841936
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	42.32892322081312
Go easy.	382.07854487047706
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	29.334773853652578
Limit of the diaphane in.	99.69176780614801
Why in?	4051.55261467052
Diaphane, adiaphane.	284.3169932778216
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	14.252151630558764
Shut your eyes and see.	14.859450767584535
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	41.02639470428423
You are walking through it howsomever.	120.98707951947449
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	37.60492156329145
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	38.597262879709085
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	31.379776809022506
Open your eyes.	91.83756833177384
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	14.308845727375928
My ash sword hangs at my side.	44.60309288422465
Tap with it: they do.	71.39855225827199
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	19.768943272740334
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	26.707444882269257
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	32.27480182095279
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	55.693150474036834
Wild sea money.	165.49959036625415
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	71.85002890012079
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	20.18568389090406
Rhythm begins, you see.	99.71200660978897
I hear.	978.4942906077052
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	129.14506950814115
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	87.82996864158018
Open your eyes now.	60.161279293789036
I will.	782.2273272657666
One moment.	234.31031918078784
Has all vanished since?	112.79054408606683
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	56.24729391224086
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	35.45171885100945
See now.	2775.1547244690096
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	19.754082407321544
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	16.030957550965557
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	27.01350720623981
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	16.303233249301538
From the liberties, out for the day.	31.271927858297925
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	18.893948159668874
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	76.14307036831262
Creation from nothing.	183.1684056623006
What has she in the bag?	148.59060056533409
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	42.67779103330059
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	41.45212755439481
That is why mystic monks.	64.47965133455256
Will you be as gods?	52.993804710279306
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	133.70618190237417
Hello.	377.16781877608435
Kinch here.	573.8877874192854
Put me on to Edenville.	52.59468761573086
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	38.44965616942778
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	29.75046079761603
She had no navel.	194.70578793100148
Gaze.	939.5186216197353
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	13.66016889117477
Womb of sin.	183.1684056623006
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	29.75046079761603
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	16.806785247714032
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	19.456432442975842
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	129.14506950814115
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	20.96154679591862
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	72.61255917240048
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	60.151929559078155
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	24.649111540024546
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	18.130989779561002
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	38.44965616942778

Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately?	22.218349982160074

Sure he ’ s not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt Sally?	20.556246852948227
Couldn ’ t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?	19.721376891195415
And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	35.70935059672813
O, weeping God, the things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	23.761196950869536

Yes, sir.	993.1893581417909
No, sir.	278.6444415624925
Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ! I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.	15.625962460111168
They take me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.	28.126878872614455

In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	12.36059789758157
Cleanchested.	3279.475308279624
He has washed the upper moiety.	114.2063198914931

The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera.	58.71607913351107
Listen.	428.03632508877547
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	19.700941849425195

Beauty is not there.	24.382490667828606
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh ’ s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.	15.653877871927145
For whom?	666.410221643759
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	109.1343468108211
A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars.	17.59953585163304

A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace (_descende! _), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	16.004500284157338
Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	10.196602656921465
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	26.049097650640867
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	22.989666103795667
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek.	22.835668072001415

Isle of saints.	284.3169932778216

You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose.	30.725310052481063
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street.	17.638410122310773
_O si, certo! _ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw.	14.771889415661336
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women! _ What about that, eh?	12.857340630579682
What about what?	344.01028953571085
What else were they invented for?	148.59060056533409
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	25.121786637262968
I was young.	3709.602131271487
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face.	30.734743349006113

O yes, W.	47.61041007788526
Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	12.412510903978282
Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara.	16.853756633397754

The grainy sand had gone from under his feet.	66.67026609741337
His boots trod again a damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.	14.647349037066228

He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	27.807132962712362
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of brightness.	21.585792055030332
Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?	16.33442792179753
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	29.056205978899904
Turn back.	44.69066858595725
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	10.036370559948294
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	62.670253252813914
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	12.586571393386647
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	15.016441844033746
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	16.283205401465736
Who to clear it?	451.92301940532735
He has the key.	198.39305907925234
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	42.39060182129911
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	22.95680418751748
Call: no answer.	89.26558162626948
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	21.51943809869486
Take all, keep all.	63.30021370705873
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	27.961437828955532
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	16.231078995716246
The flood is following me.	236.75172691695573
I can watch it flow past from here.	64.57950163049803
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	25.4676098200419
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	20.080197879226233
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	49.467358366014
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	27.86044346574022
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	20.47077610032868
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	28.174779921044134
Hide gold there.	183.1684056623006
Try it.	144.81867718130366
You have some.	655.029968228811
Sands and stones.	284.3169932778216
Heavy of the past.	98.27978219799586
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	62.37152891860863
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	33.44843694684266
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	19.349999350408776
Feefawfum.	3279.475308279624
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	105.52660202594883
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	28.1297777275623
Lord, is he going to attack me?	33.19579386893509
Respect his liberty.	183.1684056623006
You will not be master of others or their slave.	47.34166422246257
I have my stick.	386.0297073506776
Sit tight.	193.2974044776159
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	20.618408262793405
The two maries.	614.805815344912
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	26.112934457789258
Peekaboo.	3279.475308279624
I see you.	589.1022505120964
No, the dog.	305.53702346771644
He is running back to them.	378.1519848238539
Who?	10733.252455985226
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	14.694238905223433
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	19.05511760278557
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	26.090314329159618
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	16.24791520454341
Famine, plague and slaughters.	99.69176780614801
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	27.259580578994377
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	22.39118104552232
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	44.99436748468229
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	30.81497164086781
Dog of my enemy.	106.94871078683059
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	43.13228506529064
_Terribilia meditans_.	711.3009653190022
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	33.698849530545374
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	24.62290081071112
Pretenders: live their lives.	99.69176780614801
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	11.70940379584236
All kings ’ sons.	146.14620725100127
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	54.58606516877998
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	29.112476791806156
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	23.614356853767145
House of...	24.382490667828606
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	151.2552337101353
Would you do what he did?	51.081473805431436
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	72.61433484527782
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	71.85002890012079
Would you or would you not?	51.081473805431436
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	25.595227353168124
They are waiting for him now.	108.52351419501873
The truth, spit it out.	116.34866789708383
I would want to.	250.80498802563065
I would try.	509.3816597648897
I am not a strong swimmer.	248.96547270296466
Water cold soft.	165.49959036625415
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	37.575562612046866
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	33.227187922831455
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	14.649568518290991
If I had land under my feet.	32.24407325034114
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	36.412630170541156
A drowning man.	726.5144068847064
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	40.20342523173627
I...	418.5732587986856
With him together down...	121.17869476961945
I could not save her.	118.91994812220125
Waters: bitter death: lost.	71.85002890012079
A woman and a man.	40.079762318421714
I see her skirties.	283.1124605346428
Pinned up, I bet.	72.82237374211775
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	17.536635625769257
Looking for something lost in a past life.	30.35877895107949
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	16.704999938740684
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	46.77199042030398
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	59.76742944923931
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	35.29477477907758
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	26.875913007397198
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	45.86194647189441
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	15.676489615569158
Cocklepickers.	3279.475308279624
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	19.38909847717193
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	15.703208516176675
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	14.694238905223433
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	25.622117209728287
The carcass lay on his path.	153.14632269331
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	14.358817049083516
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	23.84668947180585
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	48.42130096369984
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	15.504135887730266
He slunk back in a curve.	153.71030072150984
Doesn ’ t see me.	15.095643627856616
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	14.087603408578758
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	26.246731164872372
The simple pleasures of the poor.	153.14632269331
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	35.86731647962427
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	12.384854751385026
Wait.	365.9458717894147
Street of harlots.	134.29611024360622
Remember.	495.6528882363414
Haroun al Raschid.	183.1684056623006
I am almosting it.	1269.863116975029
That man led me, spoke.	49.5768916920374
I was not afraid.	1311.9164964056952
The melon he had he held against my face.	66.67026609741337
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	154.27744248794457
That was the rule, said.	96.8913992091961
Red carpet spread.	142.55177471040543
You will see who.	196.7199022550438
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	31.484440655360793
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	21.573123710285643
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	42.426873462578875
Spoils slung at her back.	99.69176780614801
About her windraw face hair trailed.	42.2957357935041
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	12.69690401411406
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	22.836481281069723
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	18.569459801942116
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	13.687849339372468
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	35.45171885100945
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	19.307078201220058
Couch a hogshead with me then.	71.85002890012079
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	119.3524379902979
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	38.44965616942778
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	71.85002890012079
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	28.52872933473371
Language no whit worse than his.	71.85002890012079
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	20.10486406634645
Passing now.	350.02061860370287
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	93.79034352900702
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	62.75233743538197
I am not.	2076.5495445315305
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	42.62439043404075
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	58.89699035871132
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	19.05511760278557
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	54.58606516877998
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	36.34354753667697
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	38.44965616942778
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	65.95694718610656
Here.	397.95024084096895
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	25.595475082053845
My tablets.	431.58920446298544
Mouth to her kiss.	16.902509535053788
No. Must be two of em.	80.83684194792775
Glue em well.	284.3169932778216
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	12.751686443704596
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	32.45863375209889
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	154.27744248794457
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	18.69956760541699
Paper.	3279.475308279624
The banknotes, blast them.	236.75172691695573
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	68.11226293301165
Here.	397.95024084096895
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	9.716258679602795
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	24.665288545927304
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	45.86194647189441
Why not endless till the farthest star?	105.3062207577192
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	17.381480408588143
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	11.42816202230974
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	32.71457752677828
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	29.75046079761603
Who watches me here?	451.92301940532735
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	86.56829749635875
Signs on a white field.	99.69176780614801
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	37.49960206727927
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	16.831635224505185
Hold hard.	143.74899586920517
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	88.48247981359451
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	15.653877871927145
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	46.082317429621575
Click does the trick.	154.27744248794457
You find my words dark.	268.9319832222862
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	38.44965616942778
Flutier.	3279.475308279624
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	12.127690026874223
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	48.84285931581692
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	43.85547101537389
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	37.14511517269383
She, she, she.	250.3317101578399
What she?	3042.1608973833618
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	20.64328325176721
Keen glance you gave her.	99.69176780614801
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	45.42570298685798
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	31.187273817916683
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	13.302684206285408
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	16.52600869808375
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	18.0097910458957
Where are your wits?	336.89004299076873
Touch me.	202.45941454181104
Soft eyes.	211.0500139360508
Soft soft soft hand.	68.63154182248914
I am lonely here.	1269.863116975029
O, touch me soon, now.	88.7494947898674
What is that word known to all men?	62.315033516861064
I am quiet here alone.	607.2039171886554
Sad too.	240.03748873294705
Touch, touch me.	96.2983901401645
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	15.224712995991942
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	16.229041838703154
_Et vidit Deus.	284.3169932778216
Et erant valde bona_.	106.94871078683059
Alo! _Bonjour_.	284.3169932778216
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	53.18418628134504
I am caught in this burning scene.	227.04125128767814
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	45.42570298685798
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	21.346692336730378
Pain is far.	165.49959036625415
And no more turn aside and brood.	75.36618632485849
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	27.202511333465253
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	30.531954223901174
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	41.45212755439481
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	19.87449651551466
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	13.867672802673015
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	81.51043782204218
He now will leave me.	237.74840479189962
And the blame?	562.7638347198152
As I am.	159.15110525396767
As I am.	159.15110525396767
All or not at all.	95.17079221139628
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	19.349079107220447
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	22.288431159326322
Better get this job over quick.	42.08768316326092
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	18.773519997973473
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	29.75046079761603
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	28.707606360695912
And, spent, its speech ceases.	60.19824166655345
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	26.50569529706198
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	11.027560217733695
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	19.13627684178719
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	12.62614997490153
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	24.86236992008191
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	13.242002186453057
Five fathoms out there.	97.18563025060972
Full fathom five thy father lies.	51.61664501767372
At one, he said.	259.0503089178982
Found drowned.	410.5471886343227
High water at Dublin bar.	52.59468761573086
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	21.346692336730378
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	23.99721860033746
There he is.	150.85655916677882
Hook it quick.	183.1684056623006
Pull.	1274.0642762518826
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	48.68606297837003
We have him.	501.89507869403457
Easy now.	711.3009653190022
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	43.62316795256754
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	21.731846235944744
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	29.081512483138056
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	15.159704057711382
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	15.58389379722583
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	93.79034352900702
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	38.44965616942778
Old Father Ocean.	166.7996882428697
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	55.693150474036834
Just you give it a fair trial.	41.17471118946218
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	431.00459687264413
Come.	429.0937688930336
I thirst.	2996.151545654079
Clouding over.	711.3009653190022
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	104.82908510121497
Thunderstorm.	3279.475308279624
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	19.05511760278557
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	38.50475019366888
Where?	3823.0177472484206
To evening lands.	999.4673397598074
Evening will find itself.	96.16032387952906
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	23.611371528296075
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	79.69601903526194
All days make their end.	95.17079221139628
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	16.76297689126208
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	18.808177149477412
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	110.06863543437261
_Già_.	1250.8558942273744
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	34.08052853437892
_Già_.	1250.8558942273744
My teeth are very bad.	74.93230833215537
Why, I wonder.	218.8949852360757
Feel.	548.9259526588894
That one is going too.	64.02873079108066
Shells.	3279.475308279624
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	25.873466425347022
That one.	327.7598036516414
This.	1070.9623838459052
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	99.69176780614801
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	33.484485550416764
My handkerchief.	431.58920446298544
He threw it.	483.9625666098843
I remember.	1264.0843066421971
Did I not take it up?	51.08347572257354
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	62.12652434346114
No, I didn ’ t.	152.67161211933984
Better buy one.	187.55125985493703
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	23.306136990184836
For the rest let look who will.	29.96273626736698
Behind.	81.91352909221612
Perhaps there is someone.	97.21513308787034
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	80.80932426631735
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	13.375218428393913
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	26.354376268615933
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	18.15265015658882
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	13.3175796904494
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	16.11036383964698
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	20.10486406634645
Made him feel a bit peckish.	18.0097910458957
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	21.321753488017546
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	65.06493771836993
Right.	375.323769667352
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	29.47008894352532
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	26.50569529706198
Cup of tea soon.	106.94871078683059
Good.	452.94603954592435
Mouth dry.	44.69066858595725
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	27.87047693010758
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	20.81961359108519
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	52.567236485280446
Prr.	1250.8558942273744
Scratch my head.	183.1684056623006
Prr.	1250.8558942273744
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	34.285142784722694
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	12.950344336817855
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	37.55020018201502
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	121.15919031487381
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	244.9036900782978
They call them stupid.	268.9407556140432
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	53.06302408812582
She understands all she wants to.	160.8057022664704
Vindictive too.	711.3009653190022
Cruel.	939.5186216197353
Her nature.	393.3646098247185
Curious mice never squeal.	71.16579439104393
Seem to like it.	154.27744248794457
Wonder what I look like to her.	40.52563799944825
Height of a tower?	154.27744248794457
No, she can jump me.	85.53016749996779
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	58.14154210525781
Afraid of the chookchooks.	133.70618190237417
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	34.111904343597196
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	22.39100405059623
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	27.97446513713741
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	13.517096105373643
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	99.90363336202603
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	21.358440174545873
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	20.193129591918193
Why?	3668.761700153618
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	56.94433907169432
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	75.66624049900426
He listened to her licking lap.	153.71030072150984
Ham and eggs, no.	72.82237374211775
No good eggs with this drouth.	146.3665910120375
Want pure fresh water.	153.10404402859862
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	20.295276089236413
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	36.460744362930896
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	36.894382079759446
While the kettle is boiling.	50.914594147216015
Why are their tongues so rough?	171.47901874904997
To lap better, all porous holes.	111.97372172429142
Nothing she can eat?	97.10422858228456
He glanced round him.	265.0720585597542
She might like something tasty.	182.86113044023546
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	38.44965616942778
Still perhaps: once in a way.	56.59872063937027
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	55.34744433241668
Be back in a minute.	73.93113805238326
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	33.79347308712873
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	31.94316931704431
Must get those settled really.	63.73198002411159
Pity.	423.13088219247254
All the way from Gibraltar.	60.3563712048225
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	64.53773798715243
Wonder what her father gave for it.	40.52563799944825
Old style.	365.21105831791834
Ah yes! of course.	91.26057881174879
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	34.65761793055778
Got a short knock.	74.59117251961185
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	30.125869643080378
Yes, sir.	993.1893581417909
At Plevna that was.	470.05432272071903
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	40.68531552235934
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	22.931379813970945
Now that was farseeing.	87.19669317391588
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	17.46900545700917
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	154.27744248794457
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	29.710303590491485
Course they do.	94.99669478036975
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	23.18985586531598
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	118.25737979377236
White slip of paper.	71.16579439104393
Quite safe.	407.3822321073414
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	33.4636123480544
In the trousers I left off.	119.3524379902979
Must get it.	151.97780837425316
Potato I have.	183.1684056623006
Creaky wardrobe.	711.3009653190022
No use disturbing her.	49.562029902176135
She turned over sleepily that time.	160.8057022664704
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	16.2769074937145
Looked shut.	361.65629589290785
All right till I come back anyhow.	42.076597487334254
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	15.286628956259142
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	40.4172498984016
Be a warm day I fancy.	38.80110953120872
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	45.42570298685798
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	18.027135634864322
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	45.067306571612036
Make a picnic of it.	49.12833712811572
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	45.86194647189441
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	16.704999938740684
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	17.828130175912396
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	24.533662757933147
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	21.543801140997914
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	10.599133446815136
Wander through awned streets.	154.27744248794457
Turbaned faces going by.	154.27744248794457
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	9.764819013626836
Cries of sellers in the streets.	54.58606516877998
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	33.86876418543838
Dander along all day.	154.27744248794457
Might meet a robber or two.	70.39474191084835
Well, meet him.	111.51667001052793
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	26.78187191814416
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	42.67779103330059
I pass on.	578.7071761221847
Fading gold sky.	284.3169932778216
A mother watches me from her doorway.	93.79034352900702
She calls her children home in their dark language.	56.56530880688228
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	41.06049749179847
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	20.232676224861496
Strings.	3279.475308279624
Listen.	428.03632508877547
I pass.	1729.3124201497578
Probably not a bit like it really.	32.45507888708859
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	23.146116453575686
Sunburst on the titlepage.	154.27744248794457
He smiled, pleasing himself.	35.723944412171065
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	17.942158265105007
He prolonged his pleased smile.	237.74840479189962
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	29.99866823573928
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	76.95774789069841
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	21.16455203207459
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	15.289601341625891
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	27.044009779703774
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	23.584096303973066
g.	1250.8558942273744
as position.	410.5471886343227
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	13.878505286763403
Baldhead over the blind.	154.27744248794457
Cute old codger.	183.1684056623006
No use canvassing him for an ad.	26.123591801133244
Still he knows his own business best.	38.23735369329973
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	13.298279185837783
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	20.104354883002582
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	26.48124542396378
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	131.00301071523003
Do you know what?	88.55568333180847
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	26.206139885859656
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	28.2393416096597
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	29.660512172703072
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	11.367304369455917
— Good day to you.	292.83533106899523
— Lovely weather, sir.	295.74295665108735
— ’ Tis all that.	404.8637341755854
Where do they get the money?	131.10173573219512
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	15.997896564127965
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	23.459417213266192
Then think of the competition.	233.22955268237112
General thirst.	211.0500139360508
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	29.00259856847242
Save it they can ’ t.	67.76974081381377
Off the drunks perhaps.	71.16579439104393
Put down three and carry five.	41.06049749179847
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	33.37844139569902
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	31.82028337102694
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	23.16039086100564
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	21.778948185753514
Say ten barrels of stuff.	71.3347300973365
Say he got ten per cent off.	42.928464039447086
O more.	2927.9264458727184
Fifteen.	381.840419993744
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	69.94812884893717
Brats ’ clamour.	284.3169932778216

Slieve Bloom.	711.3009653190022
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	17.660671499009492
Fifteen multiplied by.	139.51072303843034
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	30.479185418005407
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	17.913790132531872
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	42.67779103330059
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	54.58515478593373
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	21.200885994999677
Chapped: washingsoda.	284.3169932778216
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	34.165114787921674
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	66.60895921884476

Strong pair of arms.	96.16032387952906
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	71.85002890012079
She does whack it, by George.	113.9728319569121
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	51.516555505325364
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	36.460744362930896
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	17.80206884566208
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	104.8391693934798
Moses Montefiore.	410.5471886343227
I thought he was.	327.9677725357873
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	38.44965616942778
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	15.088139003740123
A young white heifer.	214.78240265588667
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	10.355518234783482
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	17.23550017064074
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	58.71607913351107
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	23.18985586531598
— Now, my miss, he said.	92.20256833401271
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	37.8792177950501
— Thank you, my miss.	160.04562706782508
And one shilling threepence change.	36.961962514468695
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	161.96136515438494
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	28.507445634174132
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	36.65818103066144
Hurry up, damn it.	83.67617978478319
Make hay while the sun shines.	184.66969774419604
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	54.73898341468132
Sodachapped hands.	711.3009653190022
Crusted toenails too.	284.3169932778216
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	31.484440655360793
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	47.39778885945854
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	24.22431306598794
They like them sizeable.	241.8115185679843
Prime sausage.	711.3009653190022
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	47.436312492568234
— Threepence, please.	791.3955546268766
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	26.320033223793363
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	25.310229031689172
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	25.496427879243956
— Thank you, sir.	165.0700949387804
Another time.	315.41255193791585
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	48.227708189563245
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	85.76219546386494
No: better not: another time.	76.4910788864217
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	168.838812568426
— Good morning, sir.	247.23410235885376
No sign.	2951.7761514224244
Gone.	371.13860926029577
What matter?	3042.1608973833618
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	55.54017228483801
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	46.83079366526077
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	37.47916153200016
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	41.232812167689204
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	43.62316795256754
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	21.790848220178653
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	43.62316795256754
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	26.821815632009546
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	18.775787574301603
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	36.50828704114287
Bleibtreustrasse <NUM>, Berlin, W.	54.58606516877998
<NUM>.	343.4940826778605
Nothing doing.	205.00603685405957
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	41.46409117858387
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	711.3009653190022
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	43.62316795256754
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	43.62316795256754
I have a few left from Andrews.	64.60646480477014
Molly spitting them out.	120.28105352159994
Knows the taste of them now.	39.137487389988074
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	55.693150474036834
Citrons too.	711.3009653190022
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	23.97229315420191
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	143.96791872456743
Pleasant evenings we had then.	72.82237374211775
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	46.35516240318036
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	13.875630251661557
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	28.246323329462445
Always the same, year after year.	36.495592927191645
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	63.582365156476826
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	38.44965616942778
Must be without a flaw, he said.	38.19030525922692
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	19.751474452380393
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	14.694238905223433
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	71.29662526597934
How do you?	804.8720442605245
Doesn ’ t see.	16.902509535053795
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	27.39598376398532
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	52.508437270723896
Watering cart.	711.3009653190022
To provoke the rain.	439.81893424216906
On earth as it is in heaven.	114.78519246449429
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	41.37230945967363
Grey.	1330.846217134227
Far.	369.55043168665526
No, not like that.	121.66477832237597
A barren land, bare waste.	129.14506950814115
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	19.05511760278557
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	36.02543850468705
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	18.797607466531996
All dead names.	266.4311256987857
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	38.01149160999229
Old now.	365.21105831791834
It bore the oldest, the first race.	44.499454079473
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	26.090314329159618
The oldest people.	954.3116359862598
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	17.381480408588143
It lay there now.	103.33892289846005
Now it could bear no more.	169.02122400628713
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	17.93660157164953
Desolation.	3279.475308279624
Grey horror seared his flesh.	67.73263075336398
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	22.835668072001415
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	14.240245416945255
Well, I am here now.	39.511642474393746
Yes, I am here now.	74.63700273565068
Morning mouth bad images.	98.27978219799586
Got up wrong side of the bed.	37.596874612254695
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	50.26994742256099
On the hands down.	176.64783175218386
Blotchy brown brick houses.	154.27744248794457
Number eighty still unlet.	125.76758908023898
Why is that?	620.4744476707054
Valuation is only twentyeight.	154.27744248794457
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	24.649111540024546
Plasters on a sore eye.	99.69176780614801
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	30.896462962335526
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	42.022208360735696
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	15.285308337935117
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	20.10486406634645
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	32.45421688849959
He stooped and gathered them.	173.66933671006979
Mrs Marion Bloom.	589.6958913303645
His quickened heart slowed at once.	145.16435036620675
Bold hand.	252.25175082777767
Mrs Marion.	133.14863174776644
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	26.09202032194299
— Who are the letters for?	214.58577550336594
He looked at them.	164.21655170917498
Mullingar.	922.757229076909
Milly.	496.6725611206224
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	26.397911826808844
And a letter for you.	110.17760388827769
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	26.33374265925827
— Do you want the blind up?	100.09891492482015
— That do?	1881.1371180550684
he asked, turning.	154.1072371926544
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	47.05705211993228
— She got the things, she said.	95.88982864043456
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	22.050752946555544
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	76.81011964228925
I ’ m parched.	417.85240075671015
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	91.27119963176808
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	14.398717057412096
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	16.3957315606764
— Scald the teapot.	791.3955546268766
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	33.41207262828709
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	17.363200293340864
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	8.594698273567861
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	20.718650293226233
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	36.198600945262754
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	50.07729992641409
Kosher.	1250.8558942273744
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	22.606929874736924
Pepper.	1575.979671522145
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	32.43863779570637
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	17.16787022948223
The tea was drawn.	423.1963682690693
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	47.505126779801266
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	41.73878332904941
No, wait: four.	179.07139728362583
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	76.55412390830404
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	24.160549876251476
He smiled, pouring.	46.5928442888323
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	68.92095618353008
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	23.195156444434662
Poor old professor Goodwin.	80.78268326096743
Dreadful old case.	165.49959036625415
Still he was a courteous old chap.	38.23735369329973
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	33.46196676388118
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	63.90919368267097
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	22.461610939646302
Sex breaking out even then.	99.69176780614801
Pert little piece she was.	99.69176780614801
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	23.22235187389519
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	34.65761793055778
Everything on it?	161.2259711689697
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	35.502735827421866
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	16.603269197474056
— What a time you were! she said.	95.96895626825092
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	17.00602768812274
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	21.99714625508073
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	42.67779103330059
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	40.65623344807955
— Who was the letter from?	238.89889314901222
he asked.	136.3611024919681
Bold hand.	252.25175082777767
Marion.	1183.7192881469218
— O, Boylan, she said.	128.77312704840844
He ’ s bringing the programme.	348.3594393840077
— What are you singing?	350.7692876020006
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	244.9036900782978
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	27.865973773284903
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	42.80207726989864
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	27.940517896863163
Like foul flowerwater.	287.7304541224934
— Would you like the window open a little?	86.75897357935469
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	26.85986807848846
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	129.855204921866
I didn ’ t see the paper.	76.74019920437524
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	18.15729194879218
No?	6153.574812078534
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	23.459417213266192
— No: that book.	398.32891331653667
Other stocking.	315.41255193791585
Her petticoat.	393.3646098247185
— It must have fell down, she said.	102.72983518745335
He felt here and there.	158.54063750158457
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	106.94871078683059
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	37.19016999926139
Not in the bed.	95.34752991398447
Must have slid down.	75.06617016874763
He stooped and lifted the valance.	116.77713455008784
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	36.906007916342965
— Show here, she said.	174.62911168223235
I put a mark in it.	112.03068164845773
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	24.54058486690027
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	13.933616524050816
— Met him what?	791.3955546268766
he asked.	136.3611024919681
What does that mean?	50.56867707156138
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	54.73898341468132
— Metempsychosis?	4769.796449440028
— Yes.	1687.0603916768166
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	276.4193309057406
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	48.71678379297291
That means the transmigration of souls.	69.52771849452989
— O, rocks! she said.	128.77312704840844
Tell us in plain words.	189.8677674660844
The same young eyes.	293.36956372985276
The first night after the charades.	32.07942337666619
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	14.782544719062617
He turned over the smudged pages.	378.15569805892267
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	55.693150474036834
Hello.	377.16781877608435
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip.	154.27744248794457

Sheet kindly lent.	183.1684056623006
_The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath_.	19.941110813750992
Cruelty behind it all.	106.94871078683059
Doped animals.	711.3009653190022
Trapeze at Hengler ’ s.	99.69176780614801
Had to look the other way.	43.221062517293106
Mob gaping.	711.3009653190022
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	37.55978775424624
Families of them.	284.3169932778216
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	71.85002890012079
That we live after death.	70.13865581790323
Our souls.	232.21979768211116
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	45.8420834977254
Dignam ’ s soul...	44.54527693384861
— Did you finish it?	210.83457280257838
he asked.	136.3611024919681
— Yes, she said.	431.5303014074171
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	40.950394527496414
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	26.422092762071514
— Never read it.	645.1488260963257
Do you want another?	97.8654208380556
— Yes.	1687.0603916768166
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	37.11457527187473
Nice name he has.	67.21752361457294
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	35.133992530872874
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	14.907689992589528
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	77.68920447202626
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	23.46337103777101
They call it reincarnation.	268.9407556140432
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	17.53545684556935
They say we have forgotten it.	91.94767027766798
Some say they remember their past lives.	39.17062928193806
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	66.67026609741337
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	36.894382079759446
An example would be better.	261.87422449518056
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	83.2233814680901
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	18.20586047275436
Tea before you put milk in.	68.37612070409088
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	36.11542797944965
Three and six I gave for the frame.	28.163283167159694
She said it would look nice over the bed.	54.01641778770311
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	19.904035737903623
He turned the pages back.	665.17790257808
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	22.93397666854735
What they called nymphs, for example.	106.2437684618236
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	35.842509717071664
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	41.2437272428442
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	84.964269404132
Did you leave anything on the fire?	43.57536860615081
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	120.92166578202324
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	12.832150167986768
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	20.78526268559104
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	16.177376696800017
Only a little burnt.	66.6919120794421
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	20.914205901199278
Cup of tea now.	106.94871078683059
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	41.53928854123248
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	21.5238228402079
Done to a turn.	24.382490667828606
A mouthful of tea.	337.1606960464125
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	21.560495206150282
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	37.51803149011156
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	16.113361645524265
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	25.121786637262968
It suits me splendid.	149.07019090684048
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	20.47077610032868
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	33.12629977248078
They are lovely.	549.9938838636531
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	101.71020643091296
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	46.85714953602489
Will send when developed.	118.4229062836712
We did great biz yesterday.	240.49100882463858
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	25.121786637262968
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	23.491698068565086
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	24.395259606839414
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	64.17406034470307
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	23.40540401514853
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	10.761167649144921
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	71.31091673646993
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	33.242740643485625
S.	355.170570843061
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	37.45529822806015
M.	408.8867013473826
Fifteen yesterday.	292.1187024185887
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	33.24918719809889
Her first birthday away from home.	40.5931480501211
Separation.	3279.475308279624
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	16.46392084926396
Jolly old woman.	183.1684056623006
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	26.417894824319646
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	17.44724024919035
Well, God is good, sir.	44.85663527426434
She knew at once.	56.186037090089094
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	46.68419370813274
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	79.73483120207445
Excuse bad writing.	100.26305128398326
Hurry.	831.2657542937562
Piano downstairs.	573.8877874192854
Coming out of her shell.	45.30208878536031
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	35.45171885100945
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	23.503428679291822
Saucebox.	3279.475308279624
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	29.963822928043548
Twelve and six a week.	67.73263075336398
Not much.	304.43660437526796
Still, she might do worse.	48.52145856151793
Music hall stage.	144.71065490547954
Young student.	154.02362855723538
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	29.815748253260644
Then he read the letter again: twice.	68.57939738589775
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	39.51491960161577
But if not?	552.5045041299117
No, nothing has happened.	179.07139728362583
Wait in any case till it does.	56.881523402849815
A wild piece of goods.	194.84482612077056
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	42.80207726989864
Destiny.	1250.8558942273744
Ripening now.	711.3009653190022
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	24.437779095629512
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	19.13627684178719
Anemic a little.	284.3169932778216
Was given milk too long.	281.7774645066727
Damned old tub pitching about.	66.47866443302057
Not a bit funky.	54.311382261588456
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	24.793472341556306
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	30.669809257384838
Seaside girls.	711.3009653190022
Torn envelope.	410.5471886343227
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	20.68809314342478
Friend of the family.	154.27744248794457
Swurls, he says.	154.27744248794457
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	45.42570298685798
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	21.817163697344686
Milly too.	205.3573488012724
Young kisses: the first.	71.61202348649226
Far away now past.	346.79052253789314
Mrs Marion.	133.14863174776644
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	17.79339618231513
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	32.140117054418
Will happen, yes.	82.0935125085313
Prevent.	3279.475308279624
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	40.36096127113635
Will happen too.	133.35536931038266
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	62.85481739157104
Useless to move now.	16.902509535053788
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	54.58606516877998
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	51.61664501767372
Better where she is down there: away.	36.894382079759446
Occupy her.	711.3009653190022
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	42.368211549906285
Might take a trip down there.	53.480451272004366
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	38.44965616942778
Six weeks off, however.	71.0854547039406
Might work a press pass.	97.38745996843716
Or through M ’ Coy.	255.9275286209234
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	16.700881525410562
She looked back at him, mewing.	83.16303506519886
Wants to go out.	17.754538009916914
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	46.297138242427174
Let her wait.	657.3886205571168
Has the fidgets.	113.64785315725534
Electric.	1575.979671522145
Thunder in the air.	154.3128110539392
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	45.22237599816467
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	30.607360450626697
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	34.68338067293643
The cat mewed to him.	104.00278164742052
— Miaow! he said in answer.	229.79165010689056
Wait till I ’ m ready.	52.190022446117815
Heaviness: hot day coming.	99.69176780614801
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	33.83904882206644
A paper.	2298.027198408115
He liked to read at stool.	116.77713455008784
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	30.75882340839336
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	46.93401363850521
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	38.03600172418788
The cat went up in soft bounds.	73.48290664910556
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	33.256412828255215
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	25.8148696486178
Come.	429.0937688930336
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	20.783900323696585
No sound.	1432.6351586286457
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	50.81600631144255
The maid was in the garden.	153.14632269331
Fine morning.	211.0500139360508
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	27.591324663658874
Make a summerhouse here.	67.57001147191984
Scarlet runners.	711.3009653190022
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	27.476888392779525
A coat of liver of sulphur.	129.14506950814115
All soil like that without dung.	68.99073724601803
Household slops.	711.3009653190022
Loam, what is this that is?	55.693150474036834
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	33.33907412522226
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	16.022806927985595
Mulch of dung.	284.3169932778216
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	30.19180530290024
Dirty cleans.	410.5471886343227
Ashes too.	410.5471886343227
Reclaim the whole place.	154.27744248794457
Grow peas in that corner there.	71.85002890012079
Lettuce.	3279.475308279624
Always have fresh greens then.	57.89643620627889
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	92.18520383661858
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	69.52771849452989
He walked on.	280.24418414973934
Where is my hat, by the way?	77.9958662283153
Must have put it back on the peg.	29.484023853216815
Or hanging up on the floor.	163.94660946429175
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	122.00131367501204
Hallstand too full.	284.3169932778216
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	52.59468761573086
Picking up the letters.	106.94871078683059
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	99.69176780614801
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	41.333657468887594
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	54.58606516877998
Just had a wash and brushup.	67.3293586459105
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	40.97017389222082
Tara street.	523.5436006047171
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	22.408870264137466
O ’ Brien.	549.1035307173789
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	51.232820204380715
Agendath what is it?	125.76758908023898
Now, my miss.	345.1343974847026
Enthusiast.	3279.475308279624
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	71.19665162791243
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	23.184637713582585
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	33.776623275795714
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	18.15729194879218
The king was in his countinghouse.	116.34866789708383
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	18.15729194879218
Something new and easy.	73.75103390269555
No great hurry.	887.6195005876992
Keep it a bit.	76.6651176353417
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	36.167302694735945
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	31.379776809022506
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	20.32159596117613
Three and a half.	69.54594384119211
Three pounds three.	124.15997914311373
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	42.809357067911435
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	16.685120628532378
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	13.114035486478107
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	22.454676658572858
No, just right.	305.53702346771644
So. Ah! Costive.	167.0100085248652
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	90.31336208659901
Life might be so.	96.69654188981458
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	22.543526966454824
Print anything now.	284.3169932778216
Silly season.	240.03748873294705
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	20.27424176736749
Neat certainly.	711.3009653190022
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	22.235056512370488
Begins and ends morally.	106.94871078683059
_Hand in hand_.	284.3169932778216
Smart.	1330.846217134227
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	12.809171538335034
Might manage a sketch.	150.1251528565346

Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	20.354384927052628
Dislike dressing together.	161.2259711689697
Nicked myself shaving.	284.3169932778216
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	29.75046079761603

What possessed me to buy this comb?	106.2437684618236
<URL>.	445.34151401366177
I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	108.21366346676558
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	36.037840481925755
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	33.46196676388118
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	15.859869261825105
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	17.17376977525744
Washing her teeth.	183.1684056623006
That was the first night.	140.30358257903757
Her fansticks clicking.	177.00939881909616
Is that Boylan well off?	60.54052150879747
He has money.	596.7932769161713
Why?	3668.761700153618
No use humming then.	49.562029902176135
Allude to it.	284.3169932778216
Strange kind of music that last night.	40.637855059306744
The mirror was in shadow.	236.75172691695573
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	34.162604300201494
Peering into it.	284.3169932778216
Lines in her eyes.	107.91567258563879
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	54.43280363773771
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	40.637855059306744
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	28.42550950217321
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	24.649111540024546
Still, true to life also.	48.52145856151793
Day: then the night.	66.56046995568006
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	31.93726578872352
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	38.721019182788545
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	22.640628507072158
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	13.925671476576913
What time is the funeral?	202.31686097723338
Better find out in the paper.	55.39877700048943
The bells of George ’ s church.	110.6886312002089
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	84.66293045759687
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	25.26263990702826
There again: the overtone following through the air.	39.10941836701021
A third.	2298.027198408115
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	11.050097601522474
Could have given that address too.	48.17082893688871
And past the sailors ’ home.	109.37563023999905
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	45.66284784866796
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	15.132097520608788
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	22.95680418751748
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	53.39782121078741
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	32.526730605125735
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	43.62316795256754
Come home to ma, da.	76.04950237896658
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	40.95046369527936
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	18.15382570947175
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	27.86044346574022
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	109.37563023999905
At eleven it is.	470.05432272071903
Time enough.	160.39177273354773
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	24.251894824252105
Corny.	3255.6086411305937
Met her once in the park.	68.37612070409088
What a lark.	74.55861146590206
Police tout.	350.02061860370287
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	22.710546164842974
O, surely he bagged it.	121.36307274524188
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	54.58606516877998
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	63.784565856444445
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	16.56710009685943
Rather warm.	211.0500139360508
Tea.	808.5262989580134
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	48.5749986222197
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	23.296643595467927
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	12.805962611274774
Very warm morning.	128.7399644816596
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	24.903796443585936
Just there.	624.6093181402414
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	37.244796061947746
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	25.277303892358052
So warm.	3565.8146895717773
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	29.947707773189368
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	17.055017260515726
The far east.	954.3116359862598
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	11.818929202346684
Wonder is it like that.	48.3886810491041
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	14.720253816038973
Sleep six months out of twelve.	54.58606516877998
Too hot to quarrel.	516.437227080968
Influence of the climate.	154.27744248794457
Lethargy.	1575.979671522145
Flowers of idleness.	165.49959036625415
The air feeds most.	263.77608535074137
Azotes.	3279.475308279624
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	154.27744248794457
Sensitive plants.	410.5471886343227
Waterlilies.	3279.475308279624
Petals too tired to.	154.27744248794457
Sleeping sickness in the air.	72.83668329129662
Walk on roseleaves.	112.34803027336187
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	41.232812167689204
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	20.82398385113499
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	15.709583711009598
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	19.721376891195415
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	16.492707667224032
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	49.2632416413491
It ’ s a law something like that.	30.743101289156947
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	38.44965616942778
The college curriculum.	954.3116359862598
Cracking curriculum.	410.5471886343227
What is weight really when you say the weight?	65.54257227934026
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	71.85002890012079
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	31.484440655360793
They all fall to the ground.	109.00404888991488
The earth.	1865.1868048385204
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	19.9001424906174
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	137.66403411641699
How did she walk with her sausages?	45.90959925219731
Like that something.	144.26322676152125
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	11.044046539052902
Careless air: just drop in to see.	36.460744362930896
Per second per second.	106.94871078683059
Per second for every second it means.	43.62316795256754
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	21.373590013597916
Too late box.	132.43162634695705
Post here.	410.5471886343227
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	47.53700182730412
— Are there any letters for me?	164.42960551579938
he asked.	136.3611024919681
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	10.492100853037755
No answer probably.	571.8400679573409
Went too far last time.	72.82237374211775
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	36.906007916342965
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	55.55657705945614
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	29.34067015841082
O.	2428.4693463862277
Westland Row, City.	106.94871078683059
Answered anyhow.	711.3009653190022
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	30.531954223901174
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	208.47098526753138
Castoff soldier.	711.3009653190022
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	56.8633785256901
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	83.90466221461276
Pointed cuffs.	711.3009653190022
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	30.676574101844988
Redcoats.	3279.475308279624
Too showy.	4356.383081816867
That must be why the women go after them.	37.54179456329076
Uniform.	1575.979671522145
Easier to enlist and drill.	72.82237374211775
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	16.679414876939155
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	15.58389379722583
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	40.78878735655984
Mark time.	31.20997052122985
Table: able.	183.1684056623006
Bed: ed.	284.3169932778216
The King ’ s own.	261.395099033177
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	19.418870421832075
A mason, yes.	337.1606960464125
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	39.63412571869413
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	15.016441844033746
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	15.260924523559707
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	20.370246540025512
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	26.11568087982328
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	54.3715065252398
No. M ’ Coy.	160.95244533807445
Get rid of him quickly.	74.69506732078193
Take me out of my way.	48.28692962787569
Hate company when you.	96.16032387952906
— Hello, Bloom.	325.09021891933105
Where are you off to?	132.29047694000067
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	284.02435240760724
Nowhere in particular.	284.3169932778216
— How ’ s the body?	187.2036249807251
— Fine.	4201.775006195741
How are you?	137.01233074036392
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	60.48129774239458
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	17.974030210219688
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	108.49268505292272
Poor Dignam, you know.	69.33267612202394
The funeral is today.	423.1963682690693
— To be sure, poor fellow.	87.36474056002808
So it is.	665.1733830327281
What time?	1191.2638147744294
A photo it isn ’ t.	129.14506950814115
A badge maybe.	726.5144068847064
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	75.9266817766061
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	73.601559310235
Eleven, is it?	154.3106391372771
I only heard it last night.	105.14858970916248
Who was telling me?	44.11045689591398
Holohan.	1575.979671522145
You know Hoppy?	696.2594334371399
— I know.	7517.8644226085125
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	23.102708525289668
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	66.67026609741337
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	20.38453516245373
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	15.653877871927145
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	25.121786637262968
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	32.3577316560277
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	28.747942527065042
Handsome is and handsome does.	67.73263075336398
Reserved about to yield.	154.27744248794457
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	54.5928428376987
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	38.44965616942778
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	28.624655725976805
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	39.06010364552627
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	78.35301210780398
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	69.45845662843068
In came Hoppy.	660.3217378264005
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	13.972212963127022
Clearly I can see today.	99.69176780614801
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	71.85002890012079
Talking of one thing or another.	61.641993572180866
Lady ’ s hand.	77.4230768711036
Which side will she get up?	43.49518064940853
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	39.51769842601945
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	55.693150474036834
High brown boots with laces dangling.	41.06049749179847
Wellturned foot.	711.3009653190022
What is he foostering over that change for?	62.315033516861064
Sees me looking.	183.1684056623006
Eye out for other fellow always.	71.85002890012079
Good fallback.	463.1372813097385
Two strings to her bow.	76.37806324959439
— _Why? _ I said.	244.9036900782978
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	29.51711164443535
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	54.58606516877998
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	121.29003691081343
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	14.923581505785638
Getting up in a minute.	72.82237374211775
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	178.9137342604877
He said.	1336.9384479409982
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	39.65365638331428
And, faith, he filled up.	60.19824166655345
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	154.27744248794457
I said.	1729.3124201497578
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	52.10159955405073
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	37.14579154276859
_Yes, _ he said.	110.06863543437261
_He ’ s gone.	92.68823457328038
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	79.89313551500906
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	23.88280814242703
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	25.97417450079351
Lost it.	361.65629589290785
Curse your noisy pugnose.	98.27978219799586
Feels locked out of it.	99.69176780614801
Paradise and the peri.	106.94871078683059
Always happening like that.	81.83901386657818
The very moment.	954.3116359862598
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	20.063994781575516
Her friend covering the display of.	53.43156447584021
_Esprit de corps_.	284.3169932778216
Well, what are you gaping at?	44.85663527426434
Another gone.	315.41255193791585
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	28.397136010129138
The tram passed.	954.3116359862598
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	23.55442083190259
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	20.10486406634645
— Wife well, I suppose?	186.05878092647762
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	28.348376405497483
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	91.79938344886249
Tiptop, thanks.	183.1684056623006
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	23.282148201687633
Incomplete.	922.757229076909
With it an abode of bliss.	99.14083838951737
— My missus has just got an engagement.	97.49915701948875
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	97.35231643231016
Valise tack again.	183.1684056623006
By the way no harm.	48.17723693172799
I ’ m off that, thanks.	117.58064979013953
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	30.87348093599179
— My wife too, he said.	94.36785745305014
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	20.966217847257862
— That so?	879.0028989959808
M ’ Coy said.	94.86453585124566
Glad to hear that, old man.	35.34473952417519
Who ’ s getting it up?	74.83726909860033
Mrs Marion Bloom.	589.6958913303645
Not up yet.	247.72137914040727
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	34.20721749289948
No book.	2951.7761514224244
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	38.44965616942778
Dark lady and fair man.	16.703074473839205
Letter.	1274.0642762518826
Cat furry black ball.	106.94871078683059
Torn strip of envelope.	106.94871078683059
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	22.633046596610665
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	39.85500920395572
_Sweeeet song_.	711.3009653190022
There ’ s a committee formed.	45.12602869616535
Part shares and part profits.	55.36089380551384
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	26.229866195928096
— O, well, he said.	150.2175922189932
That ’ s good news.	99.83202083069385
He moved to go.	67.21188878515429
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	91.1217494015437
Meet you knocking around.	106.94871078683059
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	121.29003691081343
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	72.12226344919831
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	34.59358060137926
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	21.434350300006376
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	12.305869975844402
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	37.74837737844563
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	79.75109604819062
That ’ ll be all right.	32.43806564595565
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	162.71464917953367
Thanks, old man.	74.03441686606024
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	65.99855619681064
Well, tolloll.	192.59617237523702
Just C.	624.6093181402414
P.	3451.7979164444014
M ’ Coy will do.	65.66959620118236
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	94.16220128235429
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	29.416562912005823
The quick touch.	954.3116359862598
Soft mark.	211.0500139360508
I ’ d like my job.	115.02350659880614
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	43.62316795256754
Leather.	3279.475308279624
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	33.46196676388118
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	12.916396340732707
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	27.407620119419235
My missus has just got an.	46.36808140430483
Reedy freckled soprano.	284.3169932778216
Cheeseparing nose.	711.3009653190022
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	26.528026387047213
No guts in it.	398.4028579034586
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	48.90770538445664
Softsoaping.	3279.475308279624
Give you the needle that would.	53.5367638447035
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	43.50586558437609
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	28.09351049058633
Against my grain somehow.	125.76758908023898
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	46.044729880055215
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	40.9987877146945
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	25.534609350031992
Your wife and my wife.	76.16604259547216
Wonder is he pimping after me?	50.24536798954714
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	18.616845179503656
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	36.6700555682126
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	99.69176780614801
No, he ’ s going on straight.	83.7967481057032
Hello.	377.16781877608435
_Leah_ tonight.	711.3009653190022
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	275.2865191380726
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	99.69176780614801
Male impersonator.	711.3009653190022
Perhaps he was a woman.	67.10322490464206
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	492.0559497702007
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	17.53533751659546
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	10.42679400064372
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	29.12027470201147
And Ristori in Vienna.	389.72129441311597
What is this the right name is?	79.13116088220357
By Mosenthal it is.	137.1497553675217
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	15.407247896384131
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	11.40188756145309
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	16.052758335077492
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	17.434400216782453
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	24.90862040922729
No use thinking of it any more.	26.123591801133244
Nosebag time.	711.3009653190022
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	21.336042531550408
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	23.463909338656254
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	14.384462455108178
Their Eldorado.	384.55327630223553
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	16.691443350700307
Too full for words.	318.9473495987814
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	25.515267701009314
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	24.649111540024546
Might be happy all the same that way.	31.881674368069934
Good poor brutes they look.	78.01483747130429
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	52.403324187805644
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	24.889301961495168
Might just walk into her here.	70.39474191084835
The lane is safer.	423.1963682690693
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	299.3098041695596
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	40.21643781852609
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	20.942630038864962
_Voglio e non_.	183.1684056623006
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	40.90818666068522
Sociable.	3279.475308279624
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	36.460744362930896
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	33.44771075949042
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	30.557436315284754
No - one.	303.1392705001233
Meade ’ s timberyard.	106.94871078683059
Piled balks.	410.5471886343227
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	37.715365999979504
Not a sinner.	126.0843490085307
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	14.332904629145586
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	33.698849530545374
Pity to disturb them.	104.47107519743092
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	26.898613627813717
Open it.	300.0997692734887
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	27.09677398037278
She liked mignonette.	1031.8154209395382
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	168.57475440748277
And Mr?	1648.3166319658128
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	85.76219546386494
A flower.	2298.027198408115
I think it ’ s a.	111.57953565885825
Not annoyed then?	247.72137914040727
What does she say?	50.56867707156138
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	15.303302088164168
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	96.00165118769111
Why did you enclose the stamps?	333.2717789248968
I am awfully angry with you.	349.15463051769905
I do wish I could punish you for that.	47.5105948297203
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	14.293290623366097
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	19.120735324403135
I do wish I could do something for you.	47.5105948297203
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	27.847917371994026
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	50.11892792216469
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	32.267833433396795
I think of you so often you have no idea.	45.32061607036423
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	35.57366318187116
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	27.573605033213095
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	33.88291296826929
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	26.422204453489336
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	21.325420445601036
Then I will tell you all.	26.10488591105318
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	12.818882565562715
today.	3279.475308279624
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	31.123944767437496
S.	355.170570843061
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	29.34734028186636
I want to know.	140.88900955046097
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	20.569881678100245
They like it because no - one can hear.	52.326016185031364
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	25.166222678229488
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	29.078591176356415
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	12.989065023501466
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	11.099563986174338
Weak joy opened his lips.	66.47866443302057
Changed since the first letter.	99.69176780614801
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	59.56592510481382
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	15.933736614671203
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	39.03485820355217
Thank you: not having any.	53.22676874598067
Usual love scrimmage.	183.1684056623006
Then running round corners.	415.86026552057393
Bad as a row with Molly.	40.09832190611694
Cigar has a cooling effect.	72.82237374211775
Narcotic.	3279.475308279624
Go further next time.	101.94562658213312
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	25.12428137607434
Brutal, why not?	154.27744248794457
A bit at a time.	132.38156923351988
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	22.835668072001415
Common pin, eh?	154.27744248794457
He threw it on the road.	100.1861166586408
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	25.830685179696463
Queer the number of pins they always have.	26.012037795356505
No roses without thorns.	398.4028579034586
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	43.62316795256754
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	17.482576831233917
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	49.09451517311954
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	33.562603051209955
It?	3061.83031785061
Them.	1575.979671522145
Such a bad headache.	99.81244717303377
Has her roses probably.	112.79054408606683
Or sitting all day typing.	255.9275286209234
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	99.69176780614801
What perfume does your wife use.	88.97091480550286
Now could you make out a thing like that?	88.30672248851324
To keep it up.	218.41867453330855
Martha, Mary.	101.32019343396415
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	26.490145563189305
He is sitting in their house, talking.	171.51148477459668
Mysterious.	1575.979671522145
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	24.60422215864465
To keep it up.	218.41867453330855
Nice kind of evening feeling.	66.95446500098627
No more wandering about.	177.2326657964727
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	32.04324451338763
Forget.	1274.0642762518826
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	74.97686062314719
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	12.908259984924198
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	27.52080697126652
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	89.27230634589307
Tell her: more and more: all.	72.24985507936749
Then a sigh: silence.	158.4609393558481
Long long long rest.	156.35780583331203
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	14.334511812347687
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	24.576663712419766
Henry Flower.	200.54730474664692
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	17.280206240362478
Simple bit of paper.	154.27744248794457
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	19.138126212667117
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	27.86044346574022
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	15.871255950553495
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	72.82237374211775
A million pounds, wait a moment.	93.79034352900702
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	15.976563143056719
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	37.49957440760604
Yes, exactly.	3685.1437981541176
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	46.044729880055215
What am I saying barrels?	167.07437661148498
Gallons.	3279.475308279624
About a million barrels all the same.	34.77294419683107
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	43.595998123454876
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	26.898613627813717
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	13.566037861876241
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	49.981296044631684
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	15.976563143056719
Damn it.	182.0491504605432
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	32.71457752677828
Same notice on the door.	72.26718719734185
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	48.68606297837003

Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	22.835668072001415
The protestants are the same.	236.75172691695573
Convert Dr William J.	154.27744248794457
Walsh <URL>. to the true religion.	55.693150474036834
Save China ’ s millions.	59.95226050716612
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	31.6579243031297
Prefer an ounce of opium.	99.69176780614801
Celestials.	3279.475308279624
Rank heresy for them.	154.27744248794457
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	35.45171885100945
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	13.007614010042618
Not like Ecce Homo.	87.61895682633295
Crown of thorns and cross.	99.69176780614801
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	54.58606516877998
Chopsticks?	3279.475308279624
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	36.460744362930896
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	15.70280594261983
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	25.80595392648324
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	83.2233814680901
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	17.230796866652334
Still life.	620.2357047338855
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	36.460744362930896
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	62.670253252813914
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	30.531954223901174
Something going on: some sodality.	54.3715065252398
Pity so empty.	178.08821381048023
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	34.37841340931671
Who is my neighbour?	306.0258387899663
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	55.693150474036834
That woman at midnight mass.	96.01783395299685
Seventh heaven.	711.3009653190022
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	18.697877408613927
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	129.14506950814115
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	26.218699005951684
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	13.714053549440877
Her hat and head sank.	51.9110956202321
Then the next one.	162.49155592062536
Her hat sank at once.	51.9110956202321
Then the next one: a small old woman.	39.55311212504823
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	26.218699005951684
Latin.	3279.475308279624
The next one.	954.3116359862598
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	12.67204479233954
What?	2342.5114089148965
_Corpus: _ body.	106.94871078683059
Corpse.	1330.846217134227
Good idea the Latin.	65.49569493987148
Stupefies them first.	284.3169932778216
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	35.25347931803343
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	45.42570298685798
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	130.2764248783531
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	20.685230843397374
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	24.948715648731763
These pots we have to wear.	42.67973263587102
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	67.33844468465976
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	15.458510887291318
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	19.50162969225224
Look at them.	153.36882015109938
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	63.08345616644946
Lollipop.	3279.475308279624
It does.	389.9380789309915
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	123.2092169808763
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	15.074785589345288
Hokypoky penny a lump.	154.27744248794457
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	25.310229031689172
They do.	2836.4491262052948
I ’ m sure of that.	150.00418716270102
Not so lonely.	144.1974547495294
In our confraternity.	1024.9621948498984
Then come out a bit spreeish.	151.15088486026846
Let off steam.	1129.3487530586954
Thing is if you really believe in it.	34.65761793055778
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	22.835668072001415
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	51.48399123502332
Hence those snores.	165.49959036625415
Blind faith.	361.65629589290785
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	34.051744468951725
Lulls all pain.	284.3169932778216
Wake this time next year.	67.73263075336398
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	12.619014934823992
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	110.29686606448689
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	58.179038626344166
Bald spot behind.	290.9420807687356
Letters on his back: <URL>	72.82237374211775
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	35.57366318187116
And the other one?	163.72967976895566
Iron nails ran in.	98.27978219799586
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	54.58606516877998
Do not deny my request.	105.82912197438552
Dusk and the light behind her.	71.85002890012079
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	20.58097704990442
Their character.	384.55327630223553
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	12.88172671170847
This very church.	150.7776901441516
Peter Carey, yes.	19.19239048147498
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	68.44764406921124
Denis Carey.	292.1187024185887
And just imagine that.	248.2652247481676
Wife and six children at home.	46.66949256777235
And plotting that murder all the time.	103.30061877438706
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	19.903518198727898
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	52.326016185031364
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	33.55243387796857
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	20.665161745360624
Yes: under the bridge.	40.5566929062645
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	25.171175114306973
Wine.	831.2657542937562
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	11.123427523790241
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	11.13129060617422
Cold comfort.	211.0500139360508
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	14.694238905223433
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	35.79050665803874
Quite right.	142.53431157162612
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	57.527360933160175
Not going to be any music.	50.082062865499516
Pity.	423.13088219247254
Who has the organ here I wonder?	81.18165995849964
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	12.451459556909413
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	22.31306276507468
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	58.9883329188698
Christ or Pilate?	23.312818687034007
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	11.569127288958766
Music they wanted.	144.71065490547954
Footdrill stopped.	711.3009653190022
Could hear a pin drop.	46.11220456010912
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	41.91877903687843
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	15.970550127353247
Mercadante: seven last words.	99.69176780614801
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	38.44965616942778
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	17.915336330597306
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	52.06431999483772
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	29.75046079761603
Benedictine.	3279.475308279624
Green Chartreuse.	232.29930891778383
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	18.765803817268495
What kind of voice is it?	148.59060056533409
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	28.95749727601035
Connoisseurs.	3279.475308279624
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	112.61101000056522
Kind of a placid.	61.664953154471654
No worry.	2951.7761514224244
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	21.754014430405338
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	71.85002890012079
Who knows?	1396.4397969065874
One way out of it.	65.97168003446646
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	18.24632585139024
All crossed themselves and stood up.	68.99073724601803
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	19.081758634372058
Stand up at the gospel of course.	12.751686443704596
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	24.763223685123602
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	16.717212499702537
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	17.178614720207587
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	26.57461933305579
English.	3279.475308279624
Throw them the bone.	98.27978219799586
I remember slightly.	450.38190235688506
How long since your last mass?	54.5104026413015
Glorious and immaculate virgin.	98.27978219799586
Joseph, her spouse.	98.27978219799586
Peter and Paul.	23.312818687034007
More interesting if you understood what it was all about.	26.972224973583923
Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	33.24918719809889
Confession.	3279.475308279624
Everyone wants to.	107.5643624356902
Then I will tell you all.	26.10488591105318
Penance.	1575.979671522145
Punish me, please.	154.27744248794457
Great weapon in their hands.	52.59468761573086
More than doctor or solicitor.	68.88785875127277
Woman dying to.	178.08821381048023
And I schschschschschsch.	503.1980735963515
And did you chachachachacha?	389.72129441311597
And why did you?	270.1638640847611
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	67.73263075336398
Husband learn to his surprise.	67.73263075336398
God ’ s little joke.	64.93150782505761
Then out she comes.	288.2840067067471

Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.	71.85002890012079
How I found the Lord.	107.01329292553896
Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show.	24.649111540024546
And don ’ t they rake in the money too?	48.52594283958658
Bequests also: to the <URL>. for the time being in his absolute discretion.	22.305803569687797
Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.	27.539577804115986
Monasteries and convents.	284.3169932778216
No browbeating him.	887.6195005876992
He had his answer pat for everything.	76.74167870607978
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	33.33907412522226
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	23.754063448775508
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	9.601962209697222
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	42.26164577088772
All over.	655.8145920333396
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	153.14632269331
Brother Buzz.	711.3009653190022
Come around with the plate perhaps.	76.04950237896658
Pay your Easter duty.	106.94871078683059
He stood up.	480.9755190703705
Hello.	377.16781877608435
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	44.780159743091346
Women enjoy it.	149.95960714246385
Never tell you.	1332.0575895618188
But we.	2281.3060638312177
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	17.893724694322405
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	115.94950269827015
Glimpses of the moon.	154.27744248794457
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	124.74467655486438
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	101.68128277128709
Still like you better untidy.	92.18520383661858
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	34.28927065984544
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	19.107073443368176
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	15.209011252222929
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	19.537806783222546
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	52.462989811536055
He covered himself.	959.9408157110453
How goes the time?	167.57552936324973
Quarter past.	410.5471886343227
Time enough yet.	153.97989559566744
Better get that lotion made up.	42.08768316326092
Ah yes, the last time.	50.52458102126474
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	54.58606516877998
Chemists rarely move.	284.3169932778216
Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.	30.74442121206193
Hamilton Long ’ s, founded in the year of the flood.	30.57117484626166
Huguenot churchyard near there.	98.27978219799586
Visit some day.	284.3169932778216
He walked southward along Westland row.	119.13373150975515
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	53.93107285929044
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	55.456597972375306
Bore this funeral affair.	106.94871078683059
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	60.27719384647774
When was it I got it made up last?	58.83847389714203
Wait.	365.9458717894147
I changed a sovereign I remember.	147.46268464768747
First of the month it must have been or the second.	27.43615384862623
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	36.300004159334456
The chemist turned back page after page.	109.1343468108211
Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have.	55.693150474036834
Shrunken skull.	711.3009653190022
And old.	1648.3166319658128

Why?	3668.761700153618
Reaction.	3279.475308279624
A lifetime in a night.	194.84482612077056
Gradually changes your character.	154.27744248794457
Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.	26.417894824319646

Doctor Whack.	350.02061860370287
He ought to physic himself a bit.	99.52828314194088
Electuary or emulsion.	284.3169932778216
The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck.	14.605970038681654
Simples.	3279.475308279624
Want to be careful.	66.26685470960986

Remedy where you least expect it.	71.85002890012079
Clever of nature.	183.1684056623006
— About a fortnight ago, sir?	165.65170223267376
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	121.29003691081343
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	18.322564912064895
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	26.417894824319646
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	32.94364323193704
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	24.726818165350778
— And white wax also, he said.	237.83671849403132
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	40.637855059306744
Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs.	12.305310170578032
Skinfood.	3279.475308279624

had only one skin.	154.27744248794457
Leopold, yes.	165.72577861605842
Three we have.	192.7231491029608
Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse.	38.44965616942778
But you want a perfume too.	102.1472194185138
What perfume does your?	380.5031874825104
_Peau d ’ Espagne_.	154.27744248794457
That orangeflower water is so fresh.	69.52771849452989
Nice smell these soaps have.	66.95446500098627
Pure curd soap.	161.2259711689697

Dirt gets rolled up in your navel.	55.693150474036834
Nicer if a nice girl did it.	55.693150474036834
Also I think I.	152.97810186709606
Yes I.	3359.4571228515365
Do it in the bath.	72.45934164646849
Curious longing I.	112.34803027336187

Combine business with pleasure.	154.27744248794457
Pity no time for massage.	71.37392080945199
Feel fresh then all the day.	52.75843191756596
Funeral be rather glum.	98.27978219799586
That was two and nine.	272.329972917808
Have you brought a bottle?	276.9610970670809
— No, Mr Bloom said.	109.91348042409025
Make it up, please.	293.22091482913333
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	32.51685314208401
— Fourpence, sir.	791.3955546268766
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	37.539711398936696
Sweet lemony wax.	107.5643624356902
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	96.80529258082184
That makes three and a penny.	69.52771849452989
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	91.4868704415088
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	37.4233785946411
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	198.65782521464746
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	18.658693273043497
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	27.881545392496204
What ’ s the best news?	77.15389906191803
Is that today ’ s?	60.54052150879747
Show us a minute.	17.754538009916914
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	24.649111540024546
He does look balmy.	270.9144804323285
Younger than I am.	154.27744248794457
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	25.839494568645687
Wants a wash too.	27.870683628568717
Take off the rough dirt.	46.239242436696735
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	26.93609608862809
Dandruff on his shoulders.	154.27744248794457
Scalp wants oiling.	284.3169932778216
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	37.99819545936892
Where the bugger is it?	180.95470863008944
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	36.97843128844294
Barber ’ s itch.	154.27744248794457
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	27.940517896863163
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	28.13629768557821
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	77.36841310227878
— Ascot.	8263.997203702196
Gold cup.	148.41496625058616
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	69.59647048108864
Half a mo.	104.56366084011357
Maximum the second.	284.3169932778216
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	63.040283728898125
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	29.00139441609376
— What ’ s that?	163.73218576815398
his sharp voice said.	154.27744248794457
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	131.74112279704195
I was going to throw it away that moment.	131.61804066153547
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	16.934240150772336
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	151.52707554047782
Here, thanks.	151.05104463199095
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	83.46847464911093
God speed scut.	172.65180651650817
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	18.423993679879043
Silly lips of that chap.	53.58879228020047
Betting.	1575.979671522145
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	43.62316795256754

Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	26.417894824319646
Keeps a hotel now.	106.94871078683059
They never come back.	247.14125763138512
Fleshpots of Egypt.	284.3169932778216
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	55.54017228483801
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	23.516109400905076
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	19.07535402528653
Damn bad ad.	148.3417086374344
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	46.72769985719863
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	24.242079441118253
Something to catch the eye.	49.254816918172565
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	31.230821277129575
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	18.816747879675525
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	34.98287179407456
How do you do, sir?	59.71947935713762
Heavenly weather really.	284.3169932778216
If life was always like that.	73.13331893152713
Cricket weather.	711.3009653190022
Sit around under sunshades.	93.37079519235303
Over after over.	171.44234122609615
Out.	901.4866287931386
They can ’ t play it here.	73.32813119369028
Duck for six wickets.	154.27744248794457
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	19.914682833817533
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	71.85002890012079
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	30.948698554300694
Heatwave.	3279.475308279624
Won ’ t last.	66.57741592452264
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	16.032613822277174
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	19.05511760278557
This is my body.	145.96771906570635
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	16.84871159932568
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	10.900689845594824
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	23.307139997454097
— Come on, Simon.	575.3847293355782
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	104.51978223264024
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	37.85303254694255
— Are we all here now?	184.5152631397817
Martin Cunningham asked.	95.92606024832023
Come along, Bloom.	106.01242232239015
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	39.48266503860945
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	24.961713868701995
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	19.096766372448048
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	45.43280548811966
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	43.62316795256754
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	45.42570298685798
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	20.58840471560619
Job seems to suit them.	99.69176780614801
Huggermugger in corners.	284.3169932778216
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	35.45171885100945
Then getting it ready.	415.86026552057393
Laying it out.	284.3169932778216
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	32.24714468800341
Pull it more to your side.	50.40191784567241
Our windingsheet.	402.3366152059914
Never know who will touch you dead.	30.073913715974893
Wash and shampoo.	284.3169932778216
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	46.929276406850164
Keep a bit in an envelope.	39.91305334677303
Grows all the same after.	99.69176780614801
Unclean job.	711.3009653190022
All waited.	318.2975245720818
Nothing was said.	163.12693328666506
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	99.69176780614801
I am sitting on something hard.	349.15463051769905
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	76.28896364783878
Better shift it out of that.	60.412794699231966
Wait for an opportunity.	110.38999243337594
All waited.	318.2975245720818
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	26.061822944379713
A jolt.	2298.027198408115
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	30.74442121206193
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	38.800325990672775
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	25.885858397264805
At walking pace.	1082.4742194134117
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	23.94392793364219
Tritonville road.	711.3009653190022
Quicker.	1575.979671522145
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	26.206139885859656
— What way is he taking us?	170.33946433665645
Mr Power asked through both windows.	39.8682035747321
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	264.91026147013235
Ringsend.	1575.979671522145
Brunswick street.	711.3009653190022
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	180.77220556808936
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	42.47366265423948
I am glad to see it has not died out.	96.00165118769111
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	26.28161750016975
Respect.	1575.979671522145
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	27.820240314483865
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	19.349851340559788
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	47.62551239205619
— Who is that?	487.7310889728176
— Your son and heir.	269.9801690516173
— Where is he?	287.581533232176
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	105.76082750151015
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	12.890631634357971
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	41.82790148840043
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	55.74400655007094
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	15.67192496350725
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	57.527360933160175
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	45.42570298685798
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	36.8053615875355
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	31.03969229782612
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	104.06335192720522
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	16.040536741099192
Out on the rampage all night.	54.11077159570658
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	22.835668072001415
Wife ironing his back.	86.78485451543763
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	33.460695566409285
All breadcrumbs they are.	146.14620725100127
About six hundred per cent profit.	42.2957357935041
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	69.3198535251414
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	29.154983034126424
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	12.516547685712231
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	53.71025997935588
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	22.545664047578434
A counterjumper ’ s son.	194.84482612077056
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	20.580976268150902
Not likely.	598.7620097582651
He ceased.	3255.4081635959224
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	15.31971303973319
Noisy selfwilled man.	284.3169932778216
Full of his son.	63.233606586985594
He is right.	4053.086916226956
Something to hand on.	67.77300535469803
If little Rudy had lived.	101.7292790811762
See him grow up.	382.347539529791
Hear his voice in the house.	50.40191784567241
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	35.911108443560096
My son.	249.10374535726646
Me in his eyes.	106.30332172500808
Strange feeling it would be.	66.47866443302057
From me.	613.7375709238547
Just a chance.	101.25337573080182
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	12.411727965275109
And the sergeant grinning up.	162.35351629637253
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	36.05612442848597
Give us a touch, Poldy.	37.37660550945097
God, I ’ m dying for it.	41.159890366113665
How life begins.	313.97322994223293
Got big then.	209.61996185438593
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	43.221062517293106
My son inside her.	76.65144333615392
I could have helped him on in life.	48.85304356092975
I could.	1677.9757796226063
Make him independent.	1287.51626358048
Learn German too.	161.2259711689697
— Are we late?	542.553909370294
Mr Power asked.	110.79556327955336
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	59.400781123910356
Molly.	760.3207875494005
Milly.	496.6725611206224
Same thing watered down.	73.48032188788406
Her tomboy oaths.	177.00939881909616
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	30.1437852462827
Soon be a woman.	92.68823457328038
Mullingar.	922.757229076909
Dearest Papli.	410.5471886343227
Young student.	154.02362855723538
Yes, yes: a woman too.	195.5711404096687
Life, life.	104.56366084011357
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	34.208922669271594
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	42.24522347179102
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	40.89736889152998
Do you follow me?	87.18817797488856
He closed his left eye.	191.7464935082746
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	25.699205603713942
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	56.90449493469729
Crumbs?	1575.979671522145
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	29.888267353756063
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	18.402159625913804
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	14.830986444678084
What do you think, Martin?	83.30063470302801
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	102.12515741594994
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	74.51757195404784
Glad I took that bath.	50.32178194932059
Feel my feet quite clean.	51.16436759240765
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	36.90446209972905
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	365.9725397559854
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	49.506080519827954
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	247.21368523831202
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	21.793099419953922
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	263.4242372449319
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	121.2023679421311
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	1061.1325836504916
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	103.55307459174308
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	76.57666568350187
He said he ’ d try to come.	56.13889522097008
The carriage halted short.	208.7860358480693
— What ’ s wrong?	460.8045207278703
— We ’ re stopped.	231.16402524455546
— Where are we?	537.2921324965961
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	33.9189338458286
— The grand canal, he said.	120.92166578202324
Whooping cough they say it cures.	71.85002890012079
Good job Milly never got it.	41.34056758711302
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	27.568175771788173
Shame really.	361.65629589290785
Only measles.	410.83674093262044
Flaxseed tea.	711.3009653190022
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	154.27744248794457
Canvassing for death.	284.3169932778216
Don ’ t miss this chance.	53.87443688548535
Dogs ’ home over there.	61.12338231827737
Thy will be done.	106.94871078683059
We obey them in the grave.	155.2607038601092
A dying scrawl.	726.5144068847064
He took it to heart, pined away.	70.67220884586723
Quiet brute.	410.5471886343227
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	41.41244827277817
A raindrop spat on his hat.	129.14506950814115
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	22.940211788159246
Apart.	3279.475308279624
Curious.	697.8179021829318
Like through a colander.	155.81942904373335
I thought it would.	250.80498802563065
My boots were creaking I remember now.	44.60309288422465
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	72.50637442941812
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	38.8415455434275
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	94.07938777161206
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	45.62321041022387
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	13.618059159796571
— We ’ re off again.	149.97893978441925
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	30.622719867660745
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	75.78740752751007
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	63.73992859982203
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	63.20928061684733
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	18.7061149008529
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	373.7198517201464
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	14.449506293394535
And the retrospective arrangement.	272.5243000950026
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	65.9563779618384
Martin Cunningham asked.	95.92606024832023
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	147.79007061253446
Where is it?	726.4788757142585
— In the paper this morning.	129.6955906903985
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	42.05066058671374
That book I must change for her.	42.367581501584034
Later on please.	284.3169932778216
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	12.499336455584892
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	25.121786637262968
no, Sexton, Urbright.	99.69176780614801
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	38.44965616942778
Thanks to the Little Flower.	78.48575528102963
Sadly missed.	361.65629589290785
To the inexpressible grief of his.	33.01988418144098
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	45.42570298685798
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	78.35301210780398
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	114.78519246449429
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	11.470337771409275
I tore up the envelope?	226.73698664214498
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	17.409401837265797
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	425.27559828986125
There all right.	190.15429441183082
Dear Henry fled.	106.44989922352573
Before my patience are exhausted.	61.54002214511295
National school.	711.3009653190022
Meade ’ s yard.	106.94871078683059
The hazard.	3231.5631710819375
Only two there now.	106.9989910094048
Nodding.	3279.475308279624
Full as a tick.	99.262726120774
Too much bone in their skulls.	116.58678773525128
The other trotting round with a fare.	66.36804391934469
An hour ago I was passing there.	118.03962143118123
The jarvies raised their hats.	236.75172691695573
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	25.553509599248017
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	17.404844230694888
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	30.548194876317638
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	20.822659820346907
Antient concert rooms.	284.3169932778216
Nothing on there.	163.12693328666506
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	34.59120830839159
Not much grief there.	87.61895682633295
Quarter mourning.	410.5471886343227
People in law perhaps.	73.16422510501177
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	17.665772977564973
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	45.42570298685798
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	25.63241811363943
I said I.	578.7071761221847
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	127.81811959164207
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	154.27744248794457
Big powerful change.	185.51975432200754
Wet bright bills for next week.	54.58606516877998
_Fun on the Bristol_.	154.27744248794457
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	32.34145497072847
Have to stand a drink or two.	40.24453022791047
As broad as it ’ s long.	64.89832728305322
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	226.58156561836006
Her songs.	393.3646098247185
Plasto ’ s.	284.3169932778216
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	35.06175264076556
Who was he?	112.83608773254866
— How do you do?	199.26136039346295
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	29.28382499950264
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	69.44546440117122
Yes, he does.	831.1393989219825
How do you do?	63.49033723560511
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
Mr Dedalus asked.	328.9771675937839
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	166.24929520258826
There he is airing his quiff.	48.35070486939877
Just that moment I was thinking.	67.3293586459105
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	180.77220556808936
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	15.385616955336209
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	21.235444808430273
The nails, yes.	423.1963682690693
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	28.973499736818507
Fascination.	3279.475308279624
Worst man in Dublin.	98.27978219799586
That keeps him alive.	147.66485365101107
They sometimes feel what a person is.	102.98860223816708
Instinct.	1250.8558942273744
But a type like that.	36.752415454934166
My nails.	431.58920446298544
I am just looking at them: well pared.	121.40351666428978
And after: thinking alone.	149.88443970798826
Body getting a bit softy.	67.73263075336398
I would notice that: from remembering.	77.00003899098547
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	22.786361710309276
But the shape is there.	127.39174935404401
The shape is there still.	236.75172691695573
Shoulders.	3279.475308279624
Hips.	3279.475308279624
Plump.	3279.475308279624
Night of the dance dressing.	62.017276892357266
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	71.85002890012079
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	24.612826292208606
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	17.763476117791257
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	79.66219700390612
I hear great accounts of it.	84.2712422778172
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	42.57000119607846
— Are you going yourself?	199.9306546354746
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	173.07525932646288
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	27.695503981470704
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	21.05579411402476
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	33.27085028842501
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	129.6101681456556
Mary Anderson is up there now.	50.40191784567241
Have you good artists?	508.18497035088086
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	78.80902601266011
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	22.374727341522462
J.	244.1848863975607
C.	417.9052384715969
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	43.62316795256754
The best, in fact.	157.8760107680608
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	459.3324843351563
Last but not least.	97.18563025060972
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	23.255709614194963
Smith O ’ Brien.	173.1705741029498
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	29.945905611378315
Woman.	423.13088219247254
Must be his deathday.	115.53712384190031
For many happy returns.	147.7161336946852
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	18.15729194879218
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	186.05878092647762
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	39.098348390427105
Had his office in Hume street.	56.89061084288531
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	19.837504251062764
Has that silk hat ever since.	56.80736470133303
Relics of old decency.	154.27744248794457
Mourning too.	410.5471886343227
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	21.3671860268483
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	102.49264813080799
Twenty past eleven.	162.96237111491672
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	36.007401545491895
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	24.8725388811334
No: _vorrei e non_.	149.9140365748929
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	19.66051485332327
_Mi trema un poco il_.	99.69176780614801
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	27.86044346574022
A thrush.	1115.340185378849
A throstle.	1115.340185378849
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	27.999048621639
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	39.112440177346386
Greyish over the ears.	154.27744248794457
_Madame_: smiling.	284.3169932778216
I smiled back.	578.7071761221847
A smile goes a long way.	129.14506950814115
Only politeness perhaps.	183.27174694877095
Nice fellow.	354.41641650291933
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	53.31593232807371
Not pleasant for the wife.	90.34766227537672
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	17.03046558265407
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	47.13082572031467
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	34.66925981909888
What is this she was?	172.89953838697014
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	99.69176780614801
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	49.13051402791068
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	75.96145962128111
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	60.712269189594565
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	15.154126303102343
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	63.005214640188086
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	13.022035922575569
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	111.68996545663556
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	80.80738839928925
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	37.35822103831161
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	25.1330311339377
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	39.39967026429829
— Yes.	1687.0603916768166
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	53.44513944936161
— What is that?	659.3813389445104
Mr Dedalus asked.	328.9771675937839
I didn ’ t hear it.	118.23763284495874
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	16.79111348240848
— What?	1708.7588479661683
Mr Dedalus asked.	328.9771675937839
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	69.52771849452989
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	20.995763126061323
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	165.65170223267376
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	22.97401550256192
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	39.789760042797184
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	10.590478686988243
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	43.99049779727045
Is he dead?	156.6042939447239
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	186.05878092647762
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	12.017767034877345
Half the town was there.	48.79303599868082
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	121.29003691081343
But the funny part is.....	73.0932544639008
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	39.35323281064701
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	51.5348929245577
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	81.30105793071256
Like a hero.	108.85576164198928
A silver florin.	726.5144068847064
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	122.64139243841075
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	103.17469252257564
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	57.13404543336979
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	23.7068164071508
Nelson ’ s pillar.	155.4023304798192
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	23.592672943242505
Mr Dedalus sighed.	801.6376397364049
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	43.13190966017806
Many a good one he told himself.	29.372578588420435
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	29.14834212323385
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	12.623783119075071
He ’ s gone from us.	223.24439576637587
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	30.027704256557758
He went very suddenly.	292.99584604319966
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	264.91026147013235
Heart.	458.1677672992498
He tapped his chest sadly.	173.66933671006979
Blazing face: redhot.	154.27744248794457
Too much John Barleycorn.	294.1703857395412
Cure for a red nose.	99.69176780614801
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	29.033504779318996
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	58.2835823287953
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	28.309817276645838
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	53.59983228819115
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	95.65517032532475
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	42.37327781679854
— No suffering, he said.	241.4413576815686
A moment and all is over.	129.14506950814115
Like dying in sleep.	155.81942904373335
No - one spoke.	263.5120380990524
Dead side of the street this.	41.73878332904941
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	11.656214494674252
Why?	3668.761700153618
Some reason.	322.2260251749698
Sun or wind.	183.1684056623006
At night too.	697.3732897729142
Chummies and slaveys.	284.3169932778216
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	27.680447687920896
Foundation stone for Parnell.	154.27744248794457
Breakdown.	3279.475308279624
Heart.	458.1677672992498
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	18.087927906147897
A tiny coffin flashed by.	142.32933231834676
In a hurry to bury.	157.76100288146947
A mourning coach.	726.5144068847064
Unmarried.	3279.475308279624
Black for the married.	73.16422510501177
Piebald for bachelors.	284.3169932778216
Dun for a nun.	154.27744248794457
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	188.89484115673005
A child.	1168.416809422869
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	30.519793733221626
Dwarf ’ s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	22.835668072001415
Burial friendly society pays.	154.27744248794457
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	13.007614010042618
Our.	585.1342134097123
Little.	1389.5892398413582
Beggar.	1274.0642762518826
Baby.	3279.475308279624
Meant nothing.	711.3009653190022
Mistake of nature.	165.49959036625415
If it ’ s healthy it ’ s from the mother.	26.787856258131967
If not from the man.	69.11695768310265
Better luck next time.	109.07705510675777
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	103.60240203154753
It ’ s well out of it.	55.732198813363425
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	38.92700334338897
Rattle his bones.	159.45735872736876
Over the stones.	96.15233542947732
Only a pauper.	103.92683549792656
Nobody owns.	24.990771238543836
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	55.3824002928935
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	32.15108728950103
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	26.42328503665088
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	39.24846454891777
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	156.5441287537373
We must take a charitable view of it.	64.19576706024748
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	30.20685545557108
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	41.595677558614014
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	22.340413049830083
Looking away now.	194.95299911299122
Sympathetic human man he is.	72.82237374211775
Intelligent.	3279.475308279624
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	103.96935486350809
Always a good word to say.	44.66017441022927
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	19.03306492937261
Refuse christian burial.	284.3169932778216
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	27.249264204013205
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	48.23574094181707
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	54.58606516877998
He looked at me.	236.88840590494053
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	41.79476289486131
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	18.15729194879218
Leading him the life of the damned.	55.693150474036834
Monday morning.	410.5471886343227
Start afresh.	711.3009653190022
Shoulder to the wheel.	154.27744248794457
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	16.15539699411233
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	29.75046079761603
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	28.38796607759611
He looked away from me.	171.5347896092399
He knows.	1399.5150151944995
Rattle his bones.	159.45735872736876
That afternoon of the inquest.	96.01783395299685
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	153.14632269331
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	83.2233814680901
Stuffy it was.	284.3169932778216
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	45.42570298685798
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	55.42059883550668
Boots giving evidence.	284.3169932778216
Thought he was asleep first.	59.95226050716612
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	82.53639523109993
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	32.90306305773515
Verdict: overdose.	284.3169932778216
Death by misadventure.	23.312818687034007
The letter.	1865.1868048385204
For my son Leopold.	94.10001366711866
No more pain.	335.809071999107
Wake no more.	165.49959036625415
Nobody owns.	24.990771238543836
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	68.13984339742856
Over the stones.	96.15233542947732
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	44.90712650291566
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	199.6746381327796
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	28.432695618192746
The Gordon Bennett.	954.3116359862598
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	103.47472191028567
That will be worth seeing, faith.	38.51232263742535
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	13.559160458795722
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	55.675985358236176
Kay ee double ell wy.	72.82237374211775
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	20.80245769457211
He left me on my ownio.	116.77713455008784
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	99.69176780614801
Eccles street.	711.3009653190022
My house down there.	110.57252166865392
Big place.	417.14551309158657
Ward for incurables there.	98.27978219799586
Deadhouse handy underneath.	284.3169932778216
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	271.36066811865044
They look terrible the women.	219.74994916766755
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	27.46621144422366
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	44.30518527263652
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	18.840515747714882
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	42.034405115135556
From one extreme to the other.	66.74082997932044
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	54.46795470373094
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	16.058485666169727
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	12.69690401411406
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	245.89784767346688
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	36.03479770125007
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	33.465566659658876
Tomorrow is killing day.	106.94871078683059
Springers.	3279.475308279624
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	55.693150474036834
For Liverpool probably.	269.8692605656363
Roastbeef for old England.	154.27744248794457
They buy up all the juicy ones.	80.66861103018667
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	19.634397801750946
Comes to a big thing in a year.	45.42570298685798
Dead meat trade.	119.22940011600747
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	33.46196676388118
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	20.15198300855734
The carriage moved on through the drove.	68.13984339742856
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	25.766006347570247
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	20.380987523311816
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	66.40714747823742
Quite right.	142.53431157162612
They ought to.	500.46556818557207
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	9.716258679602795
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	53.03218530930979
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	36.719011840528516
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	99.69176780614801
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	56.06410186476232
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	37.80502023774891
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	22.648068276388294
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	94.07279829650132
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	24.58928461129244
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	24.794399989402603
Gordon Bennett cup.	183.1684056623006
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	75.78740752751007
Bom! Upset.	284.3169932778216
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	72.61433484527782
Burst open.	410.5471886343227
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	24.873699418488687
Red face: grey now.	60.88283630462218
Mouth fallen open.	31.069451104000514
Asking what ’ s up now.	54.58606516877998
Quite right to close it.	68.5089212979863
Looks horrid open.	146.2842507468076
Then the insides decompose quickly.	161.30061712985682
Much better to close up all the orifices.	36.460744362930896
Yes, also.	3685.1437981541176
With wax.	3505.4385636417223
The sphincter loose.	954.3116359862598
Seal up all.	183.1684056623006
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	49.64853140797185
Dunphy ’ s corner.	154.27744248794457
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	36.460744362930896
A pause by the wayside.	194.84482612077056
Tiptop position for a pub.	72.82237374211775
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	18.20586047275436
Pass round the consolation.	98.27978219799586
But suppose now it did happen.	108.83286833996881
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	21.124043920052564
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	37.732876626468105
Depends on where.	183.1684056623006
The circulation stops.	954.3116359862598
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	43.00342072514265
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	20.705767251312643
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	113.55165512604025
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	38.68449067765143
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	71.85002890012079
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	51.232820204380715
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	30.816270319032302
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	58.21457772142651
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	45.42570298685798
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	14.234620800000078
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	18.15729194879218
Or cycle down.	1064.249869459199
Hire some old crock, safety.	54.58606516877998
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	22.010340850766212
Developing waterways.	711.3009653190022
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	21.94644122419276
Cheaper transit.	711.3009653190022
By easy stages.	246.8731994609127
Houseboats.	3279.475308279624
Camping out.	711.3009653190022
Also hearses.	702.3339364170367
To heaven by water.	439.81893424216906
Perhaps I will without writing.	49.01724817248017
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	47.5375943691749
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	55.693150474036834
With turf from the midland bogs.	159.50394472206415
Salute.	3279.475308279624
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	37.054942406125775
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	80.66861103018667
Near it now.	149.54808811544035
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	55.5047275744993
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	75.25033921970473
— How is that?	430.4771341171254
Martin Cunningham said.	85.28482007171361
Left him weeping, I suppose?	54.58606516877998
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	62.68761662740991
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	68.13984339742856
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	83.2233814680901
Last lap.	205.26387315773908
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	14.694238905223433
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	99.69176780614801
In white silence: appealing.	249.14295083831692
The best obtainable.	541.1559067782772
Thos.	3279.475308279624
H.	368.781480841293
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	71.85002890012079
Passed.	3279.475308279624
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	14.836553799413013
After life ’ s journey.	77.99938281026297
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	26.898613627813717
Mr Power pointed.	190.33921081286488
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	61.2226381146066
The last house.	361.040406014415
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	36.70609681624325
A gruesome case.	726.5144068847064
Seymour Bushe got him off.	99.69176780614801
Murdered his brother.	284.3169932778216
Or so they said.	321.27446591351884
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	60.01380286282108
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	129.7511806500045
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	31.260143177153807
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	16.596868545461245
They looked.	1637.1357150423871
Murderer ’ s ground.	82.57582936802655
It passed darkly.	175.77480202149613
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	71.85002890012079
Whole place gone to hell.	67.73263075336398
Wrongfully condemned.	711.3009653190022
Murder.	1575.979671522145
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	51.57743221628618
They love reading about it.	219.74994916766755
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	34.20721749289948
Her clothing consisted of.	103.94342474692783
Recent outrage.	711.3009653190022
Murderer is still at large.	88.18344478206103
Clues.	3279.475308279624
A shoelace.	2298.027198408115
The body to be exhumed.	172.94128814290227
Murder will out.	183.1684056623006
Cramped in this carriage.	154.27744248794457
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	35.675112010142456
Must be careful about women.	77.80697734499188
Catch them once with their pants down.	41.232812167689204
Never forgive you after.	558.7736489371894
Fifteen.	381.840419993744
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	54.5928428376987
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	15.050361354927675
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	14.687577974241764
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	83.2233814680901
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	15.811140821293563
He stepped out.	520.8480867369477
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	55.912041687595156
Change that soap now.	98.27978219799586
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	17.143037899462676
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	25.506833560037787
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	55.693150474036834
It ’ s all the same.	53.36299635775338
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	29.75046079761603
Pomp of death.	284.3169932778216
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	19.28299016057313
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	26.898613627813717
Dogbiscuits.	3279.475308279624
Who ate them?	665.2195502894225
Mourners coming out.	183.1684056623006
He followed his companions.	294.81093433184697
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	21.812083036991424
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	20.841928685078578
He handed one to the boy.	116.77713455008784
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	48.226636065559354
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	16.520477343493596
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	109.1343468108211
Coffin now.	711.3009653190022
Got here before us, dead as he is.	33.47527834693745
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	31.484440655360793
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	18.20586047275436
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	26.10247050067179
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	38.19030525922692
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	151.15088486026846
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	50.70067980041338
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	55.693150474036834
Too many in the world.	205.12596615967476
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	25.121786637262968
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	29.698477238832638
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	12.146599491563293
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	35.42824120801875
So much dead weight.	313.26542758634463
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	34.65761793055778
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	27.96984240648392
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	28.71884461486575
Who is that beside them?	179.31693080829947
Ah, the brother - in - law.	78.92030251885693
All walked after.	266.4311256987857
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	18.265235660080602
— What?	1708.7588479661683
Mr Power whispered.	190.33921081286488
How so?	805.2220367841305
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	76.81011964228925
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	34.39574768951368
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	96.15786707320287
Anniversary.	3279.475308279624
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	162.0736799745545
First I heard of it.	48.888366271725836
Poisoned himself?	711.3009653190022
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	20.96920469867705
Speaking.	1330.846217134227
— Was he insured?	431.33340531398346
Mr Bloom asked.	81.84529962123028
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	187.5167831639268
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	89.04277798005567
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	40.42895108297041
— How many children did he leave?	110.38249947700346
— Five.	8263.997203702196
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	143.42569174586163
Five young children.	163.2910445837477
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	41.864339582146634
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	140.13902629381235
Has the laugh at him now.	40.50661560726506
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	39.847884272865954
She had outlived him.	305.6448674161551
Lost her husband.	165.49959036625415
More dead for her than for me.	41.77875871145777
One must outlive the other.	90.31336208659901
Wise men say.	165.49959036625415
There are more women than men in the world.	32.02468589617391
Condole with her.	284.3169932778216
Your terrible loss.	195.04990777657156
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	45.66072765978644
For Hindu widows only.	147.7161336946852
She would marry another.	208.33902723375363
Him?	1330.846217134227
No. Yet who knows after.	109.25981073985034
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	38.44965616942778
Drawn on a guncarriage.	154.27744248794457
Victoria and Albert.	284.3169932778216
Frogmore memorial mourning.	284.3169932778216
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	32.073125227893314
Vain in her heart of hearts.	54.58606516877998
All for a shadow.	91.09216743801824
Consort not even a king.	99.69176780614801
Her son was the substance.	71.06482012604096
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	17.314635464290205
It never comes.	148.03877587541706
— How are you, Simon?	155.11817619319345
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	35.27922209293188
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	25.93657067345649
— Never better.	1019.7167236784964
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	27.591920604948278
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	39.91158008303823
Same old six and eightpence.	52.789395064292
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	19.19239048147498
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	141.8115687768308
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	63.10061801610324
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	38.532569252782444
Dick Tivy bald?	183.1684056623006
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	36.165144942788075
A few bob a skull.	117.17504896473037
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	24.136975475824975
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	225.41810296568246
Is that the eldest boy in front?	37.785476177683336
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	67.63090909226408
John Henry Menton is behind.	54.58771286241622
He put down his name for a quid.	62.30865021166241
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	98.87604091296438
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	37.23007266777893
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	39.969811067891634
— How did he lose it?	155.11817619319345
Ned Lambert asked.	83.74905733738183
Liquor, what?	284.3169932778216
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	51.476801420108224
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	66.73072732955109
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	11.995577745748287
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	32.99323145259342
Both unconscious.	256.6155608463661
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	26.898613627813717
All he might have done.	95.17079221139628
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	80.74317228624768
Would he understand?	178.94937787780435
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	66.79888779276757
Which end is his head?	56.17365198595986
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	17.179092646666657
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	22.727904635634783
Always in front of us.	57.89643620627889
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	14.334866340041174
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	25.541378998438553
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	11.496729377375061
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	20.914205901199278
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	24.71746189582843
Who ’ ll read the book?	175.02871655757758
I, said the rook.	37.989142505948
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	19.762911298899315
Father Coffey.	680.7155268248586
I knew his name was like a coffin.	61.603141648849366
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	54.77716558877715
Bosses the show.	284.3169932778216
Muscular christian.	711.3009653190022
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	33.46196676388118
Thou art Peter.	143.3409013821524
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	25.121786637262968
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	51.28037537378435
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	50.712366333101926
Hhhn: burst sideways.	154.27744248794457
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	13.346762305737938
Requiem mass.	711.3009653190022
Crape weepers.	711.3009653190022
Blackedged notepaper.	711.3009653190022
Your name on the altarlist.	55.637412620979475
Chilly place this.	284.3169932778216
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	14.121603810728761
Eyes of a toad too.	60.88283630462218
What swells him up that way?	148.59060056533409
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	80.53741591133301
Air of the place maybe.	99.69176780614801
Looks full up of bad gas.	47.42951332326279
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	26.033543862569303
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	27.86044346574022
Who was telling me?	44.11045689591398
Mervyn Browne.	711.3009653190022
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	10.759274401139367
Out it rushes: blue.	98.70034128985165
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	36.12182738739913
My kneecap is hurting me.	74.93230833215537
Ow. That ’ s better.	50.40191784567243
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	17.99092425413416
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	38.721019182788545
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	48.770183056971796
As you were before you rested.	71.7637509286302
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	22.693887762280173
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	16.351881684759704
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	39.26901767491978
Up to fifteen or so.	48.60052711950374
After that, of course...	75.48723826868047
Holy water that was, I expect.	43.62316795256754
Shaking sleep out of it.	99.69176780614801
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	23.22235187389519
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	33.58317319445175
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	10.820831134370772
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	13.828559644454334
On Dignam now.	1045.0911334067425
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	22.01897041371021
Says that over everybody.	133.70618190237417
Tiresome kind of a job.	72.82237374211775
But he has to say something.	101.23813099513588
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	31.11615241021278
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	12.71077467686093
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	16.805726819148077
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	27.615584062848
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	25.691717454402642
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	27.97446513713741
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	17.34497431451871
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	62.2075188874349
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	28.556825811641495
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	74.86040175045336
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	18.69057194910472
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	42.30940282638043
But his heart is buried in Rome.	80.55600123559344
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	14.146284714452516
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	80.15093744102754
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	119.83773622885904
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	19.76311134424449
Mr Power took his arm.	74.84753007021948
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	40.8925532616781
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	112.4394640483809
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	32.401076967885835
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	18.68486406847837
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	92.43861185645186
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	30.425401026887634
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	44.27732732386227
I suppose we can do so too.	63.00009454081321
We are the last.	160.2181592543843
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	67.78592843876655
They covered their heads.	387.956915531319
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	39.44018476308118
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	34.285142784722694
Mason, I think: not sure.	55.693150474036834
Beside him again.	22.417636644123522
We are the last.	160.2181592543843
In the same boat.	303.51132046676577
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	34.508657869762715
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	12.861948082352235
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	103.93282310345633
The language of course was another thing.	109.1343468108211
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	17.745634047205332
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	55.1201934392286
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	180.56852355388205
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	14.319789454213714
No touching that.	887.6195005876992
Seat of the affections.	154.27744248794457
Broken heart.	410.5471886343227
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	33.698849530545374
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	25.60213911701197
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	21.622033958633562
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	34.79347975147076
The resurrection and the life.	236.75172691695573
Once you are dead you are dead.	38.67136704386034
That last day idea.	147.66485365101107
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	45.42570298685798
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	25.407287334771272
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	13.552464258756933
Find damn all of himself that morning.	41.232812167689204
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	71.85002890012079
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	98.27978219799586
Troy measure.	711.3009653190022
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	32.95365651538023
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	121.15919031487381
What?	2342.5114089148965
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	66.41813839801259
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	104.03902563330398
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	446.7813870930605
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	61.507094642958464
— What?	1708.7588479661683
Corny Kelleher said.	149.62588253969713
Mr Kernan assured him.	78.74867033305495
John Henry Menton asked.	76.40890315919785
I know his face.	185.80305435930094
Ned Lambert glanced back.	112.20317066756863
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	38.58782934849675
She ’ s his wife.	167.01974053667598
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	67.47072171065668
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	57.36359574016541
She was a finelooking woman.	121.51721508014275
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	22.498550071299967
And a good armful she was.	78.4208815208439
He looked behind through the others.	115.5202844074084
— What is he?	587.4419896313246
he asked.	136.3611024919681
What does he do?	50.56867707156138
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	48.68606297837003
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	36.16907240031251
Ned Lambert smiled.	194.01980160442912
A traveller for blottingpaper.	337.1606960464125
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	25.11659322762201
She had plenty of game in her then.	68.46213882949709
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	166.09908502842063
He does some canvassing for ads.	109.60346601075855
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	28.96123302853233
The barrow turned into a side lane.	85.48243185742561
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	30.61534538700688
The gravediggers touched their caps.	157.8760107680608
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	147.22297764585332
He never forgets a friend.	161.53114011664627
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	63.955647856087296
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	39.447162073157436
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	37.75361336647394
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	207.3255819475817
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	15.539683183738896
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	27.959138908746855
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	199.6746381327796
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	39.936006996817696
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	17.820062661824302
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	20.471434358446306
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	33.69833912672515
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	23.792815189540146
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	22.635170629569128
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	19.64815750597467
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	38.1066902352647
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	18.56822922455847
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	29.870366078208875
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	13.66016889117477
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	71.54005059801086
— I know, Hynes said.	399.6888818058717
I know that.	355.3884583586811
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	59.36101813874924
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	33.4795612042128
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	39.48266503860945
All want to be on good terms with him.	37.3307023941514
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	26.826559013162242
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	24.902472613094684
No passout checks.	887.6195005876992
_Habeas corpus_.	711.3009653190022
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	50.343252873718974
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	15.841360356703207
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	25.7753456709651
Be the better of a shave.	55.31259444750414
Grey sprouting beard.	165.49959036625415
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	20.59651235229616
And temper getting cross.	389.72129441311597
Silver threads among the grey.	72.82237374211775
Fancy being his wife.	98.27978219799586
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	35.467360126567236
Come out and live in the graveyard.	42.74242504676128
Dangle that before her.	154.27744248794457
It might thrill her first.	96.80056808317529
Courting death.	711.3009653190022
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	29.75046079761603
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	12.257301861931149
Will o ’ the wisp.	79.46979860981347
Gas of graves.	183.1684056623006
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	20.943535003608016
Women especially are so touchy.	63.126302450880715
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	42.512913450136196
Have you ever seen a ghost?	175.6776391344952
Well, I have.	69.50775779820746
It was a pitchdark night.	49.247911887295764
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	66.79888779276757
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	23.163285357681623
Learn anything if taken young.	66.47866443302057
You might pick up a young widow here.	80.49143128466481
Men like that.	23.312818687034007
Love among the tombstones.	119.06755845332485
Romeo.	3279.475308279624
Spice of pleasure.	284.3169932778216
In the midst of death we are in life.	59.23152232643947
Both ends meet.	125.77273053223315
Tantalising for the poor dead.	99.69176780614801
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	38.06811779753282
Gnawing their vitals.	284.3169932778216
Desire to grig people.	106.94871078683059
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	39.1235749993173
Eight children he has anyway.	99.69176780614801
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	22.62600362947846
Holy fields.	410.5471886343227
More room if they buried them standing.	41.77875871145777
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	16.728925825496166
Standing?	1575.979671522145
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	13.719070888306355
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	40.0137449074552
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	104.06335192720522
Well, so it is.	55.13656583521196
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	38.7243336700279
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	21.288767513393463
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	109.1343468108211
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	18.278840582627748
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	27.736343787908044
Every man his price.	79.71888887361885
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	24.109430672715536
A bargain.	2298.027198408115
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	17.52745490993853
With thanks.	3505.4385636417223
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	24.492828004103323
Charnelhouses.	3279.475308279624
Dreadful.	1330.846217134227
Turning green and pink decomposing.	16.703074473839205
Rot quick in damp earth.	99.69176780614801
The lean old ones tougher.	236.75172691695573
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	50.90972793920859
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	41.142628835672966
Then dried up.	934.4946353746477
Deathmoths.	3279.475308279624
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	20.14324398129536
Changing about.	410.5471886343227
Live for ever practically.	96.16032387952906
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	32.038659903539894
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	38.57539703828498
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	55.693150474036834
Your head it simply swurls.	46.1825577538151
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	74.11258974435084
He looks cheerful enough over it.	116.77713455008784
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	21.288767513393463
Wonder how he looks at life.	55.00006007488164
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	25.121786637262968
The one about the bulletin.	172.94128814290227
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	38.44965616942778
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	125.97537440557151
Not arrived yet.	247.72137914040727
Peter.	50.75252407334186
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	18.641050800246244
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	33.698849530545374
Keep out the damp.	110.59224734735528
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	21.05579411402476
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	183.1684056623006
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	36.460744362930896
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	26.898613627813717
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	99.69176780614801
Go out of mourning first.	69.89245556622114
Hard to imagine his funeral.	44.95346598190472
Seems a sort of a joke.	75.03294211661039
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	26.840669675330965
Gives you second wind.	106.94871078683059
New lease of life.	68.63154182248914
— How many have you for tomorrow?	119.2196935634125
the caretaker asked.	208.5969805178082
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	119.23483456744476
Half ten and eleven.	96.69654188981458
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	62.670253252813914
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	116.34866789708383
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	13.15136765906119
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	21.32705912598983
Burying him.	410.5471886343227
We come to bury Cæsar.	240.49100882463858
His ides of March or June.	145.16435036620675
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	48.387796641302536
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	44.85706538405251
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	56.488170764788464
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	38.802027288924236
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	31.052490033661886
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	39.48204109920474
Yes, he could.	831.1393989219825
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	15.221752951059344
We all do.	975.4795816140708
Only man buries.	183.27174694877095
No, ants too.	305.53702346771644
First thing strikes anybody.	107.79026572423427
Bury the dead.	183.1684056623006
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	42.928464039447086
Well then Friday buried him.	95.07299897363524
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	21.298202708876843
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	36.2928527097899
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	19.172202033017083
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	28.199263969265807
All gnawed through.	266.4311256987857
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	21.651870596532543
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	22.934644513976085
They ’ re so particular.	146.5385101636225
Lay me in my native earth.	50.40191784567241
Bit of clay from the holy land.	12.751686443704596
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	18.777235004991034
I see what it means.	122.53387357279001
I see.	683.1255774428936
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	50.890497010151776
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	89.19661172003369
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	45.42570298685798
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	17.82200851031357
Twelve.	1330.846217134227
I ’ m thirteen.	417.85240075671015
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	40.29907588156955
Death ’ s number.	19.19239048147498
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	68.9507621036448
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	38.72729375951266
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	53.58879228020047
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	29.84544592885151
Tinge of purple.	284.3169932778216
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	34.74246199195643
Dressy fellow he was once.	99.69176780614801
Used to change three suits in the day.	36.460744362930896
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	21.46076792629412
Hello.	377.16781877608435
It ’ s dyed.	154.43972457396384
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	19.617546280195775
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	25.73998539005988
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	63.582365156476826
Twenty.	1297.015683529286
Pause.	3279.475308279624
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	56.5764720060686
Far away a donkey brayed.	199.60525641467234
Rain.	939.5186216197353
No such ass.	887.6195005876992
Never see a dead one, they say.	32.50327559878396
Shame of death.	165.49959036625415
They hide.	2836.4491262052948
Also poor papa went away.	98.97166398066862
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	29.75046079761603
Whisper.	808.5262989580134
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	21.32705912598983
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	35.683225826033784
Wellcut frockcoat.	711.3009653190022
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	33.46196676388118
Well, it is a long rest.	42.923545923243985
Feel no more.	173.4549542141163
It ’ s the moment you feel.	38.984620659652876
Must be damned unpleasant.	115.53712384190031
Can ’ t believe it at first.	50.75085559606983
Mistake must be: someone else.	51.232820204380715
Try the house opposite.	106.05116757827325
Wait, I wanted to.	69.59647048108864
I haven ’ t yet.	231.77981731993464
Then darkened deathchamber.	934.4946353746477
Light they want.	116.14444244447664
Whispering around you.	165.49959036625415
Would you like to see a priest?	37.38237671953028
Then rambling and wandering.	415.86026552057393
Delirium all you hid all your life.	55.693150474036834
His sleep is not natural.	222.7027678702565
Press his lower eyelid.	154.27744248794457
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	17.79339618231513
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	17.17376977525744
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	10.708581002772089
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	55.693150474036834
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	67.73263075336398
Bam! He expires.	154.27744248794457
Gone at last.	290.9420807687356
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	25.595475082053845
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	36.07998051094464
Remember him in your prayers.	67.04414874507418
Even Parnell.	405.25432106605103
Ivy day dying out.	154.27744248794457
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	26.89346844121396
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	47.02076210925273
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	38.44965616942778
Nice change of air.	96.96374605486405
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	22.821692388797562
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	20.708883259522644
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	32.839551213240746
Someone walking over it.	68.63154182248914
Near you.	318.62214531503554
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	13.302684206285408
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	36.460744362930896
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	24.040609293513544
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	53.134917611457205
And if he was alive all the time?	63.5764909978373
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	16.100526789984904
Of course he is dead.	66.14851418170896
Monday he died.	183.1684056623006
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	15.007183748584822
Flag of distress.	284.3169932778216
Three days.	437.4890931006966
Rather long to keep them in summer.	35.05342402851812
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	17.33530903379414
The clay fell softer.	423.1963682690693
Begin to be forgotten.	87.18501742048566
Out of sight, out of mind.	37.97344540186808
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	38.471626903065655
Had enough of it.	113.01097724335501
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	17.471659965811085
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	17.113567425682074
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	21.622033958633562
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	41.232812167689204
Ah, the names.	337.706602049334
But he knows them all.	147.51981213761616
No: coming to me.	149.9140365748929
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	53.89294220963485
What is your christian name?	230.48937057455055
I ’ m not sure.	186.33911008907413
Leopold.	1333.8790432839612
He asked me to.	242.50397413370447
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	244.9036900782978
I know.	673.9878567531914
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	25.45429734573401
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	49.73989312532972
Find out what they imagine they know.	41.232812167689204
He died of a Tuesday.	158.54063750158457
Got the run.	122.01879817148743
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	45.42570298685798
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	62.103666607957805
That was why he asked me to.	103.56697528866243
O well, does no harm.	110.74781625796946
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	89.25774899389253
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	31.606385155538348
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	36.460744362930896
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	30.56375793981347
He looked around.	607.817082164269
— Macintosh.	8263.997203702196
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	44.15025819356773
Where is he now?	180.45534701236494
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	111.70850386436926
I don ’ t know who he is.	148.99070649790016
Is that his name?	86.21584743333779
He moved away, looking about him.	32.005962997155606
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	64.35258331954705
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	50.11892792216469
What?	2342.5114089148965
Where has he disappeared to?	271.36066811865044
Not a sign.	126.0843490085307
Well of all the.	145.9710200883742
Has anybody here seen?	78.18902805504202
Kay ee double ell.	106.94871078683059
Become invisible.	711.3009653190022
Good Lord, what became of him?	36.04937988818407
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	33.698849530545374
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	62.743545420225125
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	24.649111540024546
It rose.	675.5942791397385
Nearly over.	410.5471886343227
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	26.090314329159618
All uncovered again for a few instants.	53.718663391104336
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	24.180204436406825
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	27.923097460261882
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	54.938141217802496
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	25.60213911701197
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	17.122717103640706
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	36.460744362930896
His navelcord.	2903.4841098907514
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	31.819033301466177
Thanks in silence.	203.4168759506166
Sorry, sir: trouble.	64.41582805787725
Headshake.	3279.475308279624
I know that.	355.3884583586811
For yourselves just.	269.8692605656363
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	11.910843414639286
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	32.72889458521273
— Let us, Mr Power said.	105.98970394148725
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	51.29493643955842
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	23.13749763278353
That the coffin was filled with stones.	39.46819355592906
That one day he will come again.	39.46819355592906
Hynes shook his head.	98.27978219799586
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	99.90363336202603
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	78.59624185363393
Peace to his ashes.	106.94871078683059
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	11.397130983388577
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	22.35998927900685
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	45.80769578143616
Does anybody really?	139.51072303843034
Plant him and have done with him.	77.25740680348999
Like down a coalshoot.	155.81942904373335
Then lump them together to save time.	107.86944636848081
All souls ’ day.	146.14620725100127
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	56.58820366451404
Ten shillings for the gardener.	60.49900785026797
He keeps it free of weeds.	153.71030072150984
Old man himself.	166.7996882428697
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	55.693150474036834
Near death ’ s door.	63.002517352808816
Who passed away.	1032.5646594129869
Who departed this life.	451.92301940532735
As if they did it of their own accord.	31.993257347150504
Got the shove, all of them.	37.596874612254695
Who kicked the bucket.	451.92301940532735
So and So, wheelwright.	250.44911977644475
I travelled for cork lino.	226.73698664214498
I paid five shillings in the pound.	92.08866080210362
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	30.572280744927646
I cooked good Irish stew.	226.73698664214498
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	17.96476435648045
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	55.693150474036834
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	68.11226293301165
The great physician called him home.	153.14632269331
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	32.548694165774485
Nice country residence.	162.84377568298098
Newly plastered and painted.	154.27744248794457
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	17.381480408588143
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	38.44965616942778
Better value that for the money.	55.39877700048943
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	39.287316348062
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	53.19161366206981
Expresses nothing.	711.3009653190022
Immortelles.	3279.475308279624
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	58.89699035871132
Like stuffed.	721.9916333829775
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	45.42570298685798
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	22.318352153055603
Dead animal even sadder.	74.78012987794695
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	12.703315043076628
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	83.2233814680901
Heart on his sleeve.	93.37079519235303
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	16.764562525164653
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	32.40787108493922
Seems anything but pleased.	98.39170191856822
Why this infliction?	1143.5556020880456
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	13.63479107315004
Apollo that was.	284.3169932778216
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	26.15629956146456
Besides how could you remember everybody?	50.217353439008264
Eyes, walk, voice.	44.473407959588286
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	37.38729751849149
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	27.826516142549856
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	52.59468761573086
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	38.44965616942778
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	20.104354883002582
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	26.66288564992641
For instance who?	135.30792370129217
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	18.512257792746407
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	71.85002890012079
Wait.	365.9458717894147
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	22.53904155943526
Some animal.	322.2260251749698
Wait.	365.9458717894147
There he goes.	190.94762195864448
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	34.92644374041109
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	20.731670616253457
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	30.479185418005407
Good hidingplace for treasure.	115.89730217705687
Who lives there?	1032.5646594129869
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	55.37694356536539
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	23.078519001747967
Making his rounds.	154.26572091933093
Tail gone now.	284.3169932778216
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	20.267832811125995
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	38.44965616942778
Ordinary meat for them.	154.27744248794457
A corpse is meat gone bad.	98.11438197467672
Well and what ’ s cheese?	75.16728356602782
Corpse of milk.	165.49959036625415
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	24.20767902044043
Cremation better.	711.3009653190022
Priests dead against it.	154.27744248794457
Devilling for the other firm.	99.69176780614801
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	71.85002890012079
Time of the plague.	113.5238545183206
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	99.69176780614801
Lethal chamber.	711.3009653190022
Ashes to ashes.	183.1684056623006
Or bury at sea.	463.4502143425689
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	73.46182981308299
Eaten by birds.	183.1684056623006
Earth, fire, water.	72.82237374211775
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	59.52652616232427
See your whole life in a flash.	130.21378109961728
But being brought back to life no.	80.55600123559344
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	36.37249408872694
Out of a flying machine.	60.928011634006666
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	25.823980849795166
Underground communication.	711.3009653190022
We learned that from them.	240.49100882463858
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	60.069975339796734
Regular square feed for them.	72.82237374211775
Got wind of Dignam.	119.67238528563841
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	45.698593121092784
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	24.649111540024546
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	66.79888779276757
Back to the world again.	66.47866443302057
Enough of this place.	16.902509535053788
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	40.637855059306744
Poor papa too.	158.88893298493844
The love that kills.	423.1963682690693
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	14.616099223375148
Give you the creeps after a bit.	42.876976973037614
I will appear to you after death.	80.10887459054972
You will see my ghost after death.	65.48859885704583
My ghost will haunt you after death.	44.60309288422465
There is another world after death named hell.	34.88344763181157
I do not like that other world she wrote.	76.14154175468637
No more do I.	177.2326657964727
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	45.42570298685798
Feel live warm beings near you.	52.75843191756596
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	35.03031320823292
They are not going to get me this innings.	44.31329469814496
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	51.232820204380715
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	32.34145497072847
Solicitor, I think.	154.27744248794457
I know his face.	185.80305435930094
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	24.156544278984196
Dignam used to be in his office.	55.56717026325266
Convivial evenings.	711.3009653190022
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	27.940517896863163
Heart of gold really.	64.72680652418559
Yes, Menton.	3685.1437981541176
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	18.09570307634023
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	40.637855059306744
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	59.271785906146526
Hate at first sight.	96.16032387952906
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	26.676694313003356
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	11.802249288984472
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	27.548958776061642
Carriage probably.	711.3009653190022
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	97.21296032522399
They stopped.	2836.4491262052948
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	76.1499546040302
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	22.688588670204084
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	180.17343335602996
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	13.822514469513207
He clapped the hat on his head again.	93.16109885713412
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	91.63399992860172
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	26.20851345822809
— Thank you, he said shortly.	182.5948414795039
They walked on towards the gates.	143.47880384918665
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	19.0534169580218
Martin laying down the law.	97.70396217373246
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	19.948005660632973
Oyster eyes.	711.3009653190022
Never mind.	4902.906685286244
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	31.788655282931515
Get the pull over him that way.	48.05533459620843
Thank you.	135.8266345621182
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	10.403373186585766
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	12.084816964153697
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	22.378081061055916
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	13.128430614378951
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	15.976563143056719
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	26.06094561197498
— There it is, Red Murray said.	277.2629921797881
Alexander Keyes.	302.17778948094315
— Just cut it out, will you?	74.52279882914658
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	27.682938194905088
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	41.51229837174877
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	12.291249265468322
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	14.153321086637467
Scissors and paste.	284.3169932778216
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	58.159400964477534
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	17.60117043918385
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	134.55887278625087
I ’ ll rub that in.	146.11191529418096
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	17.306002270262727
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	99.69176780614801
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	18.28151555542089
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	83.2233814680901
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	19.50397188189176
Welts of flesh behind on him.	71.85002890012079
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	29.698477238832638
— Don ’ t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	48.28946146616374
Red Murray whispered.	91.83756833177384
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	28.568133155592456
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	38.44925580191415
Way in.	523.5436006047171
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	21.081805524104333
Mary, Martha.	161.2259711689697
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	22.989666103795667
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	101.9189466998409
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	258.96134769861413
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	47.98077483775765
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	38.44965616942778
Hand on his heart.	154.27744248794457
In <URL> Co - ome thou lost one, Co - ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	16.0731088141285
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	63.582365156476826
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	12.927268627855018
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	14.288393377173595
But will he save the circulation?	143.25349723105114
Thumping.	922.757229076909
Thumping.	922.757229076909
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	29.112476791806156
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	17.743480582287617
WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably.	14.694238905223433

His machineries are pegging away too.	145.16435036620675
Like these, got out of hand: fermenting.	38.65880059497155
Working away, tearing away.	67.73263075336398
And that old grey rat tearing to get in.	41.79476289486131
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	15.539683183738896
Strange he never saw his real country.	40.637855059306744

Now if he got paralysed there and no - one knew how to stop them they ’ d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.	14.031874358174033

Want a cool head.	95.42895075024438
— Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	69.35595075969519
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	39.65365638331428
Long John is backing him, they say.	35.683512510561044
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	13.588078517791295
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	46.256422559888065
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	75.4142781004626
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	47.75421143826352
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	24.49342361645975
— Did you?	811.3315435433188
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	259.69506222149846
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	50.57023953826047
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	131.28042093182094
I ’ ll tap him too.	146.11191529418096
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	58.86014304342205
Three bob I lent him in Meagher ’ s.	26.383801790128004
Three weeks.	437.4890931006966
Third hint.	410.5471886343227
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	19.05511760278557
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	92.43861185645186
Keyes, you remember?	87.18501742048566
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	46.85714953602489
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	54.17608243681929
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	24.98775808021248
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	121.82107017506836
He wants it changed.	52.9050469919457
Keyes, you see.	87.2056674907955
He wants two keys at the top.	27.28547812753114
Hell of a racket they make.	39.137487389988074
He doesn ’ t hear it.	143.35357335274279
Nannan.	3279.475308279624
Iron nerves.	361.65629589290785
Maybe he understands what I.	66.47866443302057
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	12.116616404213879
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	50.61284258160179
Let him take that in first.	121.32185721012054
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	10.449739771239852
Clank it.	345.2276592150924
Clank it.	345.2276592150924
Miles of it unreeled.	106.94871078683059
What becomes of it after?	228.72009114248254
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	27.318983004168654
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	19.05511760278557
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	28.263896839993226
Two crossed keys here.	113.0654717611853
A circle.	2298.027198408115
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	28.16409397958367
So on.	1730.6568084349083
Better not teach him his own business.	32.25161196648115
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	51.63798616512364
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	47.01678465067058
You see?	177.22046986577473
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	34.01062453746477
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	14.548620625335376
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	55.223902466277856
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	57.05709655084885
Innuendo of home rule.	154.27744248794457
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	30.53149915702208
Catches the eye, you see.	71.86279196654937
Can you do that?	77.59024035401691
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	19.032384574363398
Better not.	208.0846709926212
— We can do that, the foreman said.	69.11459189267204
Have you the design?	97.96177488523385
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	139.72848466814543
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	46.955998931075904
He has a house there too.	81.4350661060766
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	49.784623291246675
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	21.64792201493985
Longfelt want.	711.3009653190022
So on.	1730.6568084349083
The foreman thought for an instant.	38.387364812169075
— We can do that, he said.	86.96404479399564
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	56.28022279626772
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	93.79034352900702
He began to check it silently.	31.368894139536735
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	14.876473536613538
ORTHOGRAPHICAL Want to be sure of his spelling.	45.42570298685798

Silly, isn ’ t it?	41.77242052854585
Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	41.692902793453584
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	42.6646643065394
Thank you.	135.8266345621182
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	35.134428956634714
No. I could have said.	109.25981073985034

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	54.30988237636249
— Monks, sir?	685.8713514902869
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	164.79853313064524
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	71.04244945501311
Time to get out.	68.20391554053202
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	20.685194083710247
— Monks! — Yes, sir.	127.72616350645079
Three months ’ renewal.	111.57793483174243

Old Monks, the dayfather.	68.11226293301165
Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	11.760601394157307
Nearing the end of his tether now.	62.92384588325196
Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I ’ d say.	24.649111540024546

Reads it backwards first.	154.27744248794457

No, that ’ s the other.	188.5308985268735

And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher.	17.858873186474664
And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	17.142686845438508
Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.	24.479554237898064
Justice it means but it ’ s everybody eating everyone else.	27.94877836973518
That ’ s what life is after all.	35.70425527208084
Practice makes perfect.	183.1684056623006
Seems to see with his fingers.	36.562871367872546
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	20.43325118172163
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	28.33233636360806
Better phone him up first.	74.06280081808505
Number?	2179.400143858039

Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches?	47.683600557456806
Looks as if they did it for a bet.	24.79009223471228
Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works.	30.06571936269872

He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose.	50.11406427864227

Ah, the soap I put there.	93.89155521696328
Lose it out of that pocket.	59.52652616232427
Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	13.975879058377343
What perfume does your wife use?	127.7091349860668
I could go home still: tram: something I forgot.	38.74186783008566
Just to see: before: dressing.	41.17471118946218
No. Here.	555.9764709036942
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	30.823773281715795
Know who that is.	89.26558162626948
What ’ s up?	195.05069337178557
Ned Lambert it is.	112.20317066756863
He entered softly.	618.4323586038581
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	15.114749729883131
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	11.476852930098708
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	8.6388295060275
What about that, Simon?	126.12001731367349
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	45.39562703305522
How ’ s that for high?	38.80159734844468
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	129.0761345013808
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	13.131669242337205
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	16.24075369989996
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	57.84088808306825
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	56.5514420078803
High falutin stuff.	116.14444244447664
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	32.31897427824341
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	24.240276991326876
He has influence they say.	169.30678846993175
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	22.23375945619503
Close on ninety they say.	72.82237374211775
Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps.	38.44965616942778

— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	74.70391467600189
— What is it?	290.6756016970602
Mr Bloom asked.	81.84529962123028
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	30.728573990838694
_Our lovely land_.	284.3169932778216
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	45.42570298685798
Mr Bloom said simply.	103.17469252257564
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	187.406820142508
With an accent on the whose.	121.17869476961945
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	99.90363336202603
— Is it his speech last night?	93.38011079063095
Mr Bloom asked.	81.84529962123028
— But listen to this, he said.	128.25390617412555
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	27.179830178081904

O ’ Molloy said, entering.	74.55639377901748
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	70.61409066503658
— I beg yours, he said.	269.12600247194695
— Good day, Jack.	249.1570619041405
— Come in.	5719.973517578621
Come in.	312.04557423799486
— Good day.	1285.1465804050497
— How are you, Dedalus?	155.11817619319345
And yourself?	2855.8208262703706
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy shook his head.	135.48118669700983
SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	32.37392317481726
Decline, poor chap.	106.94871078683059
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	44.24727016593238
Touch and go with him.	48.620779089691396
What ’ s in the wind, I wonder.	60.50086765899424
Money worry.	31.20997052122985
— _Or again if we but climb the serried mountain <URL> — You ’ re looking extra.	41.20410914813747
— Is the editor to be seen?	293.5071643836385
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	43.1869834593337
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	75.32224931012176
To be seen and heard.	147.15706812968764
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	148.08533035142526
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	22.132010907505595
Practice dwindling.	410.5471886343227
A mighthavebeen.	2298.027198408115
Losing heart.	711.3009653190022
Gambling.	3279.475308279624
Debts of honour.	284.3169932778216
Reaping the whirlwind.	284.3169932778216
Used to get good retainers from D.	43.62316795256754
and T.	193.04633723199225
Fitzgerald.	3279.475308279624
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	42.37327781679854
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	38.44965616942778
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	22.989666103795667
Wellread fellow.	711.3009653190022
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	15.654744253431618
Weathercocks.	3279.475308279624
Hot and cold in the same breath.	35.05342402851812
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	34.772944196831084
One story good till you hear the next.	45.43280548811966
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	20.884675779825876
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	43.62316795256754
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	37.43247968450148
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	17.30682839039679
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	8.869376423441766
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	54.58606516877998
Is he taking anything for it?	49.493991252722545
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	9.859711317169848
He forgot Hamlet.	959.9408157110453
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	36.73744399882643
Life is too short.	67.03229147364517
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	20.120966149380916
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	28.536638447271308
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	23.155946776566875
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	244.9036900782978
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	13.842371800255483
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	26.744119409186787
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	122.27348925087128
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	99.69176780614801
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	21.288767513393463
Hooked that nicely.	284.3169932778216
Entertainments.	3279.475308279624
Open house.	300.0997692734887
Big blowout.	417.14551309158657
Wetherup always said that.	154.27744248794457
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	27.948634033223637
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	19.256548190528544
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	23.474023199266657
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	62.056051186107524
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	47.406483361384524
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	49.072331605812174
I must get a drink after that.	60.64246714934669
— Drink! the editor cried.	356.19058970806174
No drinks served before mass.	224.81190698655448
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	70.22367632113257
Come on, Ned.	77.13315139993337
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	48.64647346429618
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	24.43475668725259
— Will you join us, Myles?	92.57750587673452
Ned Lambert asked.	83.74905733738183
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	21.01668582718678
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	26.35787620383104
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	27.609242195055682
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	139.35386849198778
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	25.08542311971097
Passing out he whispered to J.	50.40191784567241
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	76.65905536622721
Sad case.	240.03748873294705
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	44.02631000522967
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	25.511133216283934
Long, short and long.	100.84292040675469
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	13.344268784351362
— Bingbang, bangbang.	791.3955546268766
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	19.230287250450967
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	53.55420129774289
I just want to phone about an ad.	61.603141648849366
He went in.	395.477157586629
— What about that leader this evening?	116.43268047763688
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	20.10486406634645
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	119.33855250206746
Never you fret.	1332.0575895618188
Hello, Jack.	168.84649321281512
That ’ s all right.	66.31761080132888
— Good day, Myles, J.	113.55665728490203
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	20.437981707032737
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	40.81057153439012
The telephone whirred inside.	293.36956372985276
— Twentyeight...	791.3955546268766
Double four...	106.94871078683059
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	21.346692336730378
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	74.87969633761816
he asked.	136.3611024919681
Sceptre with O.	284.3169932778216
Madden up.	24.990771238543836
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	70.47025221236848
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	21.346692336730378
— Hush, Lenehan said.	404.8637341755854
I hear feetstoops.	366.9498681625664
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	12.110786179369684
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	20.055609049373114
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	133.9017339395657
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	27.88525342536741
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	54.806404180977175
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	45.12602869616535
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	18.034702900481445
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	62.290071880633
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	42.365848979642195
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	55.55657705945614
— Him, sir.	791.3955546268766
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	87.22430334155013
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	55.55657705945614
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	18.25590623170008
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	43.49943182992801
Is the boss...?	53.452307786538796
Yes, _Telegraph_...	621.4561002804185
To where?	3423.817714897118
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	27.46667289657581
Aha! I see...	38.3095848159252
Right.	375.323769667352
I ’ ll catch him.	224.36491181565262
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	42.67779103330059
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	21.9831168164699
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	38.77880956774701
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	71.36004422590375
Are you hurt?	1241.336962490888
I ’ m in a hurry.	219.21634560827505
— Knee, Lenehan said.	404.8637341755854
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	12.345825450059946
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	259.69506222149846
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	31.799277212759677
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	75.45070339408493
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	14.568298684458219
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	20.132766386596682
Want to fix it up.	71.11218392684238
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	39.936006996817696
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	57.84225629347732
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	17.767178344172432
— Begone! he said.	404.8637341755854
The world is before you.	172.94128814290227
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	63.57010164703905
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	17.567566609622247
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	41.30902428043955
Look at the young scamps after him.	33.437944053543745
— Show.	4201.775006195741
Where?	3823.0177472484206
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	48.402218245554586
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	14.293893052778651
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	17.53969781564433
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	25.06133419527205
Small nines.	361.65629589290785
Steal upon larks.	284.3169932778216
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	13.034067962648392
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	43.95442949224582
— What ’ s that?	163.73218576815398
Myles Crawford said with a start.	51.4357127326882
Where are the other two gone?	98.05530564308337
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
the professor said, turning.	66.0587946279515
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	36.60785309667204
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	128.52676091321877
Came over last night.	98.27978219799586
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	215.67852429453026
Where ’ s my hat?	518.221777373539
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	18.44499658447439
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	27.33976832567928
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	74.2367213726569
— Seems to be, J.	186.05878092647762
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	17.332740809436498
Who has the most matches?	161.83570205777474
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	32.606331638736656
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	21.63568707491794
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	51.07238745746526
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	123.1779069057385
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	33.538912662436545
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	19.32465758074746
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	66.79888779276757
— Eh?	4010.904735824013
You bloody old Roman empire?	268.9319832222862
Myles Crawford said.	77.8239332080834
He took a cigarette from the open case.	50.180192386954886
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	12.89001243158867
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said gently.	208.2264115046479
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	54.43280363773771
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	46.14320705024248
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	33.76692070186411
— That ’ s it, he said.	263.9293338537979
We are the fat.	259.4240773514406
You and I are the fat in the fire.	59.20494626852352
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	43.898715500041014
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	28.727959976184668
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	33.56842951566475
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	55.92953378698993
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	28.189702044976332
Vast, I allow: but vile.	55.693150474036834
Cloacae: sewers.	284.3169932778216
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	26.206139885859656
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	73.94624397560823
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	13.791191074010603
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	22.606929874736924
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	26.783389321363718
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	13.20386714222337
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	75.80785346947354
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy murmured.	359.394828842039
But we have also Roman law.	97.75677545069652
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	106.3048594701475
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	71.33999757733511
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy asked.	228.94627323396057
Everything was going swimmingly...	50.40191784567241
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	129.7511806500045
Are you ready?	1241.336962490888
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	16.09248234093532
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	20.25567443227185
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	99.90363336202603
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	54.58606516877998
— How do you do?	199.26136039346295
the editor said, holding out a hand.	29.610170846632364
Come in.	312.04557423799486
Your governor is just gone.	76.16604259547216
???	711.3009653190022
Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	20.43197337835963
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	55.693150474036834
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	36.40424432009643
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
the editor asked.	163.2403749156616
Bit torn off.	31.069451104000514
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	98.89518567971005
— That old pelters, the editor said.	118.6581974277142
Who tore it?	1032.5646594129869
Was he short taken?	330.30790816448035
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	25.141368463361143
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	49.27525936172708
Foot and mouth?	154.26572091933093
Are you turned...?	180.50167677084545
Bullockbefriending bard.	410.5471886343227
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	81.29436557594293
The letter is not mine.	172.94128814290227
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	62.907202475634506
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	32.30096636000228
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	109.1343468108211
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	12.093290113850964
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	38.44965616942778
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	25.369980703376093
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	103.69817638840276
— Is he a widower?	747.2009005603036
Stephen asked.	792.1898455895542
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	53.37611685822814
Emperor ’ s horses.	106.94871078683059
Habsburg.	3279.475308279624
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	48.939276150823964
Don ’ t you forget! Maximilian Karl O ’ Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	17.36259370256053
Going to be trouble there one day.	30.550171339051357
Wild geese.	361.65629589290785
O yes, every time.	36.39164760977589
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	15.733227933446416
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	51.42166073432583
Saving princes is a thank you job.	55.693150474036834
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	50.96635471177582
— And if not?	2435.554447313133
he said.	141.38141645313658
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	66.67927803682718
A Hungarian it was one day...	72.61433484527782
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	19.055659866975873
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	24.649111540024546
We were never loyal to the successful.	80.6090416504458
We serve them.	975.4795816140708
I teach the blatant Latin language.	147.46268464768747
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	22.8581522458117
Material domination.	711.3009653190022
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	38.44965616942778
Lord Jesus?	441.1714971655803
Lord Salisbury?	441.1714971655803
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	18.060389656151486
— The Greek! he said again.	120.92166578202324
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	21.346692336730378
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	36.460744362930896
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	39.66614610629912
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	17.79339618231513
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	13.05742239329689
They went under.	487.5422778315324
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	16.973094948692264
Loyal to a lost cause.	72.82237374211775
He strode away from them towards the window.	83.46847464911093
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	48.9104033833207
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	93.80260945102032
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	26.898613627813717
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	11.769410512049468
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	23.025112392083745
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	61.35749546228909
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	21.66340005037475
Whose mother is beastly dead.	72.82237374211775
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	45.92293644061997
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	69.96096747532039
I ’ ll read the rest after.	122.09701931923574
That ’ ll be all right.	32.43806564595565
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	56.265814785722306
— But my riddle! he said.	127.20899677176033
What opera is like a railwayline?	162.0391989178715
— Opera?	8263.997203702196
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	34.57986072274884
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	32.186143576529
See the wheeze?	107.531098211688
Rows of cast steel.	92.68823457328038
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	38.621050629452675
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	20.55018134052115
— Help! he sighed.	404.8637341755854
I feel a strong weakness.	167.78800741547144
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	16.925153328168285
— Paris, past and present, he said.	93.80260945102032
You look like communards.	277.49524272263966
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	53.42996768649055
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	98.76308172028166
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	40.53429565874484
You look as though you had done the deed.	64.67765603782281
General Bobrikoff.	211.0500139360508
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	28.263896839993226
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	73.01055296351907
Law, the classics...	54.58606516877998
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	120.92166578202324
— Literature, the press.	404.8637341755854
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	186.5012086798685
The gentle art of advertisement.	236.75172691695573
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	179.30078006260078
The vocal muse.	954.3116359862598
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	72.82237374211775
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	75.38901298232933
— Ahem! he said very softly.	165.65170223267376
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	26.3758874846625
The gate was open.	423.1963682690693
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	20.255872598202405
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	77.24844535368081
Something with a bite in it.	54.3715065252398
You can do it.	259.40466264238484
I see it in your face.	113.28420526188984
_In the lexicon of youth_...	38.06811779753282
See it in your face.	262.80245248953173
See it in your eye.	173.87240552235804
Lazy idle little schemer.	95.28046934674923
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	63.361551458116104
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	25.595475082053845
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	20.942630038864962
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	25.595475082053845
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	24.784340761501802
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	39.562762755234594
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	59.217578220767955
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	74.81931282169046
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said.	225.0055124649451
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	26.945002265181838
Wait a minute.	231.1145903052165
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	18.86114684419523
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	40.69468172599325
That was a pen.	61.987564646992126
You know how he made his mark?	71.74814665031644
I ’ ll tell you.	98.08425474565716
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	47.789759649520114
I ’ ll show you.	173.66662610664523
He pushed past them to the files.	85.76219546386494
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	83.2233814680901
Remember that time?	105.10727635296284
Professor MacHugh nodded.	111.14164052383512
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	47.36553160269628
Where it took place.	496.21661345030253
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	55.693150474036834
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	87.78615459100506
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	214.86901586964018
Whole route, see?	98.27978219799586
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	53.29030823185297
Fitzharris.	3279.475308279624
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	29.17634662622365
Holohan told me.	183.1684056623006
You know Holohan?	696.2594334371399
— Hop and carry one, is it?	121.17483189934644
Myles Crawford said.	77.8239332080834
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	38.234629041297374
A night watchman.	726.5144068847064
Stephen turned in surprise.	61.1100465906107
— Gumley?	8263.997203702196
he said.	141.38141645313658
You don ’ t say so?	43.637612852708415
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	89.36780391653195
Look at here.	86.01591727065731
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	664.8229135835005
I ’ ll tell you.	98.08425474565716
Inspiration of genius.	284.3169932778216
Cabled right away.	284.3169932778216
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	123.29573194061742
Right.	375.323769667352
Have you got that?	272.0021457600263
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	27.97446513713741
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	42.188285100570255
Have you got that?	272.0021457600263
Right.	375.323769667352
The telephone whirred.	614.805815344912
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	66.089062768384
— B is parkgate.	791.3955546268766
Good.	452.94603954592435
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	53.477793757542244
— T is viceregal lodge.	404.8637341755854
C is where murder took place.	71.68901683409469
K is Knockmaroon gate.	535.1805167889706
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	38.65144518755752
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	27.198174082730446
— Hello?	4730.5412713921805
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	99.69176780614801
Hello?...	156.8730591753156

Yes...	548.9468135803311
Yes...	548.9468135803311
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
— F to P is the route Skin - the - Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	24.2195683022528
<URL>. Got that?	107.1779123150632
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	25.93657067345649
The professor came to the inner door.	85.48243185742561
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	90.48200181509506
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	63.870314977943636
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	33.460695566409285
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	45.42570298685798
Very.	875.632711689606
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	33.5766605134137
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	55.693150474036834
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	184.03350663922896
I was present.	3709.602131271487
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	16.179187308771795
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	21.39875097355743
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	79.20866256232009
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	174.62911168223235
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	52.73153200352305
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	39.24851527389688
Out of an advertisement.	86.85998635604159
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	55.693150474036834
That gave him the leg up.	69.52771849452989
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <URL> Now he ’ s got in with Blumenfeld.	21.504818535996108
That ’ s press.	154.53069458605435
That ’ s talent.	154.53069458605435
Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	15.138244982324869
— Hello?...	294.349666046476
Are you there?...	180.50167677084545
Yes, he ’ s here still.	259.9725542471695
Come across yourself.	311.3679482387904
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	39.244515435868934
the editor cried.	163.2403749156616
He flung the pages down.	158.54063750158457
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	71.33592969847842
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	60.11712106663611
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	33.24927660467467
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	28.417669849849002
— O yes, J.	434.63050644834516
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	208.2264115046479
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	11.082041083771651
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin - the - Goat.	32.58746704207887
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! — They ’ re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	16.523791374317312
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	11.49491735393045
Eh?	373.70694353851286
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	41.232812167689204
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	38.726594585346035
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	44.89949649127149
Why did you write it then?	333.2717789248968
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	71.85002890012079
Is the mouth south someway?	71.09635120495807
Or the south a mouth?	127.81811959164207
Must be some.	129.46533838849604
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	30.06571936269872
Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two.	21.346692336730378

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, _per l ’ aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più <URL> But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.	10.061404264955176
— Speak up for yourself, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	54.767496292157134
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...	71.85002890012079

O ’ Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	37.115855346862446
— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	26.622538425080826
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	16.32899491965104
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	36.123732257887575
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly ’ s Budget_, _Pue ’ s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	10.813167301999314
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	59.7595738551068
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	45.42570298685798
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE — Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.	16.040536741099192
Irish volunteers.	350.02061860370287
Where are you now?	214.60998779775227

Dr Lucas.	292.1187024185887
Who have you now like John Philpot Curran?	86.56829749635875
Psha! — Well, J.	55.86978659912605
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said, Bushe <URL>., for example.	30.435154441694525
— Bushe?	8263.997203702196
the editor said.	105.16599401359217
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	44.85663527426434
He has a strain of it in his blood.	44.85503417016229
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	55.693150474036834
— He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....	43.5379728990583
But no matter.	857.6065223621779
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	14.297591119674031
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	21.094369371148943
Bushe defended him.	284.3169932778216
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	16.419166343477578
He died in his sleep.	158.54063750158457
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	47.96710863718525
— What was that?	495.7866714103835
the professor asked.	102.97556949354656
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	22.835668072001415
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	17.628041981503618
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	44.40163255739916
— Ha. — A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	56.356117383220784
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	76.65905536622721
False lull.	711.3009653190022
Something quite ordinary.	182.01781171673682
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	27.86044346574022
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	13.172661472566295
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	337.1606960464125
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	9.895416892604706
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	92.43861185645186
— The divine afflatus, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	51.452587813975136
— You like it?	735.0097632698087
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy asked Stephen.	139.82997533506938
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	27.37108501492949
He took a cigarette from the case.	62.206513097877085
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	60.98474615670159
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: — Muchibus thankibus.	20.495784580458405
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	26.090314329159618
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	136.8733509724887
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	20.659513036347846
E.	349.8337578232202
the mastermystic?	482.9863955447851
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	52.177902194241504
A.	19938.206404913133
E.	349.8337578232202
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	13.195911611215232
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	45.42570298685798
E. ’ s leg.	98.39832876801128
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	31.590829566089464
Speaking about me.	165.49959036625415
What did he say?	136.48531633609701
What did he say?	136.48531633609701
What did he say about me?	94.07808732637169
Don ’ t ask.	117.96372886499265
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	87.43508688234454
Wait a moment.	129.61913288600624
Let me say one thing.	783.4114631697755
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	20.96180597963838
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	11.53571042401579
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	58.168863246467176
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	51.63793538811461
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	70.60327107910325
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	22.625329786425194
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	27.801062918580893
Go on.	220.52728743833293
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	15.792892916226386
It was then a new movement.	50.02932119473111
We were weak, therefore worthless.	108.91348772450311
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	12.169599232896342
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	55.693150474036834
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	22.16873178976639
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	15.06366030703238
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	34.36100220982479
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	20.10108972711392
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	52.508437270723896
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	22.220413560273887
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	29.721024814338275
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	17.128377980907597
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	19.21793083467864
He raised his head firmly.	161.53114011664627
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	87.87678640754989
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	28.063455112383746
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	11.29818073095529
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	9.05132243091848
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	34.65761793055778
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	32.99038585797351
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	12.855281132762109
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	12.16258799380117
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	71.70852355592999
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	16.351881684759704
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	28.109315966770257
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	13.15601858905858
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	17.860459625742454
Child, man, effigy.	72.82237374211775
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	13.119572446532024
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	9.973322229670144
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	18.15729194879218
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	16.11036383964698
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	9.618823836575391
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	10.637021544041382
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	71.85002890012079
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	22.197941373311743
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	16.01392067415603
And with a great future behind him.	70.60940332141278
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	28.143685879298417
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	268.1630869636442
Gone with the wind.	157.26745776790895
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	45.42570298685798
Miles of ears of porches.	72.82237374211775
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	39.7104816080165
A people sheltered within his voice.	129.14506950814115
Dead noise.	240.03748873294705
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	31.484440655360793
Love and laud him: me no more.	31.21189528586919
I have money.	854.6430668766149
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	404.8637341755854
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	17.594827456576308
— You take my breath away.	231.6967569380963
It is not perchance a French compliment?	33.70796732301868
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	75.48047273440588
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	12.93108373825678
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	90.76125167065378
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	22.119660554548453
The contrary no.	954.3116359862598
I declare it carried.	256.3329510850087
To which particular boosing shed...?	64.13581879505857
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	12.094397989819386
Yes, we will not.	453.95832970822994
By no manner of means.	65.83525073824565
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	10.807681082396549
Let us go.	473.596645760016
Where are those blasted keys?	194.71075260740716
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	46.256422559888065
— Foot and mouth.	548.6138020235005
I know.	673.9878567531914
That ’ ll be all right.	32.43806564595565
That ’ ll go in.	291.76970002008375
Where are they?	725.814618711767
That ’ s all right.	66.31761080132888
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	42.31101667406014
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	16.76306144006546
Myles, one moment.	154.11538089680147
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	39.0945865272657
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	139.17292269137963
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	33.50548509095222
It has the prophetic vision.	81.24945435762858
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	38.44965616942778
Kingdoms of this world.	154.27744248794457
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	83.2233814680901
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	11.566104332803562
I have much, much to learn.	102.64724961077471
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	63.40363700803765
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	123.28433997520885
— Yes?	4201.878980949647
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	29.59075494269283
Crawford will follow.	284.3169932778216
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	15.386867207471234
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	24.567635495376322
— Where is that?	465.6499255094792
the professor asked.	102.97556949354656
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	186.05878092647762
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	71.85002890012079
Against the wall.	143.3409013821524
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	41.232812167689204
Frantic hearts.	711.3009653190022
Akasic records.	410.5471886343227
Quicker, darlint! On now.	54.58606516877998
Dare it.	711.3009653190022
Let there be life.	486.9564768359013
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	29.462930828132553
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	39.936006996817696
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	22.62090236358176
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	23.4555010808891
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	19.438840144907918
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	172.58091523310264
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	12.256663316386314
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	22.42782961290117
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	10.472470154796603
Glory be to God.	95.28046934674923
They had no idea it was that high.	63.40363700803765
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	35.51917779205406
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	13.972212963127022
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	22.77175732414464
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	497.0280058183814
Vestal virgins.	711.3009653190022
I can see them.	277.3048622117298
What ’ s keeping our friend?	122.13859760426901
He turned.	19703.383085861893
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	19.755115309049266
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	14.786658550527914
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy.	439.914055251634
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	88.34660741346907
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	50.1067961862942
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	45.42570298685798
I see them.	379.52328756140906
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	10.199156801934675
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	44.57486469351645
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	12.628631065726797
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	82.65656807811129
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	27.141133615683362
After he ’ ll see.	77.99938281026297
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	21.536153946597977
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	21.78023727159841
I can have access to it in the national library.	45.25721174374119
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	16.208435299013992
His name is Keyes.	341.5037872359811
It ’ s a play on the name.	30.743101289156947
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	47.20643933586772
But he wants just a little puff.	59.16815409138386
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	61.17433564879624
<URL>. — Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	18.96707873073099
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	30.152266456874564
Tell him that straight from the stable.	91.92163581850211
Look out for squalls.	146.42481655146102
All off for a drink.	105.07707368863201
Arm in arm.	284.3169932778216
Lenehan ’ s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	26.355573191468405
Usual blarney.	410.5471886343227
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	32.41114852383416
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	24.036030936328462
Been walking in muck somewhere.	72.82237374211775
What was he doing in Irishtown?	85.3021185283443
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	31.65272768307764
He ’ d give the ad, I think.	100.95552390668021
I ’ ll tell him...	74.50518205307746
<URL>. — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	14.719462839760054
Any time he likes, tell him.	34.36562991192108
RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	28.48189584548375
I ’ m up to here.	151.69361474084278
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	75.84309628729494
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	38.852091266346946
Sorry, Jack.	154.26572091933093
You must take the will for the deed.	26.05468645601448
With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.	30.44465164224055

O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	43.95442949224582
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	63.582365156476826
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	16.76388241186068
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	66.73969829950067
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	21.527511046864618
SOME COLUMN! — THAT ’ S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID — That ’ s new, Myles Crawford said.	32.74672239583127
That ’ s copy.	154.53069458605435
Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	71.2244139770489
Two old trickies, what?	51.892821940938845
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	40.46046736285817
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	16.13175753396187
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	31.37977770369948
No poetic licence.	887.6195005876992
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	72.25824681103762
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	43.89305032042801
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	129.7511806500045
I like that.	487.39125834982025
I see the idea.	283.1124605346428
I see what you mean.	122.53387357279001
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	12.341136410751936
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	12.066380414169087
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	44.3421102570861
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	17.630836434813887
— Finished?	8263.997203702196
Myles Crawford said.	77.8239332080834
So long as they do no worse.	89.30487032503221
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	284.3169932778216
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	47.16375921151898
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	16.168062895017314
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	91.21173979621216
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	17.838038654711674
Poor Penelope.	466.94688142464145

They made ready to cross O ’ Connell street.	64.19360082926056
Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.	12.873810406574316
WHAT? — AND LIKEWISE — WHERE?	43.62316795256754
— But what do you call it?	147.04268569822247
Myles Crawford asked.	290.575373246723
Where did they get the plums?	47.81756891075913
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.	154.27744248794457

Call it, let me see.	39.49087395381383
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	17.913144486368804
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	19.23879784633803
He laughed richly.	471.0307172638321
— I see, he said again with new pleasure.	48.22044067431252

He halted on sir John Gray ’ s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.	16.39922480762432
DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS.	45.42570298685798

That tickles me, I must say.	54.09015902637716

Well, of course, if we knew all the things.	29.001497345351883
Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls.	20.295672269175178
Rough weather outside.	284.3169932778216
If I threw myself down?	294.6832598081526

They wheeled lower.	500.46556818557207
Looking for grub.	110.55085470597209
Wait.	365.9458717894147
He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball.	59.79887432204474
Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com.	17.79775591464674
Not a bit.	81.22859249673684
The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated under by the bridgepiers.	30.479185418005407
Not such damn fools.	137.5423130811939
Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin ’ s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern.	13.23796974631547
Live by their wits.	96.16032387952906
They wheeled, flapping.	247.14125763138512
The hungry famished gull Flaps o ’ er the waters dull.	47.55698136907987
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	29.138632015199672
But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse.	45.95121714429887
The flow of the language it is.	109.1343468108211

Wait.	365.9458717894147
Those poor birds.	187.72779819133592
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.	13.932169669585608
See that?	4808.144566744617
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey.	28.143685879298417

Every morsel.	264.2053497514561

Penny quite enough.	23.312818687034007
Lot of thanks I get.	66.47866443302057
They spread foot and mouth disease too.	153.84730120820404
If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that.	22.268109845805377

But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty?	29.21101770288648
How is that?	158.29235273956502
His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.	16.665757302055958

Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.	30.782821998113754
She ’ s not exactly witty.	114.34971762908252
Can be rude too.	163.61034134731324
Blurt out what I was thinking.	78.35301210780398
Still, I don ’ t know.	80.67860075972914
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.	39.66561548831844
He has legs like barrels and you ’ d think he was singing into a barrel.	25.672924078114544
Now, isn ’ t that wit.	184.80211701153513
They used to call him big Ben.	76.24832955856658
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	36.11542797944965
Appetite like an albatross.	154.27744248794457
Get outside of a baron of beef.	44.49321909313399
Barrel of Bass.	284.3169932778216
It all works out.	149.07019090684048
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	22.95680418751748
Bargains.	3279.475308279624
Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	17.48516185173693
He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H.	15.268908302462025

Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	14.876945220574838
Our staple food.	180.23193508959253
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	18.700829663648346
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	32.04324451338763
Doesn ’ t bring in any business either.	15.016441844033746
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	19.804370517392428
I bet that would have caught on.	105.52660202594883
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	30.06571936269872
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	24.71799175934051
Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing.	25.4676098200419
Women too.	155.17434788035484
Curiosity.	1575.979671522145
Pillar of salt.	284.3169932778216
Wouldn ’ t have it of course because he didn ’ t think of it himself first.	18.096968295385114
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid.	30.45765479899212
His ideas for ads like Plumtree ’ s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	28.560975853765672
You can ’ t lick ’ em.	68.91757610755784
What?	2342.5114089148965
Our envelopes.	402.3366152059914
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	37.51882857723618
Can ’ t stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser _Kansell, _ sold by Hely ’ s Ltd, <NUM> Dame street.	12.482706220612053
Well out of that ruck I am.	53.67572601789729

Sister?	30.114651215638453
Sister?	30.114651215638453
I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.	78.70659935913098
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	24.053643308974536
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	80.74317228624768
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	78.89405631603141
Our great day, she said.	54.03747244510515
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.	60.151929559078155
Sweet name too: caramel.	49.78915073502049
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	18.332803518014416
If she had married she would have changed.	34.69512189246159
I suppose they really were short of money.	50.755969844075224
Fried everything in the best butter all the same.	31.484440655360793
No lard for them.	398.4028579034586
My heart ’ s broke eating dripping.	33.02221072680365
They like buttering themselves in and out.	75.148126024336

How long ago is that?	72.70702501255185
Year Phil Gilligan died.	133.70618190237417
We were in Lombard street west.	109.30759761684259

Mantailored with selfcovered buttons.	154.27744248794457
She didn ’ t like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf.	22.431463483740107
As if that.	165.18173219526327
Old Goodwin ’ s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	22.23375945619503
Flies ’ picnic too.	154.27744248794457
Never put a dress on her back like it.	63.52852804759551
Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips.	38.44965616942778
Just beginning to plump it out well.	41.17471118946218
Rabbitpie we had that day.	99.69176780614801

Pen...?	106.94871078683059
Of course it ’ s years ago.	40.72443339908293
Noise of the trams probably.	99.69176780614801
Well, if he couldn ’ t remember the dayfather ’ s name that he sees every day.	17.880957472014032
Bartell d ’ Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	27.10157843530541
Seeing her home after practice.	67.73263075336398
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	71.85002890012079
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	29.51711164443535
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin ’ s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	12.256663316386314
He and I behind.	425.27559828986125
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	19.904035737903623
Lucky it didn ’ t.	79.24249174756716
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	24.160549876251476

Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.	22.835668072001415
She did get flushed in the wind.	83.16303506519886
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	12.412715343625962
And the mulled rum.	272.5243000950026
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	16.102706011893314
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	33.46196676388118
Always warm from her.	81.83901386657818
Always liked to let her self out.	36.495592927191645

— O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	67.81714791113833
— O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	91.60341489285953
— No use complaining.	776.5129818082469
How is Molly those times?	89.82149414394125
Haven ’ t seen her for ages.	42.82831775948766
— In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	117.84078102824715
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	26.562392247208287
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	33.497398796379635
— Yes.	1687.0603916768166
In a photographer ’ s there.	107.36179480247336
Getting on like a house on fire.	43.62316795256754
How are all your charges?	59.18339777692688
— All on the baker ’ s list, Mrs Breen said.	44.17026061006915
— You ’ re in black, I see.	60.91983036122516
You have no...	132.17936287374525
— No, Mr Bloom said.	109.91348042409025
I have just come from a funeral.	80.40123734295514
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	23.524497185970315
Who ’ s dead, when and what did he die of?	35.56645242181877
Turn up like a bad penny.	18.0097910458957
— O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	76.33607636064409
I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	61.04769802982769
May as well get her sympathy.	51.61664501767372
— Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	259.69506222149846
An old friend of mine.	48.44334902599041
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	79.89313551500906
Heart trouble, I believe.	64.82221014823543
Funeral was this morning.	98.27978219799586
Your funeral ’ s tomorrow While you ’ re coming through the rye.	21.739468096478607
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	99.69176780614801
— Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen ’ s womaneyes said melancholily.	32.421389595359805
Now that ’ s quite enough about that.	24.610319976832635
Just: quietly: husband.	92.55609993419625
— And your lord and master?	569.0474822203356
Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	54.58606516877998
— O, don ’ t be talking! she said.	72.03249839294361
He ’ s a caution to rattlesnakes.	167.76895986341643
He ’ s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	41.068742356800904
He has me heartscalded.	286.18927275442866
Wait till I show you.	41.455541127805034
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison ’ s.	16.038856851092874
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom ’ s gullet.	52.85398346507328
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they ’ d taste it with the hot tea.	13.416734588635645
Or is it from her?	173.88240952261438
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	37.60492156329145
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	55.693150474036834
Pleasure or pain is it?	99.69176780614801
Penny dinner.	31.20997052122985
Knife and fork chained to the table.	42.98631271372913
Opening her handbag, chipped leather.	71.85002890012079

Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle.	106.94871078683059
Pastille that was fell.	154.27744248794457
What is she?...	113.65130933007406
— There must be a new moon out, she said.	109.92393159815425
He ’ s always bad then.	379.8886623951946
Do you know what he did last night?	32.55742596458644
Her hand ceased to rummage.	51.9110956202321
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	18.24505460694816
— What?	1708.7588479661683
Mr Bloom asked.	81.84529962123028
Let her speak.	657.3886205571168
Look straight in her eyes.	96.06456160774196
I believe you.	440.7739220986797
Trust me.	410.5471886343227
— Woke me up in the night, she said.	83.05335024133592
Dream he had, a nightmare.	54.58606516877998
Indiges.	3279.475308279624
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	66.73969829950067
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	72.50637442941812
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	22.96098477196761
— Read that, she said.	244.9036900782978
He got it this morning.	173.66933671006979
— What is it?	290.6756016970602
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	45.41384258853561
U.	368.0643244858494
P.?	4064.3970850196015
— U.	8263.997203702196
p: up, she said.	71.76356734503389
Someone taking a rise out of him.	32.45507888708859
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	22.0326917033814
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	109.23402240254039
She took back the card, sighing.	33.31591639093783
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	75.55790918410139
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	40.541871016580814
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	42.62439043404075
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	21.212871863043084
Seen its best days.	106.94871078683059
Wispish hair over her ears.	99.69176780614801
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	23.468254752465125
Shabby genteel.	711.3009653190022
She used to be a tasty dresser.	91.13606784763557
Lines round her mouth.	106.94871078683059
Only a year or so older than Molly.	29.435207348798965
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	24.71451690884054
Cruel.	939.5186216197353
The unfair sex.	954.3116359862598

— Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	75.86135549034458
Mr Bloom asked.	81.84529962123028
— Mina Purefoy?	2022.6103650516063
she said.	331.2353408811903
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	99.69176780614801
Playgoers ’ Club.	284.3169932778216
Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.	59.52652616232427
Did I pull the chain?	67.50703012933384
Yes.	2652.1488126418053

Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: — Mind! Let this man pass.	19.349851340559788
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	18.947835585449113

Meshuggah.	3279.475308279624

He turned Combridge ’ s corner, still pursued.	137.0249643207529
Jingling, hoofthuds.	161.2259711689697
Perfumed bodies, warm, full.	54.58606516877998
All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.	14.144102562893274
— Jack, love! — Darling! — Kiss me, Reggy! — My boy! — Love! His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant.	17.8605230780559
Stink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens.	26.898613627813717
See the animals feed.	68.613854475659
Men, men, men.	16.703074473839205
Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches.	11.615330271406163
A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin.	28.1297777275623

Don ’ t! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne.	13.104292346772748
Wonder what he was eating.	48.3886810491041
Something galoptious.	407.32609807973233
Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity.	50.40191784567241
Couldn ’ t swallow it all however.	34.36562991192108
— Roast beef and cabbage.	404.8637341755854
— One stew.	165.84569276479448
Smells of men.	183.1684056623006
Spat - on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men ’ s beery piss, the stale of ferment.	14.322415470467176
His gorge rose.	875.9829679545652
Couldn ’ t eat a morsel here.	37.11693326953912
Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles.	10.036370559948294

Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.	22.989666103795667
He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.	26.915417885816193
— Two stouts here.	437.2511056149982

That ’ s witty, I think.	55.754082048460425

Silver means born rich.	106.94871078683059
Born with a knife.	16.902509535053788
But then the allusion is lost.	91.80328366389696
An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates.	118.03962143118123
Rock, the head bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard.	19.05511760278557
Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot.	37.30628733247314

Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips.	32.33031834786594
His eyes said: — Not here.	66.60895921884476

Who is this was telling me?	85.63277397104908
Isn ’ t Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?	31.004468543923416
A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom ’ s heart.	29.399121591964462

He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.	22.02656885882716
— Yes, he said.	431.5303014074171
No fear: no brains.	164.21954462767033
Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched.	66.56046995568006
Flea having a good square meal.	71.85002890012079
— He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks.	16.373536435808102
By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me...	14.985339428325176
Hope that dewdrop doesn ’ t come down into his glass.	26.679669841897976

Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin.	14.273212843400586
Herring ’ s blush.	154.27744248794457
Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete.	25.121786637262968
Too much fat on the parsnips.	116.58678773525128

Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?	21.753580981041697
— I ’ m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered.	57.43327780526519
I never put anything on a horse.	72.9500688623297
Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese.	14.470775787931172
Sips of his wine soothed his palate.	55.693150474036834
Not logwood that.	247.72137914040727

Nicely planed.	711.3009653190022
Like the way it curves there.	54.99474248141317

Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	22.340413049830083

No sound.	1432.6351586286457
The sky.	1865.1868048385204
Green by Drumleck.	116.14444244447664
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	284.3169932778216
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	24.649111540024546
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	14.681395527682291
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	20.60516470397259
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	22.835668072001415
Yum.	3279.475308279624
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.	22.17171156389607

She lay still.	1031.8154209395382
A goat.	2298.027198408115
No - one.	303.1392705001233
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	71.85002890012079
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	11.97644451564308
Hot I tongued her.	68.63154182248914
She kissed me.	578.6870486366428
All yielding she tossed my hair.	68.99073724601803

Me. And me now.	72.4455383556174
Stuck, the flies buzzed.	67.73263075336398

Never speaking.	4902.906685286244
I mean to say to fellows like Flynn.	87.06827470591803

Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian.	41.73878332904941
Immortal lovely.	711.3009653190022
And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.	13.795281533930282
They have no.	60.528318424890884
Never looked.	4902.906685286244
I ’ ll look today.	224.36491181565262
Bend down let something fall see if she.	36.460744362930896
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	18.15729194879218
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	11.527841722677534
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	25.507009505116255
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	33.0534307839238
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	132.56810351288712
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	22.764757107629123
Is he in trouble?	65.06432478268286
— Trouble?	8263.997203702196
Nosey Flynn said.	90.5783659012405
Not that I heard of.	90.34766227537672
Why?	3668.761700153618
— Was he?	547.5923370742019
Nosey Flynn said.	90.5783659012405
So he was, faith.	115.72321166977977
I asked him how was all at home.	22.065307055769257
You ’ re right, by God.	96.41588177662763
So he was.	350.3228544819351
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	55.51783293178192
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	37.73625933999656
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	73.63516316044442
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	11.927318441851357
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	53.65857433676363
Plovers on toast.	284.3169932778216
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	74.32916526546207
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	66.56046995568006
You can make bacon of that.	128.05598052825414
— How so?	1511.9319984985564
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	32.13566098068758
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	23.93450408438013
He winked.	3255.4081635959224
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	146.34979907432378
— Do you tell me so?	182.90607771825034
Davy Byrne said.	79.82431284119761
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	154.09980412560728
Ancient free and accepted order.	99.69176780614801
He ’ s an excellent brother.	237.72191360234007
Light, life and love, by God.	29.033504779318996
They give him a leg up.	118.86974719161515
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	48.25222549009768
— Is that a fact?	461.14528589692486
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	84.33017030857137
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	59.05721012973607
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	49.07439271010549
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	24.861547784684007
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	12.393020252544938
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	23.92888105888292
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	72.88271680176442
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	14.740372821420438
Decent quiet man he is.	83.67617978478319
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	20.640341515742954
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	87.14196746708696
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	45.42570298685798
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	33.95125127894325
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	128.67599693212932
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	13.272972341120015
Declare to God he does.	64.41582805787725
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	114.79851332728455
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	78.79897280946551
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	46.738398906657366
Give the devil his due.	71.22474753067969
O, Bloom has his good points.	88.7494947898674
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	38.96551086905274
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	36.32101005700084
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	256.06648568289944
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	118.15359305618077
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	37.570241495812574
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	21.071851738612907
— Day, Mr Byrne.	295.74295665108735
— Day, gentlemen.	548.6138020235005
They paused at the counter.	219.74994916766755
— Who ’ s standing?	262.42820112837836
Paddy Leonard asked.	78.50919555559246
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	122.02509851689125
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	215.6639440892838
Paddy Leonard asked.	78.50919555559246
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	64.48181987006913
— How much?	880.088536138378
Paddy Leonard cried.	139.9841224210331
Since when, for God ’ sake?	43.89131112449821
What ’ s yours, Tom?	140.1177277781709
— How is the main drainage?	169.1575706156094
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	48.620779089691396
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	25.646365359963443
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	34.8272136277262
he said.	141.38141645313658
— Certainly, sir.	77.24505723546083
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	60.097500879380036
— Lord love a duck, he said.	121.15919031487381
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	14.29376629217046
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	43.262546751109156
A dead snip.	468.0497077068105
— Zinfandel is it?	791.3955546268766
Nosey Flynn asked.	104.04721990907458
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	18.443355022584555
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	90.76125167065378
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	93.81434490536114
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	61.179356921731795
— Is it Zinfandel?	334.9510389187688
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	122.64139243841086
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	53.33076459842403
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	23.990845071109117
Who gave it to you?	250.46153590997235
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	30.425401026887634
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	48.422401785073724
The others turned.	954.3116359862598
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	121.15919031487381
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	17.809775639518772
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	121.15919031487381
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	608.0659831402041
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	20.802822519236333
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	25.06097451835418
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	82.35475023503494
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	21.54398039872783
Surfeit.	3279.475308279624
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	36.460744362930896
First sweet then savoury.	107.79026572423427
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	161.96136515438494
Ruminants.	3279.475308279624
Their upper jaw they move.	70.15078050638779
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	24.500759315287006
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn ’ s mouth.	38.44965616942778
Lean people long mouths.	98.27978219799586
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	15.275419432636674
Course then you ’ d have all the cranks pestering.	25.4531928280093
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M ’ invitasti.	18.859457045033967
Feel better.	221.3568399012299
Burgundy.	3279.475308279624
Good pick me up.	115.89730217705687
Who distilled first?	1032.5646594129869
Some chap in the blues.	46.318519453284466
Dutch courage.	711.3009653190022
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	42.023952108697
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	17.603731045900368
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	12.013742483189166
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	21.631444891394604
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	93.80260945102032
Tonight perhaps.	410.5471886343227
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	19.00964618888349
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	34.394758404388554
That ’ ll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight.	29.877408757884258
Three Hynes owes me.	111.57793483174243
Two eleven.	446.2669766312166
Prescott ’ s dyeworks van over there.	60.151929559078155
If I get Billy Prescott ’ s ad: two fifteen.	56.24729391224086
Five guineas about.	105.19863744517815
On the pig ’ s back.	127.09207554683047
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	17.685458321233387
Today.	831.2657542937562
Not think.	598.7620097582651
Tour the south then.	154.27744248794457
What about English wateringplaces?	180.83241265306356
Brighton, Margate.	284.3169932778216
Piers by moonlight.	284.3169932778216
Her voice floating out.	103.94342474692783
Those lovely seaside girls.	75.67405872813978
Against John Long ’ s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	18.52823927425969
Handy man wants job.	154.27744248794457
Small wages.	361.65629589290785
Will eat anything.	206.99638402533262
Mr Bloom turned at Gray ’ s confectioner ’ s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan ’ s bookstore.	13.723533320738328
_Why I left the church of Rome?	60.151929559078155
Birds ’ <URL> Women run him.	50.40191784567241
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	20.33843690276852
Same bait.	405.0854484338574
No tram in sight.	398.4028579034586
Wants to cross.	21.232989842168312
— Do you want to cross?	138.95781575778273
Mr Bloom asked.	81.84529962123028
The blind stripling did not answer.	103.92149827069512
His wallface frowned weakly.	394.0455867117899
He moved his head uncertainly.	48.905068435006626
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	45.528580556830946
Molesworth street is opposite.	154.27744248794457
Do you want to cross?	67.4877823938138
There ’ s nothing in the way.	40.950394527496414
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	83.2233814680901
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	15.743942710149495
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	49.9657556528346
Horse drooping.	410.5471886343227
Driver in John Long ’ s.	78.35301210780398
Slaking his drouth.	284.3169932778216
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	56.1914574027053
I ’ ll see you across.	192.29409470138725
— Yes, the stripling answered.	258.96134769861413
South Frederick street.	165.49959036625415
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	164.08417406882103
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	23.37892997779533
Say something to him.	104.40415355693833
Better not do the condescending.	49.38819113057679
They mistrust what you tell them.	143.47880384918665
Pass a common remark.	98.27978219799586
— The rain kept off.	270.12345745074316
No answer.	1703.6999238442381
Stains on his coat.	154.27744248794457
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	71.85002890012079
Tastes all different for him.	67.73263075336398
Have to be spoonfed first.	65.65254080265638
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	28.19043807534115
Like Milly ’ s was.	100.54522486849592
Sensitive.	1575.979671522145
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	45.42570298685798
Wonder if he has a name.	39.89848417872901
Van.	1575.979671522145
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	17.993206269944658
That ’ s right.	292.39365843779393
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	15.532295655973497
— Thanks, sir.	493.2727145492226
Knows I ’ m a man.	52.19067823557094
Voice.	3279.475308279624
— Right now?	1251.5185077452627
First turn to the left.	73.31326073334826
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	20.005307039408137
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	19.477788843975173
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	20.554988681776162
Must have felt it.	75.06617016874763
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	46.43560129795657
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	24.160549876251476
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	40.97017389222082
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	17.501094338955088
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	21.00426415294607
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	28.263896839993226
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	31.484440655360793
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	25.873632465943665
Read with their fingers.	99.262726120774
Tune pianos.	711.3009653190022
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	87.88647601318516
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	27.48391512760324
Of course the other senses are more.	31.707681509241986
Embroider.	3279.475308279624
Plait baskets.	711.3009653190022
People ought to help.	73.16422510501177
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	42.488081361980015
Hates sewing.	711.3009653190022
Might take an objection.	104.07024705466495
Dark men they call them.	16.703074473839205
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	55.693150474036834
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	47.115627388505324
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	63.61878478329321
Tastes?	1330.846217134227
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	19.92108671279574
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	33.3207587408444
And with a woman, for instance.	70.60940332141278
More shameless not seeing.	100.23815183682414
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	29.15806770554158
Look at me.	153.36882015109938
I have them all on.	218.8139370075373
Must be strange not to see her.	45.92838772241701
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	23.746035734057767
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	18.01542890615175
His hands on her hair, for instance.	70.53551833340579
Say it was black, for instance.	31.782387588417947
Good.	452.94603954592435
We call it black.	431.00459687264413
Then passing over her white skin.	151.15088486026846
Different feel perhaps.	165.49959036625415
Feeling of white.	284.3169932778216
Postoffice.	1330.846217134227
Fag today.	711.3009653190022
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	13.505142450111185
Accept my little present.	106.94871078683059
Stationer ’ s just here too.	71.85002890012079
Wait.	365.9458717894147
Think over it.	142.55177471040543
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	23.973195309885618
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	47.01678465067058
Downy hair there too.	154.27744248794457
Not smooth enough.	247.72137914040727
The belly is the smoothest.	236.75172691695573
No - one about.	162.74284991830942
There he goes into Frederick street.	56.02367512056147
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	34.431863148625865
Might be settling my braces.	60.11756612409401
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	11.135283339570375
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	51.08984161841797
Want to try in the dark to see.	35.85923005032319
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	54.73898341468132
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	58.214877474958286
Terrible.	1274.0642762518826
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	81.23686769253887
Life a dream for him.	66.79628478691298
Where is the justice being born that way?	72.61255917240048
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	16.431586239318538
Holocaust.	3279.475308279624
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	19.190710251248987
Dear, dear, dear.	54.13603453185858
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	18.34803560682642
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	28.52872933473371
Solemn as Troy.	183.1684056623006
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	46.016699040482564
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	51.48399123502332
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	26.898613627813717
I sentenced him to ten years.	147.46268464768747
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	24.475391240931437
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	28.263896839993226
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	23.51968154458482
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	26.417894824319646
Sends them to the rightabout.	99.69176780614801
The devil on moneylenders.	269.5899428311887
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	54.58606516877998
Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	43.14069620773401
Power those judges have.	98.27978219799586
Crusty old topers in wigs.	99.69176780614801
Bear with a sore paw.	64.41582805787725
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	64.05362856427487
Hello, placard.	168.84649321281512
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	151.30882595280832
Sixteenth.	3279.475308279624
Today it is.	222.49609012726305
In aid of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital.	76.10369964378692
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	39.11847483439242
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
Handel.	3279.475308279624
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	61.91335662179005
No use sticking to him like a leech.	24.63273582631174
Wear out my welcome.	154.27744248794457
Sure to know someone on the gate.	40.676744105437585
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	56.612656962982406
First I must.	104.84978294644881
Library.	3279.475308279624
Straw hat in sunlight.	154.27744248794457
Tan shoes.	711.3009653190022
Turnedup trousers.	711.3009653190022
It is.	153.8332739506918
It is.	153.8332739506918
His heart quopped softly.	394.0455867117899
To the right.	81.95219218805022
Museum.	3279.475308279624
Goddesses.	3279.475308279624
He swerved to the right.	237.74840479189962
Is it?	261.268297028228
Almost certain.	350.02061860370287
Wine in my face.	125.76758908023898
Why did I?	2991.876920830588
Too heady.	4356.383081816867
Yes, it is.	475.1439193903363
The walk.	3231.5631710819375
Not see.	598.7620097582651
Get on.	429.2007706736068
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	23.27774426770354
Handsome building.	361.65629589290785
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	61.88097701523744
Not following me?	247.72137914040727
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	60.31778969181792
Light in his eyes.	73.16422510501177
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	58.71607913351107
Quick.	375.31812689577913
Cold statues: quiet there.	49.78915073502049
Safe in a minute.	65.71085748492969
No. Didn ’ t see me.	81.32336064353383
After two.	462.9767359333333
Just at the gate.	141.4726443751868
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	18.013739795693283
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	30.2903952308487
Look for something I.	146.42481655146102
Where did I?	124.81838468823463
Busy looking.	711.3009653190022
He thrust back quick Agendath.	173.66933671006979
Afternoon she said.	183.1684056623006
I am looking for that.	607.2039171886554
Yes, that.	3685.1437981541176
Try all pockets.	181.32531720953463
Handker.	3279.475308279624
Trousers.	1330.846217134227
Potato.	1575.979671522145
Purse.	3279.475308279624
Where?	3823.0177472484206
Hurry.	831.2657542937562
Walk quietly.	222.84695499185113
Moment more.	410.5471886343227
My heart.	219.43869141728035
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	16.711757431033373
Ah soap there I yes.	103.17048120812687
Gate.	3279.475308279624
Safe! Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred: — And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	13.955745346937311
A great poet on a great brother poet.	72.61433484527782
A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.	18.947835585449113

He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	23.37892997779533
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	17.29080460526137
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	12.004569463483634
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	29.834501417584114

France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer ’ s Phæacians.	13.114035486478107
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	28.43018193875286
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	27.203030708288892
The one about <URL> He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui - même_, don ’ t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	16.13002094680603

_Hamlet ou_...	106.94871078683059
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	120.92166578202324
John Eglinton laughed.	121.52303730093561
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	69.0718243461783
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	22.17171156389607
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	71.85002890012079
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	37.24843192362083
Not for nothing was he a butcher ’ s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	15.247637683679496

— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	31.42900688890665
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	21.37362524344396
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	18.75720667064191
If thou didst ever...	79.75244981030482
— What is a ghost?	313.59567108900455
Stephen said with tingling energy.	254.2089976378924
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	19.34705979049419
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	22.835668072001415

— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	27.42805665481007
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	22.01474201722828

A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	16.934550089408344
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	10.611068780879553
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	13.409957875014436
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	14.304382356123703
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	8.801084050977549
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	30.384994488419807
Art thou there, truepenny?	67.73263075336398
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	165.65170223267376
I mean, we have the plays.	77.26455464701857
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	22.924694894073763
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	15.18950225782142
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	18.04402260616583
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	49.78274944282415

John Eglinton ’ s carping voice asked.	48.45431300596792
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	30.998741013385388
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	42.62439043404075
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	40.5616108188738
She saw him into and out of the world.	69.07909524420315
She took his first embraces.	51.49346607577541
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	20.38453516245373

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	23.482340399808788
— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	20.0838584262164
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	244.9036900782978
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	68.81096032209844
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	53.477793757542244
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	18.15729194879218
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	25.366468738645573
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	81.23686769253887
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	31.933825815660704
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	14.728858997174815
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	18.849420894597063
Mr Best ’ s quiet voice said forgetfully.	30.38034466270902
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	50.00741357317996
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	14.682039121204848
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	32.11724350210398
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	11.238257729596455
That memory, _Venus and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light - of - love in London.	16.5066051404801
Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured?	106.61647607752603

Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal?	11.20527584206129

He was chosen, it seems to me.	169.8283421005251
If others have their will Ann hath a way.	38.94789383372811
By cock, she was to blame.	51.49086531161521
She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix.	19.866851645552988
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	13.791191074010603
And my turn?	556.9197402181511

Come! — Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	19.542320432438054
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	19.93189597606518

Is Piper back?	312.34449433697574
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	11.010282365464946

— They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest.	23.2040395412557
Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses.	19.091483685641915
We are all looking forward anxiously.	89.73789634434652
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	21.346692336730378
See this.	4808.144566744617

Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	99.69176780614801
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	54.58606516877998
Did you hear Miss Mitchell ’ s joke about Moore and Martyn?	22.973469017153107
That Moore is Martyn ’ s wild oats?	47.42304995352019
Awfully clever, isn ’ t it?	55.73304468410233
Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.	22.857353369084507

— O, yes.	470.09612504667365
If he considers it important it will go in.	31.53172479427188
We have so much correspondence.	149.6071121278698

Stephen sat down.	1141.2559906879392
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	77.31638168023375
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	21.346692336730378
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	13.100160617856199
Alarmed face asks me.	154.27744248794457
Why did he come?	272.0823690530255
Courtesy or an inward light?	99.69176780614801
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	34.32415464215387
— Yes.	1687.0603916768166
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	38.44965616942778
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters ’ wives.	13.639392820356711
Fox and geese.	284.3169932778216
And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	12.068245567475968
— Yes.	1687.0603916768166
So you think...	182.94689526630987
The door closed behind the outgoer.	79.8349183266511
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	19.904035737903623
A vestal ’ s lamp.	194.84482612077056
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	10.838011698904259
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	24.649111540024546
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	33.46196676388118
And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest.	53.08319747005722
_In painted chambers loaded with <URL> They are still.	34.394758404388554
Once quick in the brains of men.	38.67136704386034
Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	13.404469674555308
— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	18.746638794345582
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	52.655315597318165
Not even so much.	87.61895682633295
Others abide our question.	154.27744248794457
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	93.79034352900702
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	52.72916181567693
Mr Best pleaded.	171.84272476043589
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	21.548536262517132
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	30.134187987409803
His private papers in the original.	145.16435036620675
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	71.85002890012079
Taim in mo shagart_.	154.27744248794457
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	41.06049749179847
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	11.46855609098829
Bear with me.	154.26572091933093
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	44.18697515122635
A basilisk.	2298.027198408115
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	31.484440655360793
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	40.95046369527936
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	14.782731530340126
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	10.683048068335582
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	12.705935779423866
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	14.946691259971809
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	45.42570298685798
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	244.17531340196305
I feel Hamlet quite young.	167.78800741547144
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	26.206139885859656
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	33.46235196160271
He is in my father.	665.1704378971257
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	65.44921172589378
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	34.73135072576448
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	50.13017385068675
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	29.248585204602996
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	76.83096537564077
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	63.54457679699389
Said that.	410.5471886343227
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	12.413407435749438
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	18.37569746836558
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	16.27991787939776
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	37.24843192362083
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	25.73754550590092
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	55.42059883550668
Good Bacon: gone musty.	78.01483747130429
Shakespeare Bacon ’ s wild oats.	16.412535436955
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	154.27744248794457
Seekers on the great quest.	99.69176780614801
What town, good masters?	228.72009114248254
Mummed in names: A.	99.69176780614801
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n - og_.	22.77175732414464
Booted the twain and staved.	99.69176780614801
How many miles to Dublin?	65.35417054970084
Three score and ten, sir.	56.348695093051646
Will we be there by candlelight?	58.9219227557458
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	35.37443351547616
— Does he?	2022.6103650516063
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	12.3234328853576
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	29.980864514629104
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	29.465885626914513
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	13.5028520609765
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	44.27732732386227
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	38.44965616942778
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	23.395214811852718
Do you know what you are talking about?	26.132077373756072
Such an appeal will touch him.	51.83088826991584
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	47.39778885945854
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	47.39778885945854
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	44.19550272609863
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	29.815812873781574
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	43.62316795256754
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	45.86194647189441
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	19.05511760278557
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	55.42059883550668
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	17.239698249739853
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	83.46847464911093
Dost love, Miriam?	92.68823457328038
Dost love thy man?	92.68823457328038
— That may be too, Stephen said.	116.84509191725232
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	17.299028968448486
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	14.655573845688133
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	28.516046827396405
Why?	3668.761700153618
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	16.920900353049372
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	54.58606516877998
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	80.26268160388507
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	36.906007916342965
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	18.358164219117157
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	11.303470929289766
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	33.698849530545374
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	40.21963935001698
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	24.231916516319554
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	14.282044798961424
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	16.303000737094717
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	17.933311372380686
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	13.578766269755551
His beaver is up.	394.0455867117899
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	10.766355267824375
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	97.24790096409383
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	36.460744362930896
_Entr ’ acte_.	284.3169932778216
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	16.058485666169727
My telegram.	431.58920446298544
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	39.750883901761846
he asked of Stephen.	154.1072371926544
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	26.898613627813717
They make him welcome.	268.9407556140432
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	19.05511760278557
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	9.360356059551444
He lifts his hands.	294.81093433184697
Veils fall.	711.3009653190022
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	47.45965110040911
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	105.04252544169307
A most instructive discussion.	233.7276350233247
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	16.784361982703757
All sides of life should be represented.	53.718663391104336
He smiled on all sides equally.	38.52873046779706
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	89.7479041342478
he said.	141.38141645313658
I seem to know the name.	147.46268464768747
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	58.89699035871132
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	82.70753693059243
The chap that writes like Synge.	153.14632269331
Mr Best turned to him.	69.57692792303773
— Haines missed you, he said.	130.57526804550332
Did you meet him?	106.77297809392597
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	42.97623055140601
B.	354.71935377199077
C.	417.9052384715969
He ’ s gone to Gill ’ s to buy Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	30.69796291114105
— I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	132.01582113219328
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	23.010178013554288
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	45.42570298685798
Has no - one made him out to be an Irishman?	25.746057820851767
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	27.3370821427436
— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	22.828244052840944
<URL> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	18.022294128560794
— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	90.44451382385633
the quaker librarian asked.	82.62216172680085
Or Hughie Wills?	1064.249869459199
Mr William Himself.	302.51801005871334

— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	44.04779656584112
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	12.60419298619737
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	23.853625771470007
The light touch.	954.3116359862598
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	35.86731647962427
Tame essence of Wilde.	154.27744248794457
You ’ re darned witty.	201.88552060813768
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy ’ s ducats.	23.410978336343042
How much did I spend?	65.35417054970084
O, a few shillings.	181.48540967816953
For a plump of pressmen.	65.25590276538153
Humour wet and dry.	106.94871078683059
Wit.	3279.475308279624
You would give your five wits for youth ’ s proud livery he pranks in.	27.185236867388703
Lineaments of gratified desire.	154.27744248794457
Take her for me.	90.81814414306858
In pairing time.	1024.9621948498984
Jove, a cool ruttime send them.	55.693150474036834
Yea, turtledove her.	106.94871078683059
Eve.	3279.475308279624
Naked wheatbellied sin.	183.1684056623006
A snake coils her, fang in ’ s kiss.	49.467358366014
— Do you think it is only a paradox?	80.7954606978289
the quaker librarian was asking.	58.3709977523315
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	47.39778885945854
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	78.99330727712422
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	21.86115185762635
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	20.734037505153612
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	64.1247332659709
— Telegram! he said.	404.8637341755854
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	10.23973821087009
Where did you launch it from?	47.81756891075913
The kips?	3231.5631710819375
No. College Green.	269.7824906466636
Have you drunk the four quid?	175.6776391344952
Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	29.75046079761603
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	11.989019848606777
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	14.597967923422328
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	19.019347080386716
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	12.844442665338882
Stephen laughed.	4041.370935041488
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	41.232812167689204
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	54.28045519837451
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	42.97480637403001
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	137.48136367650127
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	295.74295665108735
That was your contribution to literature.	173.1045863576441
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	43.748217947720775
— Murder you! he laughed.	244.9036900782978
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	15.114749729883131
In words of words for words, palabras.	86.24902049213554
Oisin with Patrick.	284.3169932778216
Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle.	33.46196676388118
_C ’ est vendredi saint! _ Murthering Irish.	38.44965616942778
His image, wandering, he met.	104.06335192720522
I mine.	2996.151545654079
I met a fool i ’ the forest.	71.42752324464435
— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	44.2727801884816
—...	120.20160324537322
in which everyone can find his own.	37.49960206727927
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	25.065256367052054
Yes?	9912.005901071161
What is it?	244.41975128248578
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	35.66562335446406
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	15.721558098977791
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	61.387091309458455
Is the gentleman?...	53.452307786538796
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	14.493452710219563
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	32.600160046358276
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	16.638183815509123
— This gentleman?	1582.8209664383894
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	55.693150474036834
Good day, sir.	130.09032319518965
_Kilkenny_...	284.3169932778216
We have certainly...	149.6071121278698
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	129.14506950814115
— All the leading provincial...	87.36474056002808
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, _ <NUM>...	24.649111540024546
Will you please?...	41.3330092625636

This way...	142.7532155638229
Please, sir...	71.54182551037574
The door closed.	336.5335128115116
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	130.60262277095475
He jumped up and snatched the card.	109.4915174924078
— What ’ s his name?	252.19966522816762
Bloom.	3062.7862855312187
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	33.400405100033744
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	29.94154518983878
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	55.42059883550668
Every day we must do homage to her.	30.567290235974628
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	19.76311134424449
He knows your old fellow.	97.09954870329223
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	29.636888104115283
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	64.1247332659709
Venus Kallipyge.	350.02061860370287
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	25.86848239346999
— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	37.584192962949075
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	84.14132365747945
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	14.771889415661336
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	15.483826927205305
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	11.168616215473923
His life was rich.	394.0455867117899
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	21.573123710285643
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	13.393893447496376
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	13.254780692868746
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	36.906007916342965
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	13.161737454723317
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	9.964083152840521
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	11.76922307141148
Cours la Reine.	284.3169932778216
_Encore vingt sous.	183.1684056623006
Minette?	3279.475308279624
Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	33.46196676388118
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	24.404787586045362
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	17.671410521216906
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	30.837560604493987
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	22.607363630219382
Do and do.	269.10456962653404
Thing done.	361.65629589290785
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	26.860838318933965
An azured harebell like her veins.	167.27507064270895
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	45.42570298685798
He walks.	1878.9496072483732
One life is all.	84.90736943839039
One body.	290.41418875103454
Do. But do.	91.01279116948383
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	21.346692336730378
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	76.78080526437533
— Whom do you suspect?	404.8637341755854
he challenged.	739.2722818985632
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	51.385572921839085
Once spurned twice spurned.	89.26558162626948
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	30.40681269073027
Love that dare not speak its name.	36.703815477218384
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	24.340000919434214
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	51.48399123502332
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	18.48571367629539
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	16.312128064122998
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	34.10180750364015
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	12.431968381396398
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	19.97421636324862
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	38.67136704386034
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	35.87439495768039
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	34.32817570853136
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	10.454914770185077
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	8.81904879123877
O, yes, mention there is.	65.5199089700989
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	16.0930222929339
Explain you then.	161.2259711689697
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	23.918659947043174
He faced their silence.	398.08316491768073
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	55.75223087669065
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	36.028802588787876
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	64.1247332659709
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	10.052138352415191
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	54.77716558877715
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	13.972212963127022
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	15.933710949785858
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	15.86156454192808
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	20.439981961644463
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	38.0146508239559
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	53.42996768649055
Let me think.	5096.425644290519
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	10.850412850147206
— Do you mean he died so?	149.07661023919417
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	39.84850175690373
I mean...	406.500640856238
— He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	91.37138195710763
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	49.467358366014
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! — What?	29.636888104115283
asked Besteglinton.	292.1187024185887
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	50.40191784567241
The people ’ s William.	236.75172691695573
Dowden, Highfield house...	54.58606516877998
— Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	129.7511806500045
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	13.959340336409797
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those <URL> Lovely! Catamite.	16.319378163742233
— The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	32.17990578857382
Steadfast John replied severe: — The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	21.346692336730378
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	90.9892042808816
Sayest thou so?	284.3169932778216
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	26.98594234908108
— And the sense of property, Stephen said.	55.56191634932656
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	42.97480637403001
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	16.512998967021737
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	22.721772248958636
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	17.933311372380686
How else could Aubrey ’ s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	27.868854111662845
All events brought grist to his mill.	53.718663391104336
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	10.324650059310004
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love ’ s Labour Lost_.	41.45212755439481
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	32.45863375209889
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter ’ s theory of equivocation.	22.835668072001415
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	20.96180597963838
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’ s.	109.1343468108211
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	10.499582237666964
I think you ’ re getting on very nicely.	45.70435059162327
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	52.567236485280446
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, <URL> — Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	18.249739046693843
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	28.599669758420553
_Sufflaminandus <URL> — He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	16.704999938740684
— A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	84.38431782437581
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	154.27744248794457
_Amplius.	1250.8558942273744
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter <URL> — Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	23.072730047838892
— _Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	47.406483361384524
There he keened a wailing rune.	73.74231251249002
— _Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! _ It ’ s destroyed we are from this day! It ’ s destroyed we are surely! All smiled their smiles.	19.318829326265156
— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	11.99877369055724
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	17.288439448867504
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	19.05511760278557
Accusations are made in anger.	99.69176780614801
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	14.873114662039018
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	21.642484636122585
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.	10.998072029996473
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	21.63792310986745
— Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	97.24790096409383
— Which will?	1177.3520218662663
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	154.27744248794457

Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what ’ s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	13.166774265592373

The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	30.108430508957866
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare ’ s reverence, the angel of the world.	14.07618015403703
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney ’ s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?	16.391288933801597

He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	40.11412351750617
— Why?	8356.138036681898
Stephen answered himself.	1141.2559906879392
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	11.069668793955142
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	12.973264504902712
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	14.99932649311138
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	13.891567392380255
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	15.38874155309783
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	46.14320705024248
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	23.98269120112642
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	12.914647616913767
Age has not withered it.	99.69176780614801
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	12.052882207998678
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	10.008773894766806
He laughed to free his mind from his mind ’ s bondage.	33.84810264084442
Judge Eglinton summed up.	106.94871078683059
— The truth is midway, he affirmed.	91.27119963176808
He is the ghost and the prince.	243.7269242031592
He is all in all.	665.1704378971257

Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen.	18.75720667064191
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	27.482051771451435

O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	53.62743826574424
— And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	72.33598450978124
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?) _ is right.	24.37716094262936
After God Shakespeare has created most.	57.96686757149304
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	63.274407271536816
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	12.072139414514895

And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced.	12.371554543630843
If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa ’ s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	10.140359539362564

The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	9.392162160575802
_ — Eureka! _ Buck Mulligan cried.	31.31709920113199
_Eureka! _ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton ’ s desk.	18.89678224430401
— May I?	1303.0466859240173
he said.	141.38141645313658
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	153.14632269331
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	21.04392922476747
Take some slips from the counter going out.	33.053980932686734
— Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live.	25.093281048231216
The rest shall keep as they are.	109.1343468108211
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	25.1902603751877
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of _The Taming of the <URL> — You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	12.256663316386314
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	32.55522646249809
Do you believe your own theory?	67.22289826833494
— No, Stephen said promptly.	657.4972381173093
— Are you going to write it?	103.34979839788352
Mr Best asked.	110.7079726616183
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	25.665283734967367
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	164.70750617148124
— Well, in that case, he said, I don ’ t see why you should expect payment for it since you don ’ t believe it yourself.	46.84426353931013
Dowden believes there is some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	21.288767513393463
Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	13.375218428393913

But he believes his theory.	147.51981213761616

— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	47.65423536235304
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	11.004791178396419
He broke away.	808.4689138397296
— Come, Kinch.	429.0727601406062
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	39.91699506605024
Come, Kinch.	100.57532929367368
You have eaten all we left.	91.96408611170956
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	26.570675480584807
Stephen rose.	4041.370935041488
Life is many days.	67.03229147364517
This will end.	259.0257741441592
— We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	76.86784987805204
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	38.44965616942778
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	118.6813608567436
— Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	48.37625346914023
I ’ ll be there.	203.1779370300063

His lub back: I followed.	145.16435036620675

Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	14.484262119272314
What have I learned?	380.5031874825104

Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won ’ t you wed a wife?	13.545640432024774
He spluttered to the air: — O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	25.737465742392015
We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers ’ hall.	31.953125497293705

M ’ Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	13.321422281065157
Jest on.	711.3009653190022
Know thyself.	313.05872378838194
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	27.86044346574022
I halt.	2996.151545654079
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	165.65170223267376
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	27.86044346574022
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	31.492513559386996
A laugh tripped over his lips.	129.14506950814115
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	37.33757070742015
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	18.26781474316327
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	29.416562912005823
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	13.830957778360457
One thinks of Homer.	137.48139461469674
He stopped at the stairfoot.	145.76917393935167
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	109.1343468108211
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	30.015202830638263
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	12.019923671978047
But listen.	2827.5478951875466
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	9.337531373373555
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	9.89933620060168
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	17.520582479068842
Part.	2179.400143858039
The moment is now.	293.36956372985276
Where then?	4103.048991415154
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	30.000432559673133
Why?	3668.761700153618
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	24.220948902041155
My will: his will that fronts me.	37.19705243368989
Seas between.	711.3009653190022
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	39.21419807876439
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	97.48805114345444
The portico.	3231.5631710819375
Here I watched the birds for augury.	44.67488434304109

— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	39.24846454891777
Did you see his eye?	49.40732131269598
He looked upon you to lust after you.	66.41813839801259
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	147.46268464768747

A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	17.79593475469842
They followed.	1442.1738961257072
Speak on.	361.65629589290785
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	27.39598376398532
No birds.	2951.7761514224244
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	16.11036383964698
Cease to strive.	284.3169932778216

J.	244.1848863975607
reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	21.346692336730378
Five to three.	163.2910445837477
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	52.567236485280446
What was that boy ’ s name again?	52.110825508386114
Dignam.	438.70280385028553
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
_Vere dignum et iustum <URL> Brother Swan was the person to see.	26.898613627813717
Mr Cunningham ’ s letter.	104.20970506649277
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
Oblige him, if possible.	99.69176780614801
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	38.261694037104895
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	24.391193860038317
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	17.363200293340864
J.	244.1848863975607
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	15.185121545157006
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	55.47040607215104
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	9.55082611728757
And you, father?	48.482027837004544
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	49.82509524250746
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	43.83323251188457
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	36.68459978801689
Was that so?	690.5271283967093
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	24.125428164326
And Mr Sheehy himself?	270.1638640847611
Still in London.	254.8035708449388
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	67.21387770102423
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	43.62316795256754
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	34.66925981909888
O, yes: a very great success.	65.50766700193347
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	10.887375214207422
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	246.59398067439972
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	14.168629081292973
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	34.73255433067312
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	13.146318029688764
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	77.54004355584625
A zealous man, however.	194.84482612077056
Really he was.	183.1684056623006
And really did great good in his way.	79.20866256232009
Beyond a doubt.	165.49959036625415
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	50.94468060254187
Of good family too would one think it?	43.649309730384886
Welsh, were they not?	99.69176780614801
O, lest he forget.	181.48540967816953
That letter to father provincial.	106.0122835931772
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	32.70805953299256
The little house.	954.3116359862598
Aha.	601.8685280762263
And were they good boys at school?	80.91300642975833
O.	2428.4693463862277
That was very good now.	272.329972917808
And what was his name?	157.382153584786
Jack Sohan.	350.02061860370287
And his name?	327.04721410776096
Ger.	3279.475308279624
Gallaher.	1575.979671522145
And the other little man?	143.61158052020923
His name was Brunny Lynam.	143.8993762357487
O, that was a very nice name to have.	50.31950026469991
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	14.699660191865703
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	32.744520456373905
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	54.32085822044621
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	58.29229413509207
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	13.7993686315307
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	22.48752273165936
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	10.696092296974102
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	98.48008433059712
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	16.99160901983364
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	119.274970541855
A fine carriage she had.	194.84482612077056
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	45.69757598889191
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	24.404787586045362
what should he say?...	43.62316795256754
such a queenly mien.	154.27744248794457
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	15.370918808437578
The reverend T.	78.24961105625871
R.	368.9488546279293
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	42.488081361980015
The incumbent they called him.	236.75172691695573
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	40.284667426455734
But one should be charitable.	149.0347055089859
Invincible ignorance.	711.3009653190022
They acted according to their lights.	143.47880384918665
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	24.473630335795608
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	17.032749630434473
Surely, there ought to be.	78.35301210780398
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	58.89699035871132
All raised untidy caps.	101.31194943227621
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	36.93253987258448
Christian brother boys.	284.3169932778216
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	25.371470201315613
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	42.612989189062034
For aged and virtuous females.	96.04641417451343
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	31.854590224538278
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	45.42570298685798
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	27.24787470858207
And now it was an office or something.	59.46727879467237
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	13.25889753614763
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	15.75000948347952
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	19.33636365510314
In America those things were continually happening.	113.55165512604025
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	36.460744362930896
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	39.287316348062
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	16.372116857276133
They saluted him and were saluted.	143.47880384918665
Father Conmee passed H.	109.26514039962625
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	17.48186859363486
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	30.61534538700688
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	16.520643735920665
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	11.231651763707985
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	10.90790297940734
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	69.48168545859585
J.	244.1848863975607
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	10.401363581409509
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	20.816245749193936
C.	417.9052384715969
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	10.43395717909015
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	19.515597608578855
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	10.94032028012453
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	13.846797835863265
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	25.14860185933551
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	74.17225221698446
It was a peaceful day.	49.247911887295764
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	34.81512103937378
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	103.50975742453873
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	28.607843617923983
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	17.51394316561031
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	36.93253987258448
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	14.538808562102151
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	18.336742024683108
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	47.39778885945854
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	10.01449200178371
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	18.349938063903306
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	15.180422333099406
J.	244.1848863975607
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	9.969534543389093
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	15.452857052256288
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	12.727011559861893
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	36.57246653870386
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	14.663414580829253
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	19.678461797248524
The Malahide road was quiet.	236.75172691695573
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	44.499454079473
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	109.1343468108211
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	19.87135240601565
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	26.061822944379713
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	15.21669912485879
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	10.315151900652287
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	14.327567224641125
Who could know the truth?	182.9559649451419
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	12.964733815265895
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	29.111006211409215
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	21.446644113323273
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	11.705965744959972
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	33.33562464217599
He was humane and honoured there.	371.0059394595221
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	19.602494995911144
It was a charming day.	49.247911887295764
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	24.576663712419766
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	26.78187191814417
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	71.85002890012079
A just and homely word.	194.84482612077056
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	16.606963579722038
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	45.86194647189441
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	16.029930113291943
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	126.88328057819761
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	23.20176273565768
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	118.03962143118123
Nones.	3279.475308279624
He should have read that before lunch.	109.4915174924078
But lady Maxwell had come.	219.35562064258886
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	23.20176273565768
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	9.764425868668985
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	14.721962735439417
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	18.54480188754621
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	11.47957438205171
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	19.080272128867605
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	22.235056512370488
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	16.863660959230515
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	29.350840721102085
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	16.010450536662006
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	19.39206203598637
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	49.21108965017736
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	608.0659831402041
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	65.59393195056509
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	12.524722770832755
— What ’ s the best news?	112.75515652616718
he asked.	136.3611024919681
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	51.19615528473842
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	18.913871372014786
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	21.228288204952474
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	19.391739449505973
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	17.79593475469842
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	12.170166394192982
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	32.687453836176054
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	14.855769391545406
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	12.871753367395362
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	79.98846563634328
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	21.731846235944744
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	15.983819887142833
It fell on the path.	96.80056808317529
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	14.254013978273367
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	21.124379088888848
— Did you put in the books?	99.72391274777077
Boody asked.	21.690473733250403
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	14.771889415661336
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	49.5970263353935
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	17.92823973041311
— Where did you try?	290.5038631107188
Boody asked.	21.690473733250403
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	186.05878092647762
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	12.69690401411406
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	63.10061801610324
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	30.212357566372525
— What ’ s in the pot?	248.7819812250123
she asked.	573.8877874192854
— Shirts, Maggy said.	404.8637341755854
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	11.432852095289713
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	15.610809328784185
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	129.14506950814115
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	404.8637341755854
Katey asked.	523.5436006047171
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	165.65170223267376
The lacquey rang his bell.	35.57418414340081
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	27.503747098760144
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	24.160549876251476
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	12.13876688440296
Where ’ s Dilly?	1741.9567507527506
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	121.15919031487381
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	9.825844544292117
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	9.38197551275595
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	15.244551039136592
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	18.058210106353904
— Put these in first, will you?	97.24790096409383
he said.	141.38141645313658
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	72.66211239796311
And the fruit on top.	162.35351629637253
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	44.404842076937854
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	28.760797076738186
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	12.449833571591682
H.	368.781480841293
E.	349.8337578232202
L.	370.6794578529804
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	15.277726624616662
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	24.02437082488391
— Can you send them by tram?	117.9444083111755
Now?	12243.68271664493
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	29.300426857071088
— Certainly, sir.	77.24505723546083
Is it in the city?	56.24797691311191
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	76.25337573215532
Ten minutes.	4723.844749360552
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	52.13283316471092
— Will you write the address, sir?	71.76868325962457
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	21.953556608438472
— Send it at once, will you?	121.15919031487381
he said.	141.38141645313658
It ’ s for an invalid.	71.90670491154346
— Yes, sir.	317.3803834839747
I will, sir.	164.36984846468633
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	29.634250881937508
— What ’ s the damage?	253.54809240685483
he asked.	136.3611024919681
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	44.23358014745609
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	25.892618431599985
A young pullet.	422.9006340718793
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	51.40312751587981
he asked gallantly.	283.94063040887727
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	19.451626047996093
— Yes, sir, she said.	135.00155250552788
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	33.46196676388118
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	13.708446257961441
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	58.14154210525781
he asked roguishly.	283.94063040887727
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	21.508545623015277
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	39.010143590457496
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	19.12904381728023
Palefaces.	1575.979671522145
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	12.335635753042313
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	26.51901773676072
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	26.09202032194299
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	33.46196676388118
È peccato.	711.3009653190022
Perchè la sua voce...	71.85002890012079
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	55.693150474036834
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	22.34845186140683
_Ma, dia retta a me.	54.58606516877998
Ci rifletta_.	711.3009653190022
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	14.172842703727689
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	54.455749453416736
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	54.29228815718039
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	60.833826090891556
Human eyes.	361.65629589290785
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	39.936006996817696
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	29.99659739293418
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	71.85002890012079
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	18.12245331987704
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	27.911642503545607
_Scusi, eh?	284.3169932778216
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	18.927071445297454
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	11.12692870916355
Too much mystery business in it.	116.58678773525128
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	24.008724876387607
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	30.06571936269872
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	27.179830178081904
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	30.567981900705703
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny ’ s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone ’ s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	13.777881423259101
E.	349.8337578232202
L.	370.6794578529804
Y. ’ S and plodded back as they had come.	22.809767733554153
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	16.146733912021983
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	99.69176780614801
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	65.87917872578622
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	35.56808331780291
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	40.97017389222082
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	25.85772887151093
They kick out grand.	387.956915531319
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	28.263896839993226
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	26.2951866608308
— Hello.	8195.984934194064
Yes, sir.	993.1893581417909
No, sir.	278.6444415624925
Yes, sir.	993.1893581417909
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	60.02462844007136
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	27.8669917667085
All right, sir.	101.31194943227621
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	26.926261065125853
A quarter after.	726.5144068847064
Yes, sir.	993.1893581417909
Twentyseven and six.	284.3169932778216
I ’ ll tell him.	144.9285356883861
Yes: one, seven, six.	27.669690644760067
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	113.9728319569121
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	28.930223155608257
Mr Lenehan, yes.	162.4648616970753
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	32.17601230433164
No, sir.	278.6444415624925
Yes, sir.	993.1893581417909
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	60.02462844007136
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	17.52058247906885
— Who ’ s that?	289.7442249581248
Ned Lambert asked.	83.74905733738183
Is that Crotty?	141.43093820527153
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	63.274407271536816
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	75.73212777745984
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	18.919067784441303
Come on.	168.3115807900176
Mind your steps there.	96.16032387952906
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	21.99714625508073
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	29.283062011861986
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	56.57445836828853
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	146.00058559149167
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	18.21915668475387
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	23.982662527506445
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	14.328169365357502
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	45.05562411334612
— No, Ned.	1823.7271718655209
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	29.228453003046813
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	142.7088866852691
That ’ s quite right, sir.	43.67089425790441
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	21.56455275850863
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	61.57363741973307
Bring the camera whenever you like.	39.137487389988074
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	50.10637507612993
You can take it from here or from here.	58.53535002013813
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	17.77994248347623
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	22.33548831798564
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	69.39360230303645
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	50.09220448267193
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	50.71355190191057
Drop in whenever you like.	61.12338231827737
Next week, say.	96.16032387952906
Can you see?	124.62593149599265
— Yes, yes.	531.2800667189169
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	56.987911607838164
Very pleased to have met you.	43.78960741949859
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	96.8725667190081
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	24.948715648731763
With J.	3505.4385636417223
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	15.753769792726832
He stood to read the card in his hand.	54.58522107781123
— The reverend Hugh C.	197.31851293119456
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	38.44965616942778
Nice young chap he is.	48.908582737607674
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	66.29819255114582
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	99.24636891284904
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	28.351833086986055
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	77.24844535368081
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Molloy said.	225.0055124649451
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	37.530383941411586
— God! he cried.	206.97514646669285
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	19.761453580690933
You know that one?	225.58789023531017
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	13.365012697085508
What?	2342.5114089148965
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	72.1873471421749
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	47.789759649520114
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	23.645470433076724
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	55.42059883550668
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	22.731601436445334
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	55.96883468571437
What is it?	244.41975128248578
What ’ s the trouble?	184.5087094376699
Wait awhile.	430.5209671677293
Hold hard.	143.74899586920517
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	24.979794944506956
— Chow! he said.	404.8637341755854
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	25.121786637262968
J.	244.1848863975607
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	77.52472374066458
cold night before...	99.69176780614801
blast your soul...	99.69176780614801
night before last...	99.69176780614801
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	28.21848857379157
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	38.06438860560424
— I was...	631.707092044274
Glasnevin this morning...	99.69176780614801
poor little...	154.27744248794457
what do you call him...	54.61656104978066
Chow!...	154.27744248794457
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	9.897064260801496
— See?	245.14343414857308
he said.	141.38141645313658
Say it ’ s turn six.	38.226080718385255
In here, see.	311.36018607079944
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	10.177960793037233
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	20.656393046193223
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	10.169771687978313
— See?	245.14343414857308
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	32.093876165782014
The impact.	3231.5631710819375
Leverage, see?	284.3169932778216
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	47.505126779801266
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	94.64318868975289
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	26.754832599970698
— See?	245.14343414857308
Tom Rochford said.	143.52470808068628
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	19.93189597606518
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	12.105188455734512
One good turn deserves another.	90.31336208659901
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	174.41003187317978
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	71.31091673646993
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	233.83221697394035
When you two begin...	92.46883584565317
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	26.436853327732276
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	75.57660930885133
he asked.	136.3611024919681
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	404.8637341755854
See you later.	1311.4209370320868
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	62.226558758239435
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	122.95230788650248
The drain, you mean.	236.75172691695573
— Drain?	8263.997203702196
Lenehan said.	170.81047429059427
It was down a manhole.	90.23893265752098
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	17.592505828296698
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	14.32669631972603
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	12.128410973462511
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	14.742426587056354
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	23.976544252344315
— The act of a hero, he said.	77.22226801364934
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	21.85698045844617
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	97.20026401753944
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	24.429029390871346
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	43.895071418277034
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	15.578587729964303
— After three, he said.	181.08189919616953
Who ’ s riding her?	157.8615329877104
— O.	7867.78510259539
Madden, Lenehan said.	18.576259561640633
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	12.026649770384672
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	10.22957616547887
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	29.059019458714822
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	165.65170223267376
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	19.804370517392428
Through here.	405.38990835213895
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	44.38380928860317
— There he is, Lenehan said.	91.81627937421747
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	58.294563589880084
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	47.406483361384524
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	80.4361095396755
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	26.04686508147051
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	14.796847867309006
Astronomy it was about.	154.27744248794457
Lenehan laughed.	436.2030805483221
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	41.80362701055881
Come over in the sun.	106.37827189981228
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	32.26964010184511
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	15.841415219684563
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	47.60462887294159
The annual dinner, you know.	153.14632269331
Boiled shirt affair.	284.3169932778216
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	19.79792344835126
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	33.75672199691199
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	172.35639163587535
My missus sang there once.	54.73620021800134
— Did she?	1322.7673412054385
Lenehan said.	170.81047429059427
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	35.292607059156815
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	36.97843128844294
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	45.99152500387236
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	24.649111540024546
Bloom and the wife were there.	120.53589250502843
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	17.381480408588143
Fast and furious it was.	99.69176780614801
After liquids came solids.	115.87051695675233
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	27.940517896863163
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	122.95230788650248
The year the missus was there...	66.79888779276757
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	75.38901298232933
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	45.99152500387236
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	11.534492868772269
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	18.55344590304901
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	20.80821905638176
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	33.56842951566475
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	26.2265118169084
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	18.928002841234765
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	16.853756633397754
Like that.	147.84158631784112
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	14.964680467219083
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	22.02656885882716
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	43.048696331911984
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	45.36477728894997
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	14.68469382704322
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	23.724205547698855
He knows them all, faith.	100.78340551516429
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	24.160549876251476
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	39.399257323831385
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	14.558597969389451
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	23.391295578022163
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	200.20545269755124
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	16.176166580049664
Lenehan walked on again.	111.35916973457708
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	42.97480637403001
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	43.86137311988915
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	37.29818219109485
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	61.28928363640572
you know...	106.94871078683059
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	22.345295791502682
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	12.009188572131489
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	21.346692336730378
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	23.3871141132198
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	32.56821997148672
Child born every minute somewhere.	72.82237374211775
Mrs Purefoy.	683.173570017175
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	21.499577928678384
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	103.87456935522462
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	52.13283316471092
— Them are two good ones, he said.	93.80260945102032
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	22.295601098871657
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	17.371973905744923
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	21.161489060215484
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	27.407620119419235
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	99.69176780614801
Know the kind that is.	45.560861139610715
Had it?	445.94438248095537
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
He opened it.	618.4323586038581
Thought so.	141.77888230995404
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	17.63052127556465
Listen: the man.	78.10224717988837
Got her it once.	82.95968040878049
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	20.010837087717302
More in her line.	100.23815183682414
Let us see.	473.596645760016
He read where his finger opened.	38.52873046779706
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	47.432930519422
This.	1070.9623838459052
Here.	397.95024084096895
Try.	1549.6385522814762
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	25.884146260075557
Take this.	321.261502555602
The end.	1865.1868048385204
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	32.543105251785214
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	24.907989988314664
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	34.84302552658982
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	19.349851340559788
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	26.898613627813717
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	145.16435036620675
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	28.263896839993226
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	154.27744248794457
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	38.44965616942778
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	8.864473037736238
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	24.45872421151164
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	24.215952701707174
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	47.505126779801266
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	14.460498130609631
Mr Bloom beheld it.	161.96136515438494
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	29.421762132592246
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	63.495421493963136
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	56.95827510364017
That ’ s a good one.	49.92432858032329
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	9.63965361654035
Four and nine.	116.14444244447664
Those lovely curtains.	120.94177381652626
Five shillings.	355.63364008872605
Cosy curtains.	410.5471886343227
Selling new at two guineas.	67.73263075336398
Any advance on five shillings?	53.58879228020047
Going for five shillings.	98.39170191856822
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	12.116616404213879
J.	244.1848863975607
A.	19938.206404913133
Jackson, W.	183.1684056623006

Munro and H.	284.3169932778216
T.	370.50158055687314
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	22.835668072001415
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	15.791542826986174
He halted near his daughter.	118.7389031581055
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	61.912427435929395
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	35.16326986950603
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	32.92997756071679
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	55.693150474036834
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	52.4905605227621
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	71.04244945501317
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	54.857889180610975
Do you know what you look like?	30.129588927923866
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	22.606929874736924
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	61.22682903392019
All the people are looking at you.	37.69605226869077
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	52.4905605227621
— Did you get any money?	138.37230064438486
Dilly asked.	31.20997052122985
— Where would I get money?	183.17153506495663
Mr Dedalus said.	349.9743668280221
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	21.626665162270786
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	48.54898854871533
— How do you know that?	222.90792798887878
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	148.24069683384155
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	15.905096769182316
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	233.58636738475124
Were you in the Scotch house now?	98.70457763742459
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	23.433282168888134
Here.	397.95024084096895
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	27.44189478261255
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	139.52586433915357
Give me more than that.	65.02021078283205
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	190.3143394693989
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	43.497381129503
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	50.04290138918698
But wait awhile.	499.2087406034055
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	29.47794457833301
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	28.268836056467023
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	23.503428679291822
He ’ s dead.	1421.046462452806
The man upstairs is dead.	177.0008662975593
He left her and walked on.	116.77713455008784
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	13.878830743377025
— Well, what is it?	461.735276353282
he said, stopping.	156.52952942905813
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	22.081807167110416
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	28.44463460907607
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	11.888789107502284
— Watch him, he said.	187.31902868994248
It ’ s instructive.	154.43972457396384
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	51.63798616512364
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	46.596955995614785
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	46.04594072097544
Look, there ’ s all I have.	69.1364879792126
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	22.215386157571018
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	37.054942406125775
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	77.3181909631355
Dilly said.	31.20997052122985
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	286.1590839501044
— I will, he said gravely.	100.0555079098547
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	37.91225985610147
I ’ ll try this one now.	104.66693513571018
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	57.85844436979258
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	59.6582306030681
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	17.830925687735384
I ’ ll be home shortly.	146.09010108448038
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	28.2785016048743
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	31.8747156911807
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	86.47458937449407
The lacquey banged loudly.	66.88328075431924
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	10.483642285107129
Got round him all right.	80.18796066134946
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	34.98287179407456
First rate, sir.	107.79026572423427
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	58.02869113449998
How are things going?	104.97254538875336
Just keeping alive.	256.2399650173204
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	41.73878332904941
Yes, indeed.	2066.7892193485604
Good for the country.	115.89730217705687
Those farmers are always grumbling.	74.11258974435084
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	27.274269182701282
Yes, sir.	993.1893581417909
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	50.40191784567241
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	40.637855059306744
And heartrending scenes.	864.4599239882987
Men trampling down women and children.	15.050361354927675
Most brutal thing.	162.81780811013977
What do they say was the cause?	78.22702094124048
Spontaneous combustion.	711.3009653190022
Most scandalous revelation.	162.81780811013977
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	21.76055612093851
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	24.408369538145614
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	65.22955278175532
You know why?	696.2594334371399
Palm oil.	711.3009653190022
Is that a fact?	86.21584743333779
Without a doubt.	284.3169932778216
Well now, look at that.	75.16728356602782
And America they say is the land of the free.	64.06303975784137
I thought we were bad here.	103.44327247588006
I smiled at him.	278.9432173902844
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	33.46196676388118
_What is it?	183.1684056623006
The sweepings of every country including our own.	83.2233814680901
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	29.4232642547783
Graft, my dear sir.	99.69176780614801
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	17.29778555906853
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	13.682438862675527
Dress does it.	165.49959036625415
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	67.03760322822698
Bowls them over.	284.3169932778216
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	94.78975439729919
How are things?	100.45522319916353
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	34.78167760831305
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	16.836463480780758
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	54.58606516877998
Scott of Dawson street.	154.27744248794457
Never built under three guineas.	300.43127626908455
Fits me down to the ground.	71.85003555785815
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	35.46888554990423
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	14.52494421089796
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	31.484440655360793
Knight of the road.	154.27744248794457
Gentleman.	3279.475308279624
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	18.85749006861759
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	33.33907412522226
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	12.100700307003473
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	30.343532330198972
High colour, of course.	52.60438780561887
Grizzled moustache.	711.3009653190022
Returned Indian officer.	183.1684056623006
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	22.835668072001415
Is that Ned Lambert ’ s brother over the way, Sam?	26.055494828680672
What?	2342.5114089148965
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	158.41857806085326
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	30.95689954160344
Damn like him.	148.3417086374344
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	21.288767513393463
Good drop of gin, that was.	46.023790404020495
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	53.477793757542244
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	26.32567687213603
Greasy black rope.	183.1684056623006
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant ’ s wife drove by in her noddy.	16.395862929897536
Bad times those were.	102.25745404033152
Well, well.	108.01632570005066
Over and done with.	70.16248240662503
Great topers too.	116.14444244447664
Fourbottle men.	711.3009653190022
Let me see.	303.7579633582516
Is he buried in saint Michan ’ s?	33.71336333295804
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	48.287903841144356
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	26.707444882269257
Dignam is there now.	114.0605071920365
Went out in a puff.	72.82237374211775
Well, well.	108.01632570005066
Better turn down here.	109.07705510675777
Make a detour.	105.57101375973436
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	8.890305042045421
Damn dangerous thing.	148.3417086374344
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	30.70484450148628
Runaway horse.	711.3009653190022
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton ’ s office, led his wife over O ’ Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	11.633994870027816
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	56.01738600170398
Times of the troubles.	154.27744248794457
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	27.052805982637075
Gaming at Daly ’ s.	99.69176780614801
No cardsharping then.	887.6195005876992
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	16.71787351025454
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	27.81949070209457
Stables behind Moira house.	154.27744248794457
Damn good gin that was.	62.63907555373349
Fine dashing young nobleman.	68.63154182248914
Good stock, of course.	78.0292259727264
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	22.46359380155992
Course they were on the wrong side.	32.71543636397521
They rose in dark and evil days.	102.98860223816708
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	39.137487389988074
They were gentlemen.	374.78065060715636
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	43.202362009653896
Masterly rendition.	711.3009653190022
_At the siege of Ross did my father <URL> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	13.410562655353356
Frockcoats.	3279.475308279624
Cream sunshades.	410.5471886343227
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	35.57096536600563
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	33.13846432579761
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	12.180813814962535
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	40.637855059306744
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	29.710303590491485
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	14.241217780642751
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	10.100217887119266
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	72.71752965775629
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	24.649111540024546
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	41.2437272428442
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	33.698849530545374
A long and seafed silent rut.	98.11438197467672
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	19.377130628270393
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	13.858973030691804
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	55.693150474036834
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	18.758177298479975

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	11.09206699755547
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	24.576663712419766
Beingless beings.	711.3009653190022
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	20.657554626857195
Your heart you sing of.	55.637412620979475

Shatter them, one and both.	54.58606516877998
But stun myself too in the blow.	102.8448347281606
Shatter me you who can.	72.82237374211775
Bawd and butcher were the words.	71.85002890012079
I say! Not yet awhile.	103.44327247588006
A look around.	726.5144068847064
Yes, quite true.	1304.7043649153102
You say right, sir.	268.9319832222862
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	32.12581798618315
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	29.83464476764366
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	33.46196676388118
The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	36.906007916342965
And they are throbbing: heroes ’ hearts.	48.189832926541385
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	171.51283208860823

Stephen said.	1413.9890712757874
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	33.698849530545374
It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	29.2827196210196
I told her of Paris.	189.51910743145123

_Nebrakada <URL> — What have you there?	55.693150474036834
Stephen asked.	792.1898455895542
— I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.	47.8020761256336
Is it any good?	79.12698932911927
My eyes they say she has.	42.51971812339085

— What did you buy that for?	170.33946433665645
he asked.	136.3611024919681
To learn French?	643.8969300595293
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	69.07909524420315
Show no surprise.	36.476826419110964
Quite natural.	407.3822321073414

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	21.536303908019104
How are things?	100.45522319916353
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	34.78167760831305
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	53.06302408812582
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	25.141420776496
— What ’ s the best news?	112.75515652616718
Mr Dedalus said.	349.9743668280221
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	94.20367783811653
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	21.92103988576018
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	265.06800814994824
Who is it?	646.7696275157191
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	93.79034352900702
— With a broken back, is it?	91.24908492105614
Mr Dedalus asked.	328.9771675937839
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	102.87093137629749
Reuben of that ilk.	133.70618190237417
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	30.3027640708922
All I want is a little time.	42.076597487334254
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	22.729772937521208
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	160.54541699941825
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	19.841705909622565
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	16.5479963250236
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	56.1600654412791
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	12.515986952936561
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	27.43765695958576
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	16.334087683576175
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	109.72279826433814
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	36.616018254372854
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	17.615329939576046
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	18.74311471430367
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	13.191332156292537
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	41.58858483345856
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	28.662882584822206
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	141.8115687768308
Father Cowley asked.	159.78158690584542
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	16.56178930162285
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	16.767570613966267
— Aw! he said.	404.8637341755854
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	66.92344687114797
— What about that?	466.35012289056573
Ben Dollard said.	180.00024163560346
Not too dusty?	159.59204387504397
What?	2342.5114089148965
He turned to both.	255.15606170166788
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	71.4257633632147
The reverend Hugh C.	52.646387049077134
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	15.590003884732495
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	74.09702558038208
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	28.720167875648574
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	94.78241558730724
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	105.7014608699012
Come along.	405.1677679260998
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	29.406318781839573
Wait awhile...	110.38999243337594
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	28.817257723127664
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	60.47643806394417
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	11.2773114320157
— What few days?	825.2255535661549
he boomed.	739.2722818985632
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	36.460744362930896
— He has, Father Cowley said.	118.80164876843216
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	21.43784371046338
The landlord has the prior claim.	116.34866789708371
I gave him all the particulars.	137.96235985279753
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	1235.5882993692317
Love is the name?	119.06755845332485
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	142.42771912354465
The reverend Mr Love.	52.646387049077134
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	94.78241558730724
But are you sure of that?	143.25349723105114
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	22.03769036082757
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	47.505126779801266
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	27.92793242972898
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	15.310442938512457
The policeman touched his forehead.	236.75172691695573
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	85.79502369329991
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	24.612826292208606
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	13.596565767888617
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	109.65698490853124
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	34.67082695050932
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	51.63798616512364
— Boyd?	8263.997203702196
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	91.58515266104055
Touch me not.	104.04721990907458
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	16.63542538129076
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	18.600211591211515
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	66.67026609741337
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	19.85344045772782
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	45.32937595746566
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	75.22357143837232
And put down the five shillings too.	103.30061877438706
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	75.99236903191095
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	121.15919031487381
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	52.93650719619079
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	41.920440850710634
They went down Parliament street.	146.5385101636225
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	53.920434994198324
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	264.91026147013235
Here goes.	364.23746415179505
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	10.310706034061523
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	10.952357169202985
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	26.34568122849904
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	39.00321287385652
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	47.39778885945854
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	17.239062131607398
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	44.87312712356134
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	38.65144518755752
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	29.16299934090439
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	27.224797013468155
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	21.124096387155532
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	93.23602266184784
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	33.32044993210695
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	14.240245416945255
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	14.12258422000547
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	12.379109411502164
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	34.20721749289948
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	20.06620432608287
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	12.897263740089937
— What Dignam was that?	419.65357665192806
long John Fanning asked.	154.27744248794457
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	33.46196676388118
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	76.33607636064409
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	30.808807183325698
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	13.972212963127022
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	24.311519322607392
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	68.67194621490867
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	25.719784498980186
— Rather lowsized.	2022.6103650516063
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	30.617319268319456
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	31.53266431480453
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	55.693150474036834
— What ’ s that?	163.73218576815398
Martin Cunningham said.	85.28482007171361
All turned where they stood.	95.17079221139628
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	52.93650719619079
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	12.959009635789222
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	22.989666103795667
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	48.71783035957622
— What was it?	715.1904788947079
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	21.8838202663233
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	33.49344278689591
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	12.820820827708276
There in the corner.	159.16542797117447
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	19.93420023077655
— Is that he?	1855.2357032687414
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	29.308465522552748
— Yes, Mulligan said.	431.5303014074171
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	26.917528358901645
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	14.893800919721592
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	15.948024159184532
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	51.247426596606836
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	84.87088840295633
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	40.0137449074552
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	19.31506720586365
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	32.600160046358276
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	201.2895747617808
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	10.708581002772089
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	26.206139885859656
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	20.08337471833521
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	65.72947705985483
Wandering Ængus I call him.	99.69176780614801
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	26.154747777837194
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	32.341001376163966
Such persons always have.	99.81244717303377
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	92.96038908602493
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	55.72637358980628
He will never capture the Attic note.	85.76219546386494
That is his tragedy.	64.32791877141875
He can never be a poet.	116.77713455008784
The joy of creation...	116.34866789708383
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	113.32194233537044
I see.	683.1255774428936
I tackled him this morning on belief.	105.52660202594883
There was something on his mind, I saw.	39.24851527389688
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	19.061444943408173
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	21.86115185762635
He helped her to unload her tray.	109.4915174924078
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	25.61277595222012
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	36.906007916342965
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	24.71799175934051
Does he write anything for your movement?	29.372578588420435
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	41.53928854123248
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	31.862884972390848
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	109.4915174924078
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	106.66470790530518
He is going to write something in ten years.	128.6560557499423
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	41.84739784291939
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	19.560451575975264
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	47.505126779801266
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	44.76334206167077
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	76.1125472324665
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	8.818668180081177
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	16.63542687258763
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	8.678242936911529
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	22.235056512370488
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	12.817799651768839
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	14.012559133634404
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	104.06335192720522
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	22.32492075660082
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	11.882884065575176
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	37.33589706539379
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	11.858168368557234
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	10.22948269680294
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	23.47445533459636
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	20.51115725847948
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	25.711045230465817
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	22.71025581406753
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	31.814040031494084
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	35.45974271214218
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	64.03163227343923
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	23.34537881621957
That ’ s me in mourning.	78.44945684171232
When is it?	1125.244079709771
May the twentysecond.	167.48786199574735
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	27.479921539566874
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	19.26862184354317
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	15.793770054203405
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	15.567959977213766
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	23.34537881621957
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	62.670253252813914
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	17.38277448329189
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	17.889622480695394
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	13.710859009618044
No Sandymount tram.	887.6195005876992
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	16.20459910793898
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	44.52562696532035
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	26.206139885859656
He met schoolboys with satchels.	173.66933671006979
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	31.430770217312944
He met other schoolboys.	294.81093433184697
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	36.33341484383595
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	25.382649268063084
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	18.295043303035506
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	18.317510160592644
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	19.256548190528544
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	13.842371800255483
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	52.408840564237366
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	12.034295192161148
Never see him again.	61.21878076787321
Death, that is.	19.19239048147498
Pa is dead.	183.1684056623006
My father is dead.	76.65144333615392
He told me to be a good son to ma.	44.24773323273701
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	17.68570454884988
Poor pa.	466.94688142464145
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	121.68922392504682
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	21.198545112381414
* * * William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge.	12.110468032606315

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.	19.256548190528544
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis.	35.42824120801875
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar.	34.67814268774377

White ’ s, the pawnbroker ’ s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.	10.265386735952974
In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	20.208396930956734
Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King ’ s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty.	10.54094975831844

A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	16.35336088448352
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	9.3335961475132
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	12.624349230559039
The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	59.45132642551024

Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade.	16.164229503390516
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	10.898662696462154
A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	14.60585684353411

Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently.	14.5947278666677
In Fownes ’ s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal ’ s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	16.12722876052755
John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it.	11.235875230055283
Where the foreleg of King Billy ’ s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders.	16.21783375519478

The honourable Gerald Ward A.	172.94128814290227
C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply.	26.41242986089209
At Ponsonby ’ s corner a jaded white flagon H.	58.40826065865187

Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	16.479534799359246
— Is that her?	1855.2357032687414
asked miss Kennedy.	139.51072303843034
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	13.859889462246
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	26.787886711712257
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
Where?	3823.0177472484206
gold asked more eagerly.	154.27744248794457
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	26.713157662274167
He ’ s looking.	1266.0084718170683
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	20.38453516245373
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	62.24235923891621
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	39.67068217379848
With sadness.	3505.4385636417223
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	16.74863031037575
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	26.898613627813717
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	24.160549876251476
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	37.831004483282314
A man.	1144.7984222126547
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	11.418551384153291
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	36.906007916342965
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	64.55902558935983
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	14.282439142849517
— What is it?	290.6756016970602
loud boots unmannerly asked.	154.27744248794457
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	63.274407271536816
— Your _beau, _ is it?	120.8717734292488
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	21.414410544968472
Bloom.	3062.7862855312187
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	26.698755457542635
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	18.28398548362947
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	154.27744248794457
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	107.18059047565947
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	31.62756114881328
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	21.118687859196992
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	16.931466098354196
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	20.410534104570427
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	295.74295665108735
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	104.8391693934798
It gets brown after.	149.07019090684048
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	27.837544622057823
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	140.85913024901961
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	75.78740752751007
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	16.704999938740684
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	17.220995875872518
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	14.094160972263241
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	16.038856851092874
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	361.3826792084976
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	186.97095113390134
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	19.94340717988488
says he.	279.330522431857
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	13.064250844585239
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	41.45212755439481
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	28.760797076738186
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	26.779517079974006
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	22.235056512370488
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	17.151330529989828
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	95.35537253749527
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	34.06849640092797
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	12.61554207520406
Why do I always think Figather?	46.13685932272927
Gathering figs, I think.	99.69176780614801
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	103.30061877438706
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	23.515721744531827
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	45.42570298685798
God they believe she is: or goddess.	44.10237094609166
Those today.	423.36076670773554
I could not see.	189.52379623317015
That fellow spoke.	157.02419418921102
A student.	2298.027198408115
After with Dedalus ’ son.	77.99938281026297
He might be Mulligan.	255.50102320151566
All comely virgins.	266.4311256987857
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	32.73699542938933
By went his eyes.	137.1497553675217
The sweets of sin.	261.36256826831635
Sweet are the sweets.	68.63154182248914
Of sin.	643.7877461696248
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	25.787658834234826
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	16.460060597461894
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	30.559695245535192
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	17.647287928802672
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	8.638900509511602
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	15.505333661410813
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	93.80260945102032
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	11.914369924562811
And then laughed more.	1363.5193520362077
Greasy I knows.	183.1684056623006
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	17.381480408588143
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	20.149916431754903
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	61.641993572180866
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	43.48884456158679
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	75.08096937201427
I feel all wet.	283.19635109466265
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	76.33607636064409
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	29.573702671237466
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	17.52745490993853
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	18.864032630715116
Religion pays.	711.3009653190022
Must see him for that par.	56.814803300366066
Eat first.	232.29930891778383
I want.	3072.513668491187
Not yet.	231.3217960229243
At four, she said.	57.77890413305121
Time ever passing.	196.76346184758702
Clockhands turning.	711.3009653190022
On. Where eat?	284.5260525727188
The Clarence, Dolphin.	423.1963682690693
On. For Raoul.	284.5260525727188
Eat.	737.5594950432064
If I net five guineas with those ads.	97.00385072971197
The violet silk petticoats.	423.1963682690693
Not yet.	231.3217960229243
The sweets of sin.	261.36256826831635
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	45.42570298685798
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	51.232820204380715
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	25.93657067345649
He strolled.	2948.2239449814124
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	96.58790969424085
He held her hand.	287.98117399466395
Enjoyed her holidays?	284.3169932778216
— Tiptop.	4769.796449440028
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	83.46847464911093
— Gorgeous, she said.	404.8637341755854
Lying out on the strand all day.	43.62316795256754
Bronze whiteness.	402.65843966401417
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	27.17189866465892
Tempting poor simple males.	106.94871078683059
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	34.12680828125022
— O go away! she said.	162.0736799745545
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	47.09470478161717
He was.	18965.36600596044
— Well now I am, he mused.	96.52520323147672
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	33.437265741825215
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	59.08306915544919
And what did the doctor order today?	93.90072829000476
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	56.03367839665406
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	19.649041929555317
Jingle.	548.9259526588894
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	72.48189664140742
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	26.958546035477497
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	32.573736264382546
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	24.649111540024546
Alacrity she served.	284.3169932778216
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	83.46847464911093
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	31.138467657128267
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	23.112232699432816
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	18.696069233836464
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	26.246731164872372
Chips.	2463.2158952042796
Shreds.	3279.475308279624
Musing.	3279.475308279624
Mute.	3279.475308279624
None nought said nothing.	144.41282976961872
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	12.969212655708468
In came Lenehan.	660.3217378264005
Round him peered Lenehan.	96.69654188981458
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	103.93282310345633
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	318.1426195845862
To Martha I must write.	244.7005024149968
Buy paper.	523.5436006047171
Daly ’ s.	284.3169932778216
Girl there civil.	175.39223273976515
Bloom.	3062.7862855312187
Old Bloom.	177.2540245689349
Blue bloom is on the rye.	13.682438862675532
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	62.56182786238293
Lenehan came forward.	192.26980325602383
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	121.59326599998639
He asked.	2396.099814995524
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	27.404064820384416
She asked.	1811.5278937773376
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	15.329322367829617
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	32.186143576529
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	115.10558686385083
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	53.77265383391486
To mind her stops.	439.81893424216906
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	42.14224606983563
Jingle jaunty jingle.	111.74663551179793
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	55.693150474036834
Take no notice.	150.53831418342713
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	12.299936178131178
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	14.64178378985531
He droned in vain.	425.27559828986125
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	40.53172960452523
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	20.914205901199278
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	75.78740752751007
— Who may he be?	260.36869346869526
Mr Dedalus asked.	328.9771675937839
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	75.38901298232933
Who?	10733.252455985226
— Who may he be?	260.36869346869526
he asked.	136.3611024919681
Can you ask?	124.62593149599265
Dry.	3279.475308279624
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	18.654025953342696
— I see, he said.	113.97714255816786
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	51.86281893552832
I hear he is keeping very select company.	51.60640616059068
Have you seen him lately?	276.9610970670809
He had.	1463.254247990731
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	73.44197470479038
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	12.130328403709102
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	15.956342050173577
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	14.42444894562852
I see.	683.1255774428936
He see.	3255.4081635959224
He drank.	1019.9027301862495
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	248.0170635519723
Set down his glass.	106.94871078683059
— I see you have moved the piano.	83.68033010698822
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	18.53681168218509
— Is that a fact?	461.14528589692486
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	129.855204921866
The real classical, you know.	153.14632269331
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	61.47604654463959
— Is that a fact?	461.14528589692486
Mr Dedalus said.	349.9743668280221
He drank and strayed away.	122.48726273997825
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	25.833006815161898
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	31.32547427652945
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	27.86044346574022
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	12.626717452885957
Lager for diner.	183.1684056623006
Lager without alacrity she served.	72.82237374211775
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	37.715365999979504
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	14.315315569439836
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	14.303604423542966
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	14.678770187791786
Are you not happy in your home?	30.75325899959228
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	38.44965616942778
Means something, language of flow.	71.85002890012079
Was it a daisy?	56.807539072544394
Innocence that is.	165.49959036625415
Respectable girl meet after mass.	72.82237374211775
Thanks awfully muchly.	203.4168759506166
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	17.299028968448486
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	55.693150474036834
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	96.16032387952906
For some man.	269.8692605656363
For Raoul.	666.410221643759
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	24.948715648731763
It is.	153.8332739506918
Again.	31.243418855229734
Coincidence.	808.5262989580134
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	21.965515045564484
Follow.	1575.979671522145
Risk it.	711.3009653190022
Go quick.	382.07854487047706
At four.	132.90707163481153
Near now.	318.62214531503554
Out.	901.4866287931386
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	74.20931955961639
— Aha...	791.3955546268766
I was forgetting...	624.3994646965716
Excuse...	155.62994706891914
— And four.	7793.944556880125
At four she.	74.30166924287347
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	99.69176780614801
Bloo smi qui go.	125.76758908023898
Ternoon.	3279.475308279624
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	20.895789251669285
For men.	666.410221643759
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	86.24902049213554
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	23.138922386283003
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	16.222378326221246
A call again.	726.5144068847064
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	33.75853059059333
You hear?	4039.000652181499
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	22.543526966454824
Longer in dying call.	154.27744248794457
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	11.918067374426872
— _The bright stars fade_...	129.7511806500045
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	37.60492355445227
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	21.346692336730378
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	11.298844243974925
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	186.05878092647762
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	18.68615472742516
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	74.46213560770342
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	33.15019058257497
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	29.780381529875918
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	97.98102536072285
he asked her.	182.92593761330974
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	27.492004280505707
Like lady, ladylike.	155.81942904373335
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	16.919622685134495
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	123.2092169808763
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	20.207963754435955
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	16.922038003167334
See me he might.	551.550365649457
The seat he sat on: warm.	109.1343468108211
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	15.678334401853135
— _And I from thee_...	165.65170223267376
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	115.54541118980266
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	35.502735827421866
She smiled on him.	451.64973660569086
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	23.92888105888292
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	98.27978219799586
— What ’ s your cry?	228.75079316272246
Glass of bitter?	143.3409013821524
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	22.861067694651155
Not yet.	231.3217960229243
At four she.	74.30166924287347
Who said four?	1032.5646594129869
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	11.780200457207798
Avoid.	3279.475308279624
Goulding a chance.	262.6436071948146
What is he doing in the Ormond?	79.13116088220357
Car waiting.	410.5471886343227
Wait.	365.9458717894147
Hello.	377.16781877608435
Where off to?	1155.1688287336422
Something to eat?	105.95171583376383
I too was just.	376.6569888688484
In here.	2039.3622177147872
What, Ormond?	344.01028953571085
Best value in Dublin.	91.83494879654869
Is that so?	141.43093820527153
Diningroom.	3279.475308279624
Sit tight there.	100.26305128398326
See, not be seen.	201.85536547754623
I think I ’ ll join you.	59.42132897655433
Come on.	168.3115807900176
Richie led on.	167.48786199574735
Bloom followed bag.	1009.8530360024711
Dinner fit for a prince.	72.82237374211775
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	13.16362688819127
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	50.43885980707153
— Why don ’ t you grow?	377.9925737717758
asked Blazes Boylan.	78.24369255381008
That is to say she.	47.10079248847117
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	99.69176780614801
He pitched a broad coin down.	153.71030072150984
Coin rang.	345.2276592150924
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	51.28460937545341
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	63.10061801610324
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	75.78740752751007
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	104.85324146903527
Not on my own, you know.	40.408537263559325
Fancy of a friend of mine.	55.86978659912605
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	13.299438435172029
Idolores.	3279.475308279624
The eastern seas.	954.3116359862598
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	15.988315016781884
Clock clacked.	274.7993595600028
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	21.92862175668784
It clanged.	675.5942791397385
Clock clacked.	274.7993595600028
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	16.973094948692264
Look to the west.	101.50508787829176
A clack.	2298.027198408115
For me.	338.8318926247562
— What time is that?	463.33511335710335
asked Blazes Boylan.	78.24369255381008
Four?	737.5594950432064
O ’ clock.	852.3274758400836
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	16.714480468827496
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	64.94390363114941
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	48.33368503117103
Be near.	243.30848100575685
At four.	132.90707163481153
Has he forgotten?	105.93360357835114
Perhaps a trick.	163.35053109842082
Not come: whet appetite.	90.34766227537672
I couldn ’ t do.	174.70573935040792
Wait, wait.	171.91030189024949
Pat, waiter, waited.	51.1818707634352
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	29.75046079761603
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	48.34708304816402
There ’ s no - one.	42.76746205988551
He never heard.	558.7770535431399
—...	120.20160324537322
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	19.05511760278557
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	22.475165050417623
— Please, please.	791.3955546268766
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	109.4915174924078
— _I could not leave thee_...	121.15919031487381
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	165.65170223267376
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	368.97023197871675
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	23.17988457070584
She looked.	1753.24505946266
Quick.	375.31812689577913
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	104.8391693934798
Sudden bent.	711.3009653190022
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	56.91118432821268
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	15.58389379722583
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	16.356517662899538
Delayed.	3279.475308279624
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	29.75046079761603
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	45.136386320480845
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	24.46172704394909
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	129.855204921866
Trained by owner.	154.26572091933093
No sawdust there.	887.6195005876992
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	19.559637415451494
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	40.770856478476574
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	72.82237374211775
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	16.704999938740684
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	12.08529980963847
Yes, bronze from anearby.	453.95832970822994
—...	120.20160324537322
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	29.409609842028008
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	46.256422559888065
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	59.83341550714601
I wanted to tell you.	145.56731998944244
Tom Rochford...	87.27817226138853
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	98.60123065955459
Lenehan gulped to go.	111.35916973457708
— Got the horn or what?	244.9036900782978
he said.	141.38141645313658
Wait.	365.9458717894147
I ’ m coming.	682.7008016669292
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	82.68781119272974
— Eh?	4010.904735824013
How do?	394.6683821484742
How do?	394.6683821484742
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	14.866245244648631
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	49.006972579290085
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	45.42570298685798
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	27.24818352070891
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	24.649111540024546
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	75.78740752751007
Come on, Simon.	77.13315139993337
Give us a ditty.	64.5455506728848
We heard the piano.	431.00459687264413
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	23.873504551304844
Power for Richie.	165.49959036625415
And Bloom?	847.3502140024773
Let me see.	303.7579633582516
Not make him walk twice.	90.34766227537672
His corns.	2903.4841098907514
Four now.	232.29930891778383
How warm this black is.	107.01329292553896
Course nerves a bit.	89.26558162626948
Refracts (is it?) heat.	60.151929559078155
Let me see.	303.7579633582516
Cider.	1575.979671522145
Yes, bottle of cider.	621.4561002804185
— What ’ s that?	163.73218576815398
Mr Dedalus said.	349.9743668280221
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	104.42734411186656
Begone dull care.	284.3169932778216
Come, Bob.	156.1146700999513
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	21.689976985909915
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	109.4915174924078
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	154.27744248794457
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	26.6027597950088
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	55.693150474036834
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	24.992656409869472
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	102.201124256748
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	85.61095384966251
He ’ s off.	1266.0084718170683
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	21.084026287220095
Jingling.	1274.0642762518826
He ’ s gone.	699.4777779374303
Jingle.	548.9259526588894
Hear.	1274.0642762518826
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	66.51837073059514
God be with old times.	95.5689558991067
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	19.14118190345388
Gone.	371.13860926029577
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	15.58389379722583
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	10.441756559242776
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	18.954297772340002
There was.	752.6845837994035
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	59.10073197011157
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	80.7983743924097
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	58.74012967885203
— God, do you remember?	136.15339838796314
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	33.32027219648011
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	72.69124617529295
They laughed all three.	387.956915531319
He had no wed.	249.54374847456674
All trio laughed.	266.4311256987857
No wedding garment.	887.6195005876992
— Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	21.482993091703065
Where ’ s my pipe, by the way?	143.0441551497123
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	47.505126779801266
Bald Pat carried two diners ’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	20.65294050172101
And Father Cowley laughed again.	161.14744939241754
— I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	130.98763712136653
— You did, averred Ben Dollard.	157.68688378026982
I remember those tight trousers too.	95.78296307654576
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	30.325167956443206
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	34.05364569508007
He saved the situa.	294.81093433184697
Tight trou.	211.0500139360508

I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.	16.846280560165603
— Lo, Joe, says I.	165.7043676441445
How are you blowing?	83.96529044211591
Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	17.540757778087848
— Soot ’ s luck, says Joe.	121.15919031487381
Who ’ s the old ballocks you were talking to?	49.1095992672819
— Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	71.6135180143908
— What are you doing round those parts?	87.95876341821901
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Devil a much, says I.	165.65170223267376
There ’ s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane — old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him — lifted any God ’ s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop - of - my - thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.	9.364210998544076
— Circumcised?	8263.997203702196
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Ay, says I.	474.0087613921705
A bit off the top.	132.38156923351988
An old plumber named Geraghty.	43.87628758903537
I ’ m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can ’ t get a penny out of him.	21.987144983587672
— That the lay you ’ re on now?	96.66446235824776
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Ay, says I.	474.0087613921705
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts.	21.777214962948342
But that ’ s the most notorious bloody robber you ’ d meet in a day ’ s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.	15.297352674550819
_Tell him, _ says he, _I dare him, _ says he, _and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, _ says he, _I ’ ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a <URL> And he after stuffing himself till he ’ s fit to burst.	10.19072036836518
Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out.	15.976065529903757
_He drink me my teas.	88.18344478206103
He eat me my sugars.	237.74840479189962
Because he no pay me my moneys? _ For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of <NUM> Saint Kevin ’ s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	10.737166913680413
Geraghty, esquire, of <NUM> Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	8.156165900010896
— Are you a strict <URL>.?	102.71840821949023
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	67.86902878808506
— What about paying our respects to our friend?	85.84807756466722
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
says I.	154.622238962144
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	20.49884904514917
— Drinking his own stuff?	404.8637341755854
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Ay, says I.	474.0087613921705
Whisky and water on the brain.	71.85002890012079
— Come around to Barney Kiernan ’ s, says Joe.	123.51404495855662
I want to see the citizen.	119.72064517339332
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	75.78740752751007
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	54.58606516877998
— Not a word, says Joe.	111.53746668342215
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	104.71572508610704
— What was that, Joe?	172.45320078136209
says I.	154.622238962144
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	62.670266903942434
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	35.48890390383351
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	21.582735488468632
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	18.178499628488357
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	20.97726329001031
For trading without a licence, says he.	47.432930519422
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	41.23946684427467
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	46.28384636287484
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	19.24373712732239
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	9.999819218705333
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	10.988874338498917
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	9.505895328739076
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	11.173316665754975
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	10.670538455193213
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	8.528729051890219
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	51.89773001438097
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	7.853681462846103
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	12.43812206929563
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	17.37866088134136
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	27.540660522523634
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	15.889101513223524
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	13.927554686990561
— Stand and deliver, says he.	150.5781443197301
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	121.37401617779685
Friends here.	711.3009653190022
— Pass, friends, says he.	165.65170223267376
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	26.177188558159337
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	25.540413053875824
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	40.64105676292349
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	46.24391618214196
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	20.387323230021124
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	23.038701613896446
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	47.41552591219151
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	32.460235892889905
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	51.258200466895865
— Wine of the country, says he.	121.15919031487381
— What ’ s yours?	488.28414796203396
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	244.9036900782978
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	91.43854295913819
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	55.58805230572065
says he.	279.330522431857
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	73.17868608529206
What Garry?	3042.1608973833618
Are we going to win?	72.29121296877334
Eh?	373.70694353851286
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	17.359753753805172
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	15.570455043573281
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	10.641828927760242
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	15.20002819919338
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	19.056907739345665
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	10.949935070437654
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	13.498690772764947
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	22.17171156389607
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	15.004062159332756
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	8.210396245893795
Fursa, S.	284.3169932778216
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn ’ t, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	9.26864845857497
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.	11.010916958256768
Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O ’ Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O ’ Sullivan Beare.	7.637459934994324
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	10.520130095857139
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	17.33920562802902
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	56.99604888624075
A goodlooking sovereign.	726.5144068847064
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	65.94898278877868
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	97.24790096409383
says I.	154.622238962144
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	121.15919031487381
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	33.734158078381846
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	20.294287169167607
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	42.635441823134315
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	43.062279130407724
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	22.835668072001415
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	33.978616242351855
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	66.67026609741337
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	52.193340573320825
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	13.906099395819226
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	14.191318551538
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	12.023491888359983
How ’ s that, eh?	59.34129752601176
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	10.789708116372278
Eh?	373.70694353851286
Deaths.	3279.475308279624
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	13.114035486478107
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	110.9743906406069
— Cockburn.	8263.997203702196
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	12.501816308847815
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	12.214001545678403
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	47.101226113658136
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	25.065268679831618
Drink that, citizen.	73.16422510501177
— I will, says he, honourable person.	69.76709869911977
— Health, Joe, says I.	165.7043676441445
And all down the form.	148.2395151479228
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	19.95163180985009
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	16.964531386373466
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	10.055673137444575
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	12.99653235684361
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	18.154992331438486
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	24.48691053952397
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	12.588952015030515
I thought Alf would split.	151.1977606701432
— Look at him, says he.	64.58776243163453
Breen.	3279.475308279624
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	44.87104501923409
p: up on it to take a li...	29.728424584009442
And he doubled up.	271.6422886449102
— Take a what?	447.23216890266156
says I.	154.622238962144
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	91.99889034769741
— O hell! says I.	238.96070602412553
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	14.763923928769684
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	62.53695746959633
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Breen, says Alf.	404.8637341755854
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	13.286275851712965
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	102.92611255656746
U.	368.0643244858494
p: up.	76.68283706886689
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	15.555250719048326
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	46.329482940510864
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	103.65483854417259
Is that Alf Bergan?	86.21584743333779
— Yes, says Alf.	217.36290198896953
Hanging?	1274.0642762518826
Wait till I show you.	41.455541127805034
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	44.24727016593238
You should have seen long John ’ s eye.	72.30269238296204
U.	368.0643244858494
p....	129.11389455194384
— Who are you laughing at?	149.49512227818065
says Bob Doran.	134.60302315201895
Is that Bergan?	141.43093820527153
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	76.81011964228925
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	10.564028739014386
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	9.84997608514064
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	12.13164164949308
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	13.547757431216153
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	8.633297017139999
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	39.193691123624305
— What ’ s that?	163.73218576815398
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	48.08046216324064
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	27.535886702366078
Hangmen ’ s letters.	154.27744248794457
Look at here.	86.01591727065731
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	27.72196347044398
— Are you codding?	557.4411821895302
says I.	154.622238962144
— Honest injun, says Alf.	244.9036900782978
Read them.	367.0954903924655
So Joe took up the letters.	122.21780374774188
— Who are you laughing at?	149.49512227818065
says Bob Doran.	134.60302315201895
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	20.73815059179558
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	12.443600738232284
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	272.00861943677603
Only I was running after that...	36.471028256908205
— You what?	1850.9369713367441
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	58.6245663825032
With who?	3505.4385636417223
— With Dignam, says Alf.	171.79694784239172
— Is it Paddy?	334.9510389187688
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Yes, says Alf.	217.36290198896953
Why?	3668.761700153618
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	105.24708707404668
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	129.7511806500045
— Ay, says Joe.	540.0191369401122
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	25.157461658422726
— Who ’ s dead?	289.7442249581248
says Bob Doran.	134.60302315201895
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	45.4126474654072
— What?	1708.7588479661683
says Alf.	154.622238962144
Good Christ, only five...	46.023790404020495
What?...	249.8492874411852
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	27.465595121140858
What?	2342.5114089148965
Dignam dead?	452.1709938731798
— What about Dignam?	672.7271767389515
says Bob Doran.	134.60302315201895
Who ’ s talking about...?	62.66623024104318
— Dead! says Alf.	295.74295665108735
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	129.08550199579054
— Maybe so, says Joe.	244.9036900782978
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	53.06302408812582
— Paddy?	4769.796449440028
says Alf.	154.622238962144
— Ay, says Joe.	540.0191369401122
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	43.64768319963164
— Good Christ! says Alf.	187.3429322907207
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	39.077658232509094
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	10.713033111238605
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	14.315315569439836
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	11.543785802627939
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	12.43042787003183
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	9.926262586103578
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	11.784509867926175
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	10.547492011165286
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	11.564117629574215
Mind C.	350.02061860370287
K.	357.16045865450025
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	15.58389379722583
J.	244.1848863975607
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	15.00599210378061
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	9.668781039695242
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	17.933311372380686
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	17.381480408588143
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	46.63772794555053
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	24.649111540024546
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	19.05511760278557
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	68.88907892641244
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
— Bloom, says he.	223.89312449509535
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	44.86789235104971
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	19.770317460099633
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	61.033052758080125
Faith, he was.	106.94871078683059
— Good Christ! says he.	187.3429322907207
I could have sworn it was him.	60.381201563743524
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	14.303002045725655
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	187.5167831639268
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	41.05618977209062
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	37.571670990747656
He ’ s over all his troubles.	226.58156561836006
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	102.8448347281606
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	25.44651026988438
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	14.129498831279857
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	26.481667585010506
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	45.84267427869791
Talking through his bloody hat.	83.67617978478319
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	9.574885168139195
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	72.50637442941812
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	35.538548058596476
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	27.381151587420447
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	20.634727706187633
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	51.24964016118439
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	20.95000391640463
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	37.06367914623337
Listen to this, will you?	43.121888404900034
And he starts reading out one.	81.72756199668981
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	10.403926770310829
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... _ — Jesus, says I.	15.286243535342148
— _...	791.3955546268766
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	23.89503283387275
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	15.767865163962771
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	17.52859936399114
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	40.62382361037073
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	22.653815699123065
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	22.691071478626718
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	37.96636604641161
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	22.251295346718855
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	18.774306105751453
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	12.01152683688072
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	32.31098929451567
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	11.281669876754371
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	13.645020443925825
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	43.46435631776336
— What ’ s that?	163.73218576815398
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	32.17990578857382
— That so?	879.0028989959808
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	81.186886654701
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	19.761453580690933
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	18.085257074159625
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	51.588129302018785
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	73.5318475568157
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	18.403067807503973
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	31.276682112456857
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	8.377514973715769
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	16.621910914550377
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	22.835668072001415
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	20.516002823695864
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	15.820861470620786
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	16.518812119789306
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	25.603086096271394
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	11.585040238178276
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	21.675439784155234
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	15.116395258525236
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	9.34454890873114
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	17.35702306617991
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	23.41910103861893
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	11.592225652271866
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	21.16590799393643
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	108.67202892191735
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	78.09307048919284
What I mean is...	113.19890704816326
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	121.15919031487381
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	16.704999938740684
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	51.189177634066965
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	14.571324437829299
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	14.906299048835544
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	10.87121329623457
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	11.351913469095187
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	10.263851757783067
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	10.89869853312366
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	12.161279555592031
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	10.266382140256999
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	9.504581955953885
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	12.895797757974949
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	34.84302552658982
O.	2428.4693463862277
T.	370.50158055687314
E.	349.8337578232202
I.	2508.1631099906976
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	15.604566554940774
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	12.962090427164403
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	14.045060605661954
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	30.479185418005407
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	34.394758404388554
O.	2428.4693463862277
T.	370.50158055687314
E.	349.8337578232202
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	53.04456526707501
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	10.258696031879232
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	15.555250719048326
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	13.720076241878177
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	15.569551961089484
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	9.661228870401395
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	51.54077684707793
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	11.549644549712774
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	11.452494907388346
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	11.421541985968572
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	10.027601232227799
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	9.726383269773445
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	18.547239887643524
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	8.329497974436194
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	12.195912407387807
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	28.143685879298417
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	12.873810406574316
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	11.38963286356364
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	11.177469826286154
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	29.53627116711057
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	13.099889782687349
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	10.853493640946946
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	9.09182853520442
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	8.224279529744713
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	11.382533018925802
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	10.040863114986859
Antitreating is about the size of it.	55.693150474036834
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	10.867128963285984
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	9.2383208542608
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	61.54002214511295
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	23.23287193128027
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	11.553471139952286
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	20.112174100404047
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	25.877859940951243
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	17.694691840470554
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	129.7511806500045
says the citizen, jeering.	138.2443280758752
— No, says I.	755.957557188149
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	49.339626564182154
So he calls the old dog over.	84.47543242121277
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	132.64835257278966
says he.	279.330522431857
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	14.267745314513556
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	24.333724789769587
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	11.484639802924779
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	15.58389379722583
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	9.03484888085136
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	15.895866356395384
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	9.77169844925188
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	11.85517281246645
O.	2428.4693463862277
C.	417.9052384715969
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	10.748328011042615
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	12.867901661515534
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	13.158357511239444
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	11.171664471263304
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	13.158357511239444
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	17.314461546725433
And Joe asked him would he have another.	79.20866256232009
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	27.55977391032547
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	23.635628401011623
Entertainment for man and beast.	99.69176780614801
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	24.501225365722338
— Could a swim duck?	404.8637341755854
says I.	154.622238962144
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	97.46239490084353
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	39.03291572341014
says he.	279.330522431857
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	86.20950454494735
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	15.509391145616934
Martin asked me to go to the house.	48.00446916379168
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	10.663987002764713
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	59.26777072367372
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	54.03253841424689
— Whose admirers?	1303.0466859240173
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	43.90263556898795
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	21.70154199417275
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	25.993938194491
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	32.600160046358276
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	11.349441791305114
Choking with bloody foolery.	154.27744248794457
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	40.240067661907354
Shake hands, brother.	92.68823457328038
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	46.07954935803618
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	11.750685417746787
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	17.1744462902672
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	13.352243572796542
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	43.53802224940433
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	11.9402586137283
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	44.2806388297871
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	78.35301210780398
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	15.427099041050425
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	11.830073364809513
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	11.433985665481854
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	13.281117500901829
_How is your testament?	154.27744248794457
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	28.81932884677504
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	11.914718712732316
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	73.39839628353828
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	34.32662437286178
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	44.65465768608425
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	17.137497779713136
So Terry brought the three pints.	175.4318254526436
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	81.92181772253011
Here, citizen.	151.05104463199095
— _Slan leat_, says he.	244.9036900782978
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	129.79243225940922
Good health, citizen.	115.89730217705687
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	26.674193896082745
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	29.58683355286399
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	44.05176654282465
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	165.65170223267376
— Nannan?	4769.796449440028
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
The mimber?	3231.5631710819375
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	107.53383043027942
— I thought so, says Joe.	254.37909327063682
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	26.120882777505
P., the cattle traders.	98.15119093850278
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	24.755057590206874
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	11.193598940652182
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	21.488581576676445
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	10.734131713171452
Mister Knowall.	711.3009653190022
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	55.693150474036834
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	12.379493527081017
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	13.274003228765775
What ’ s your programme today?	124.51223222495301
Ay. Humane methods.	97.2757737999957
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	11.375294139532231
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	21.35837175811224
Klook Klook Klook.	21.696452012205963
Black Liz is our hen.	52.59468761573086
She lays eggs for us.	250.3317101578399
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	56.1871517199636
Gara.	3279.475308279624
Klook Klook Klook.	21.696452012205963
Then comes good uncle Leo.	233.22955268237112
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	35.502735827421866
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	99.69176780614801
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	52.33049908878659
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	48.923054318692934
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	72.99816819345817
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	177.04578366202352
I wanted particularly.	829.803260538718
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	50.81600631144255
I couldn ’ t phone.	174.70573935040792
No. You ’ re sure?	109.25981073985034
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	76.81011964228925
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	23.42786461208138
What do you think of that, citizen?	47.70630144699621
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	52.65727014586159
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	76.12261530625591
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	10.234378704620466
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	162.4648616970753
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	16.603269197474056
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	43.85093225783403
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	31.8747156911807
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	57.64652449884222
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	13.53906449290451
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	14.409250560317444
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	32.70309694747164
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	162.4648616970753
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	43.29675953443446
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	28.08611041281601
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	26.547866807754623
There he is sitting there.	63.39577028705605
The man that got away James Stephens.	83.78941936581163
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	47.39778885945854
What was your best throw, citizen?	87.62177695150929
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	67.23324783224335
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	19.850724659163784
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	76.81012481854168
You were and a bloody sight better.	82.80664349159807
— Is that really a fact?	463.9801961977134
says Alf.	154.622238962144
— Yes, says Bloom.	217.36290198896953
Did you not know that?	72.71979767276952
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	13.723411105068944
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	18.19787036795352
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	15.57814086028778
Do you see that straw?	67.4877823938138
That ’ s a straw_.	93.16237738012104
Declare to my aunt he ’ d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	16.685120628532378
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	10.385737504753555
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	24.576663712419766
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	9.684695373309964
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	10.79082066056317
L.	370.6794578529804
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	9.203368666579868
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	14.22041380220427
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	11.507036560369281

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	31.51223478299105
— No, says Joe.	755.957557188149
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	44.19550272609863
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
Blazes?	3261.778520155987
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	18.520669276883435
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	371.7640164958322
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	19.36217609689704
— We know him, says the citizen.	104.05444114211906
The traitor ’ s son.	236.75172691695573
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	52.655315597318165
— True for you, says Joe.	118.6542598875464
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	16.532107819516348
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	33.46196676388118
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	33.532222975993314
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	16.85212770534598
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	14.392260414801719
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	12.153164920446565
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	15.793770054203405
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	47.39778885945854
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	12.4805202039851
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	13.445271902805969
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	21.99714625508073
The men came to handigrips.	172.94128814290227
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	13.5028520609765
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	12.835861137345455
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	17.73677191107636
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	46.14320705024248
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	21.99714625508073
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	9.640488424656473
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	9.985540103352092
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	55.795088701108085
— He is, says Joe.	165.70436352864525
Isn ’ t he?	80.90752378334447
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
says Bloom.	279.330522431857
Ah, yes.	81.61484996719068
That ’ s quite true.	72.92482511194193
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	88.7982481231729
Just a holiday.	101.25337573080182
— Mrs B.	1303.0466859240173
is the bright particular star, isn ’ t she?	48.51877395186729
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— My wife?	734.5865524284848
says Bloom.	279.330522431857
She ’ s singing, yes.	112.85528221178119
I think it will be a success too.	52.47092741456574
He ’ s an excellent man to organise.	118.30837065656696

What ’ ll it be, Ned?	114.4481559435588

J.	244.1848863975607

says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Yes, says J.	179.72090347007338
He ’ ll square that, Ned, says he.	35.82490635585336

With his name in Stubbs ’ s.	83.77312504467551
Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.	13.972212963127022
Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no - one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop.	13.158488532566544
What ’ s your name, sir?	71.11653665672135
Dunne, says he.	154.27744248794457
Ay, and done says I.	36.101431998890995
Gob, he ’ ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I ’ m thinking.	18.36035919615
— Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?	54.87637807860878
says Alf.	154.622238962144
U.	368.0643244858494

Looking for a private detective.	50.772695029708046
— Ay, says Ned.	816.2212580701464
And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	16.743487842507122
— Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	87.54294518378632
God, I ’ d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	16.824117798306276
— Was it you did it, Alf?	91.72730228619042
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	23.342773830815112
— Me?	4769.796449440028
says Alf.	154.622238962144
Don ’ t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	31.185393021957005
— Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	38.32522682081164
— Of course an action would lie, says J.	59.32628024881912
J.	244.1848863975607
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	44.499454079473
U.	368.0643244858494
p: up.	76.68283706886689
_ — Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	24.544339868071805
Do you know that he ’ s balmy?	33.49908515314702
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	16.975341671669806
— Yes, says J.	179.72090347007338
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	12.69269125157612
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	97.24790096409383
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	35.675611296195086
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	128.80422036664731
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	70.0577935184432
— How half and half?	328.88000418717354
says Bloom.	279.330522431857
Do you mean he...	73.30709716654015
— Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	33.59042339322755
A fellow that ’ s neither fish nor flesh.	46.05451803339079
— Nor good red herring, says Joe.	121.15919031487381
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	63.03643306847132
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	47.115627388505324
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	15.54398926950151
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	12.917146345776553
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’ s was pewopener to the pope.	15.319708197056775
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’ s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	11.12926803482505
And who was he, tell us?	73.5502877139782
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	16.004500284157338
— And moreover, says J.	569.0474822203356
J., a postcard is publication.	33.778456315103114
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	21.861760498885058
Hole.	3279.475308279624
In my opinion an action might lie.	80.84905012194824
Six and eightpence, please.	51.92616866966121
Who wants your opinion?	451.92301940532735
Let us drink our pints in peace.	73.94624397560823
Gob, we won ’ t be let even do that much itself.	25.521919908222166
— Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	138.9181446641813
— Good health, Ned, says J.	130.5717052157679
J.	244.1848863975607
— - There he is again, says Joe.	99.90363336202603
— Where?	4622.910375380264
says Alf.	154.622238962144
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	11.506369055333817
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	71.67032336417903
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Remanded, says J.	404.8637341755854
J.	244.1848863975607
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	11.137766788398027
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	24.113482115334346
Course it was a bloody barney.	47.66648782989828
What?	2342.5114089148965
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	17.381480408588143
J.	244.1848863975607
J.	244.1848863975607
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	12.72357589861462
— Who tried the case?	393.5387618840384
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Recorder, says Ned.	404.8637341755854
— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	30.314245816321172
— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	80.29396129256479
— Ay, says Alf.	816.2212580701464
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	11.979547709840963
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	14.90838813494335
Ten, did you say?	294.11149126616846
— Yes, your worship.	431.5303014074171
And my wife has the typhoid.	109.37563023999905
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	25.177261567181738
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	65.95500643068848
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	14.435136401084069
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	10.985749871499287
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	9.148936436353885
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	26.702623266580424
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	12.600484130838167
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	11.897404999316027
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	10.911771103318225
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	14.668124053097113
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	17.041383411255875
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	15.619871383247578
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	28.971523054352076
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	12.93368497993256
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	18.90659620729798
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	33.90582686581776
That ’ s the whole secret.	49.10970540665134
— Rely on me, says Joe.	165.65170223267376
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	58.93720973925988
We want no more strangers in our house.	84.14132365747945
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	31.44330447466521
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	31.506570380503803
— Consider that done, says Joe.	165.65170223267376
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	90.44451382385633
— The strangers, says the citizen.	129.4286701469002
Our own fault.	180.23193508959253
We let them come in.	240.49100882463858
We brought them in.	431.00459687264413
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	55.42059883550668
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	165.65170223267376
J.	244.1848863975607
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	11.269035358338169
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	44.80197846215905
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	24.56176202924022

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	16.85681625675588
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	18.747508690957424
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	38.68036874795847
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	39.76046578731631
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	9.227766382057988
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	63.163081672179864
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	41.6469980480673
J.	244.1848863975607
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	9.865605561914544
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	84.4943481886006
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	13.000718390331619
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	29.416562912005823

I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	39.84284106801275
You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	13.181877499625536
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	9.334805399107225
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	77.19929795128269
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	28.4590984763461
— Gold cup, says he.	244.9036900782978
— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	238.89889314901222
says Terry.	389.6236827603937
_ — Throwaway, _ says he, at twenty to one.	25.635086599999468

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	13.80930248373207
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	8.077476258888304
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	10.386044778004212
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	11.691969095431558
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	11.289303590376493
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	12.969091346973887
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	21.739852634529427
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	111.42802915429604
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	11.044249051421104
— And will again, says Joe.	395.9851199864313
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	42.560270205014746
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	9.130629277588302
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	11.73821915580448

What will you have?	253.36606036930485
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	58.63200908018343
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	26.61134151522098
Terry! Are you asleep?	72.82237374211775
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	105.48507585393573
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	51.232820204380715

— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	28.00336477707016
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	69.45551078011297
Hell upon earth it is.	49.78915073502049
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	14.911975737596295
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	55.401231194535605
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	10.749631785574826
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	17.39119101233189
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	19.861844901918225
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	12.549196307029757
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	54.63801201894152
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	15.281643447257384
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	18.879214142064196
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	63.10061801610324
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	37.129470731026245
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	236.75172691695573
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	9.622891669097427
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	70.20472292487797
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	31.87928625027093
Didn ’ t I tell you?	41.73878332904941
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	14.730484570117783
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	44.555243107192574
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	48.442950921871386
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	31.194642939856607
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	10.794837229332401
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	27.314134989351675
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	14.162720487952125
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	28.464613376827202
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	34.390929640660524
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	27.279385026038113
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	15.438034439812938
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	244.9036900782978
But my point was...	143.25349723105114
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	76.91807442454873
— Ay, says John Wyse.	493.2427669502867
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	28.315721458831668
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	50.776859053309344
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	31.041146995403935
Fontenoy, eh?	284.3169932778216
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	19.496177100578294
But what did we ever get for it?	60.1923554509211
— The French! says the citizen.	120.92166578202324
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	41.85287430942487
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	43.593953121452266
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	68.85408645855252
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	17.373833387213725
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	8.488764572547405

Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	10.54381412447576
The earl of Dublin, no less.	109.1343468108211
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	29.278012199924156

J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	27.173094739071495

says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Yes, sir, says he.	105.48507585393573
I will.	782.2273272657666

says Joe.	142.60217736962247
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	93.82700899850796
May your shadow never grow less.	51.61664501767372
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	165.65170223267376
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	43.719459660893904
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	99.69176780614801
— But do you know what a nation means?	75.57660930885133
says John Wyse.	146.3539617040163
— Yes, says Bloom.	217.36290198896953
— What is it?	290.6756016970602
says John Wyse.	146.3539617040163
— A nation?	981.1219487480283
says Bloom.	279.330522431857
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	47.480385854815346
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	15.656908930302349
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	17.061701008589115
— What is your nation if I may ask?	65.28614305661814
says the citizen.	84.80297256637542
— Ireland, says Bloom.	404.8637341755854
Ireland.	1064.0626132411999
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	16.303000737094717
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	35.53567201981639
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	63.34759793531716
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	19.941110813750992
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	14.297920933207475
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	10.14350280572055
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	11.374150917154187
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	8.787809711789944
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	9.180163002065111
— Show us over the drink, says I.	73.34897661544365
Which is which?	127.35779302005476
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	49.31155962883501
Also now.	702.3339364170367
This very moment.	150.7776901441516
This very instant.	150.7776901441516
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	19.75865480469251
— Robbed, says he.	404.8637341755854
Plundered.	3279.475308279624
Insulted.	3279.475308279624
Persecuted.	3279.475308279624
Taking what belongs to us by right.	13.878830743377025
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	21.767983327951015
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	98.18375296407204
says the citizen.	84.80297256637542
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	122.02509851689125
— Right, says John Wyse.	128.95310513245406
Stand up to it then with force like men.	11.50971343365047
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	48.73399922562982
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	16.703074473839205
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	24.233372448279543
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	12.636760859631023
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	27.456598889447015
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	65.86797738489126
Force, hatred, history, all that.	45.42570298685798
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	20.59448339087351
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	32.9495416770278
— What?	1708.7588479661683
says Alf.	154.622238962144
— Love, says Bloom.	295.74295665108735
I mean the opposite of hatred.	112.88880927139138
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	37.78927877010008
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	23.80944577774412
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	24.674288200403776
Just a moment.	101.25337573080182
Who ’ s hindering you?	157.8615329877104
And off he pops like greased lightning.	80.91300642975833
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	50.21429882811712
Universal love.	711.3009653190022
— Well, says John Wyse.	166.13023900127138
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	25.396361385690323
Love your neighbour.	208.34929664088443
— That chap?	1881.1371180550684
says the citizen.	84.80297256637542
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	50.40191784567241
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	23.36661918124734
Love loves to love love.	79.84045927888042
Nurse loves the new chemist.	72.82237374211775
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	46.83079366526077
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	24.622575683590686
M.	408.8867013473826
B.	354.71935377199077
loves a fair gentleman.	154.27744248794457
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	18.24780844796053
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	30.633083241638886
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	68.29547577763668
Mrs Norman W.	275.2865191380726
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	98.27978219799586
You love a certain person.	268.9319832222862
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	26.014168084310057
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	110.65655081060324
More power, citizen.	60.22200770776748
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	165.65170223267376
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	44.40163255739916
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	47.88953849568539
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	12.800808443106554
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	20.64328325176721
— What ’ s that?	163.73218576815398
says Joe.	142.60217736962247
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	10.36904422053343
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	9.118927512462568
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	10.28370575033439
— Widow woman, says Ned.	244.9036900782978
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	131.343462429078
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	22.303470195626634
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	97.24790096409383
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	45.62896710292278
— Is that by Griffith?	840.3427097491717
says John Wyse.	146.3539617040163
— No, says the citizen.	456.56483841976745
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	59.573481273245896
It ’ s only initialled: P.	43.65375362154506
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	110.6969693466472
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	84.65776553337436
Trade follows the flag.	154.27744248794457
— Well, says J.	155.6973102063267
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	13.247347196461307
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	21.185515414825872
— Casement, says the citizen.	264.3701956840016
He ’ s an Irishman.	535.7110984048286
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	118.16334256438451
J.	244.1848863975607
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	15.539683183738896
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	62.50553444956064
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
says I.	154.622238962144
— Bloom, says he.	223.89312449509535
The courthouse is a blind.	236.75172691695573
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	31.713398808837898
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	128.50976249318674
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	22.067012447263952
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	117.03179732545333
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	17.960841751778734
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	85.87585959683669
A dark horse.	468.0497077068105
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	38.33042197935049
— Mind, Joe, says I.	129.79243225940922
Show us the entrance out.	15.624571202194094
— There you are, says Terry.	397.29595621343435
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	17.63859966285321
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	8.066927928101359
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	10.613090990530013
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	99.69176780614801
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	16.128558999869536
Give us a bloody chance.	47.23734498786352
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	26.05748970217629
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	50.85109745623712
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	11.978627769573492
Loans by post on easy terms.	71.85002890012079
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	25.902289980443
Distance no object.	183.1684056623006
No security.	2951.7761514224244
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	14.208325249113342
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	118.40541859189794
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	33.29616085484349
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	10.11954724009197
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	24.96611558102796
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	29.653668571226095
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	18.15729194879218
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	10.177960793037233
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	32.82697050682973
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	63.274407271536816
Look to our steeds.	101.50508787829176
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	30.699402935007832
I know not what to offer your lordships.	72.68319893379189
— How now, fellow?	328.88000418717354
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	16.012286586688795
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	71.08936916604182
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	75.78740752751007
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	23.11229331538974
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	18.836363050483133
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	23.256525210804092
Hast aught to give us?	72.82237374211775
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	7.920250043097484
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	165.65170223267376
That likes me well.	147.66485365101107
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	29.75046079761603
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	24.71746189582843
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	79.44256162686138
— Where is he?	287.581533232176
says Lenehan.	802.7737472968302
Defrauding widows and orphans.	154.27744248794457
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	22.856862639408874
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	243.67675226912874
Or so they allege.	321.27446591351884
— I, says Joe.	1034.380140019752
I ’ m the alligator.	119.564377304192
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	33.874943717808456
— Why not?	2040.6314877124978
says J.	389.6236827603937
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	29.740081787405092
says Ned.	389.6236827603937
Or who is he?	321.27446591351884
No offence, Crofton.	398.4028579034586
— Who is Junius?	487.7310889728176
says J.	389.6236827603937
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	102.41806327601347
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	16.601541548330953
We know that in the castle.	110.70898435862986
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	57.16806729279728
says Jack Power.	313.20928525981395
— Not at all, says Martin.	87.36474056002808
Only namesakes.	410.83674093262044
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	30.63771860379872
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	54.73898341468132
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	75.24080061902525
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	17.239698249739853
For that matter so are we.	52.83551138370171
— Yes, says J.	179.72090347007338
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	15.036453957504367
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	19.24239733856049
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	63.274407271536816
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	22.390059118854296
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	15.60417653619252
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	121.15919031487381
J.	244.1848863975607
— Do you call that a man?	127.79502711168193
says the citizen.	84.80297256637542
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	61.956193761021474
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	66.48390617793164
— And who does he suspect?	569.0474822203356
says the citizen.	84.80297256637542
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	36.82201958391417
One of those mixed middlings he is.	31.99134984467232
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	15.116395258525236
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	24.593159742651046
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	15.394027643562081
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	26.061822944379713
Give us your blessing.	101.32218711807198
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	121.15919031487381
But where is he?	387.14484319134357
We can ’ t wait.	193.95843140463867
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	43.734632433952974
That ’ s what he is.	53.174063462225476
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	34.20721749289948
Cursed by God.	284.3169932778216
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	50.05001408805975
says Ned.	389.6236827603937
— Only one, says Martin.	186.05878092647762
We must be quick.	274.5640401077329

Three half ones, Terry.	75.51593951540964
— Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	21.365838550262726
— Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	61.989546373766665
God bless all here is my prayer.	53.8933811731558
— Amen, says the citizen.	200.8479182430192
— And I ’ m sure He will, says Joe.	119.45526074920525
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	8.458167250111213

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.	99.69176780614801
And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	8.667002798445242
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	9.17306648720655
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	22.863025488427265
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	8.66231971505849
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	23.410340286222457
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	9.723141845955462
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	63.274407271536816
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	44.97389810264566
And butter for fish.	389.72129441311597
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	19.40268335170428
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	51.2794182201198
I hope I ’ m not...	96.74345806922699
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	122.45091375401789
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	26.898613627813717
Mean bloody scut.	284.3169932778216
Stand us a drink itself.	20.506689545336418
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	13.950118906904262
Cute as a shithouse rat.	72.82237374211775
Hundred to five.	154.26572091933093
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	49.39807123356229
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	72.92449381861343
Come along now.	181.24582457280997
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	27.869624894867357
It ’ s a secret.	57.07413319035468
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	44.47365928427076
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	165.65170223267376
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	13.16154353364443
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	66.85277601932464
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	14.032561209796137
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	9.626273984450272
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	17.742161630769857
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	21.61063465560347
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	10.416221402829848
— Let me alone, says he.	99.82182914793181
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	13.001853895084553
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	17.703145886034328
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	19.91455678486391
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	9.068199251734251
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	36.06892844233993
Your God.	256.3254609158397
— He had no father, says Martin.	113.1340075924495
That ’ ll do now.	503.9977987329417
Drive ahead.	711.3009653190022
— Whose God?	1303.0466859240173
says the citizen.	84.80297256637542
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	120.46154216325078
Your God was a jew.	55.637412620979475
Christ was a jew like me.	15.050361354927675
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	29.361250529656207
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	36.17129000954625
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	32.33370741413103
Give us that biscuitbox here.	50.78697745872954
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	165.65170223267376
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	30.479185418005407
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	10.616169817072398
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	12.195912407387807
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	9.41963213990231
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	8.513066545200157
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	26.898613627813717
And Ned and J.	389.72129441311597
J.	244.1848863975607
paralysed with the laughing.	154.27744248794457
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	44.975502822705494
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	18.244088311535087
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	86.02804453725591
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	16.978593371163413
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	18.049597130119828
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	27.589447266837812
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	15.143411141516411
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	66.67026609741337
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	11.964377336950832
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	13.382704144103952
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	10.064151793601669
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	13.28979836390198
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	9.284677198910803
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	12.210750429940466
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	9.287287527924523
The work of salvage, removal of _débris, _ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, <NUM> Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	15.852166887030624

And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	10.420790826955344
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	17.244055422188765
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	19.901680247004663
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	12.910243732884455
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	9.738638514776532
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	36.906007916342965
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	9.2817646213145
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	17.503938503619636
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	8.997642108558882
M.	408.8867013473826
S.	355.170570843061
Belleisle_ printed on both.	154.27744248794457
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	12.282371871832254
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	12.963098745418144
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	18.452282862944028
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	22.893773741415732
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	13.729187731909509
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	86.0280381600607
Say out big, big.	71.3347300973365
I want a drink of water.	149.33003259841385
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	30.84119529718539
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	9.251825119362335
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	11.050928590805416
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	20.044134615580685
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	14.028196742297526
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	34.198886519327935
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	33.67187026303849
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	18.20586047275436
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	13.158357511239444
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	10.67067738711983
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	140.3711643149578
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	25.363241833210232
Wait till I catch you for that.	38.809777436417264
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	15.633417757401741
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	34.69919473331112
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	12.260225363721014
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	10.078942135905233
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	165.65170223267376
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	17.87869689350409
Butter and cream?	284.3169932778216
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	166.85080075605381
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	219.97945476586156
Cissy queried.	4698.86923761126
— Nao, Tommy said.	261.6026705257836
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	37.34398195935795
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	67.81582253566074
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	55.49619856226785
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	58.743273082712264
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	13.935213035501684
But who was Gerty?	387.14484319134357
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	10.072531032932012
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	17.19842188984326
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	9.77311034946342
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	16.831635224505185
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	10.433652931114837
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	9.746753838819458
No. Honour where honour is due.	80.83684194792775
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	15.252130067331052
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	9.12347964408553
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	10.977338408662039
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	120.67292055248028
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	14.18707642196417
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	28.704091934786856
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	10.403296818369489
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	19.71500807645809
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	25.96723884154266
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	34.10180750364015
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	31.572817857232213
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	14.295384451789703
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	11.089050048322528
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	29.15965555594973
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	32.37873468691079
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	24.649111540024546
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	10.981200270106362
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	11.91000660004317
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	11.003279419886791
E.	349.8337578232202
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	26.898613627813717
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	13.997846911626262
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	18.71047121414207
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	15.495981369345008
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	9.267741964945397
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	12.99847890662448
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	9.644610147585183
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	15.044887852273668
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	10.900085243690185
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	10.463331174945314
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	9.755388166567581
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	11.68347910578396
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	10.488241074395756
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	9.718595783931164
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	8.873697274024211
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	20.728799864985398
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	9.934336672575393
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	68.92095618353008
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	49.48746261104772
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	20.17205287570621
C.	417.9052384715969
D.	367.02493639553404
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	13.802373324473498
He was too young to understand.	371.0059394595221
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	34.26177498726735
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	12.48205163421428
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	12.56833278633254
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	12.873810406574316
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	22.607363630219382
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	9.916254424591079
It would be like heaven.	62.14689309408063
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	27.26156448992395
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	12.744583617225924
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	14.299818139974233
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	13.442781096127439
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	15.303608950617063
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	8.494079731775575
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	8.166403331368292
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	11.688667120892813
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	22.243429125389167
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	9.858872339997633
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	44.89747772529835
It ’ s my ball.	99.78164469689233
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	12.809294421489906
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	93.80260945102032
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	11.579104780813983
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	18.613580208268175
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	36.48657636099265
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	97.24790096409383
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	9.30833554309092
But not a pin cared Ciss.	143.25349723105114
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	21.208982103293984
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	18.01686428369379
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	71.85002890012079
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	119.70247443245157
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	9.16999929329468
That was just like Cissycums.	272.329972917808
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	12.812278444648168
There was none to come up to her for fun.	36.12632939759893
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	15.264944373630819
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	32.394778391777805
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	16.30869649382439
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	18.260138929536332
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	9.705996723122084
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	10.56589000100266
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	9.796664381818267
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	19.427734571662107
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	8.063954419922663
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	24.233124706300774
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	12.068287334624896
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	10.326622300467731
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	9.22577912245124
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	11.175305190840636
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	38.089079704289944
Now he was laid to rest.	120.52095333567655
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	10.408731078229671
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	16.378587745261587
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	11.622116030034798
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	22.318352153055603
You could see there was a story behind it.	24.705287342258554
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	17.802300286982565
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	10.895812900199868
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	11.449458748437118
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	11.510478108939152
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	12.127690026874223
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	11.200052743602408
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	64.07379017358146
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	44.26910163415165
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	18.994225388350216
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	9.694845805971953
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	9.774773817030711
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	9.890829196296368
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	19.700658508213564
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	14.682038339598451
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	10.177537119919723
— Say papa, baby.	275.0727208054576
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	53.03875344476036
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	11.466129785226668
— Haja ja ja haja.	404.8637341755854
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	11.829489288130125
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	45.62896710292278
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	10.257435940208573
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	12.020887995587545
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	89.27230634589307
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	63.5764909978373
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	31.72323721828331
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	18.767221930057016
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	18.087927906147897
People were so queer.	73.16422510501177
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	9.922063780473403
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	16.429906922055192
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	38.885309871368705
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	15.354807476197209
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	17.66308972457391
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	34.06521546484823
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	13.067894973682531
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	10.910448899677599
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	16.22504566669441
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	34.85343087372471
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	10.384307367254213
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	15.15177716013777
Refuge of sinners.	284.3169932778216
Comfortress of the afflicted.	154.27744248794457
_Ora pro nobis_.	284.3169932778216
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	10.73538983728788
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	10.157019365259393
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	11.300502006482409
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	10.043641532230021
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	10.081090776596731
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	18.379629014078397
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	68.9981315551494
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	12.856523729063184
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	16.179178057173708
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	17.032247950578633
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	10.900410633552422
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	10.19156240656601
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	11.943604499640758
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	16.267207763459602
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	8.676165839018836
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	9.263265915971115
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	11.114942940159994
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	10.186952616350723
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	20.186028389280608
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	19.799906432443066
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	10.568310718031519
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	99.96640485420318
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	10.81932022649769
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	8.54794896850514
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	13.194979702447153
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	29.06367245850938
— What?	1708.7588479661683
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	29.75046079761603
I was only wondering was it late.	232.02652054967461
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	12.050112560877622
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	14.059389079128787
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	30.759476397645603
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	24.314686203871915
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	14.455706538469526
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	21.346692336730378
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	11.28986591456982
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	10.876246641169786
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	17.08172696661993
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	21.307290752165574
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	10.10556851283366
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	11.009864007640099
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	13.046468917229609
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	21.150086215988516
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	15.862534164014349
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	22.789761120096333
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	7.997308992062608
Gerty winced sharply.	188.07924764981726
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	30.61534538700688
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	12.626643069767976
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	10.147211258327907
She had loved him better than he knew.	58.89485219017251
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	12.256663316386314
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	11.707851535539444
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	26.476564488588522
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	27.34742826604542
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	14.533319035111965
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	17.975386103848038
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	9.673096371592914
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	15.754558282113113
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	8.914948281724648
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	9.10323832992604
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	9.951308040173057
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	92.1416036281669
He has his bib destroyed.	169.30678846993175
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	26.206139885859656
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	8.998620109733833
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	11.21714852361518
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	9.010394969645589
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	30.756615482305353
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	11.429132904818125
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	8.718183767341957
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	8.970805933084252
But it must end, she felt.	80.23159406949682
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	16.53541852322695
Love laughs at locksmiths.	119.06755845332485
She would make the great sacrifice.	90.0073754327057
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	30.998741013385388
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	17.79339618231513
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	9.897352095773348
But even if — what then?	102.1472194185138
Would it make a very great difference?	54.97678725535651
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	28.43018193875286
No, no: not that.	99.37601976709988
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	15.324680137844629
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	15.254664603822967
She thought she understood.	451.64973660569086
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	34.17509965737485
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	22.0183547122623
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	9.867213900804126
Nothing else mattered.	163.12693328666506
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	30.808807183325698
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	9.574163509854523
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	75.23365049788619
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	12.029599654303794
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	154.95692193318555
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	48.101089652443555
But Gerty was adamant.	268.3778081835865
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	33.12412060603926
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	15.899981916090086
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	36.42175719778069
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	21.747479079266
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	17.381480408588143
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	13.589952636706775
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	31.4801719572014
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	8.687403960702706
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	13.12509078384625
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	9.292076721905097
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	11.769851866060913
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	8.37507999400769
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	10.453772685888207
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	10.366684866938423
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	11.953802326628264
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	168.91366654904363
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	13.214537550470613
What a brute he had been! At it again?	20.29676751340687
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	21.731846235944744
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	13.412711607587651
Should a girl tell?	106.94871078683059
No, a thousand times no.	119.94937975675593
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	13.333362667577783
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	10.731365246212652
Come on.	168.3115807900176
We can see from farther up.	117.95501030124599
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	24.385883220577263
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	17.47243833620009
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	30.41082596595779
She rose.	2056.421227471645
Was it goodbye?	133.06974488137942
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	13.102725943177058
She drew herself up to her full height.	69.45845662843068
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	12.113572437822437
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	19.559637415451494
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	12.527041629505165
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	17.535098306407328
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	18.827852536386807
Tight boots?	211.0500139360508
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	20.249146550456235
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	19.355842403784315
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	26.35153700757748
Jilted beauty.	711.3009653190022
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	58.89699035871132
But makes them polite.	387.14484319134357
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	27.56117819119556
Hot little devil all the same.	39.137487389988074
I wouldn ’ t mind.	198.64001597503395
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	22.989666103795667
That squinty one is delicate.	96.01783395299685
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	23.236866410130258
I have such a bad headache today.	110.86516161262674
Where did I put the letter?	32.63090561110616
Yes, all right.	1304.7043649153102
All kinds of crazy longings.	69.51991274974984
Licking pennies.	711.3009653190022
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	17.52004234632854
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	48.68606297837003
How many women in Dublin have it today?	27.13034632210091
Martha, she.	101.32019343396415
Something in the air.	73.76794154821835
That ’ s the moon.	58.45031783933228
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	17.427679102795206
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	31.484440655360793
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	70.0577935184432
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	67.73263075336398
Anyhow I got the best of that.	38.26978821678771
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	19.566179411263796
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	16.27991787939776
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	32.73699542938933
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	25.82679302662324
Thankful for small mercies.	154.27744248794457
Yours for the asking.	154.27744248794457
Because they want it themselves.	75.28738029629078
Their natural craving.	173.83023283451223
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	38.44965616942778
Reserve better.	711.3009653190022
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	30.265563610575665
Catch em alive, O.	67.73263075336398
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	52.62045876638352
A dream of wellfilled hose.	194.84482612077056
Where was that?	91.08198130058298
Ah, yes.	81.61484996719068
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	38.44965616942778
Peeping Tom.	331.2353408811903
Willy ’ s hat and what the girls did with it.	31.379776809022506
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	23.654922399237435
_Lingerie_ does it.	284.3169932778216
Felt for the curves inside her <URL> Excites them also when they ’ re.	20.1367210714923
I ’ m all clean come and dirty me.	86.5399847577841
Milly delighted with Molly ’ s new blouse.	36.90315718837855
At first.	3782.8735835793927
Put them all on to take them all off.	25.595475082053845
Molly.	760.3207875494005
Why I bought her the violet garters.	94.5203321374634
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	19.904035737903623
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	34.23957594429067
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	79.73483120207445
of jet.	44.69066858595725
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	22.753633542725563
Pinned together.	410.5471886343227
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	59.43691002933586
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	55.693150474036834
Fashion part of their charm.	99.69176780614801
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	33.19811950949147
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	24.160549876251476
No reasonable offer refused.	398.4028579034586
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	92.74793624976678
Always off to a fellow when they are.	31.052490033661886
They never forget an appointment.	149.30262039275652
Out on spec probably.	105.70887973603531
They believe in chance because like themselves.	80.66861103018667
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	44.47365928427076
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	12.800870816303291
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	17.730621482898904
Barbed wire.	711.3009653190022
Be sure now and write to me.	44.138890753811616
Now won ’ t you?	265.83611509321526
Molly and Josie Powell.	98.05359662106714
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	20.580976268150902
_Tableau! _ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	15.890427052084158
What have you been doing with yourself?	75.26854737839733
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	27.86044346574022
Picking holes in each other ’ s appearance.	40.69468172599321
You ’ re looking splendid.	135.59254071252036
Sister souls.	54.616162763369346
Showing their teeth at one another.	54.58606516877998
How many have you left?	72.15685437877461
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	23.503428679291822
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	22.705314491858392
Dark devilish appearance.	23.312818687034007
Scratch the sole of my foot.	54.58606516877998
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	68.3163575405119
Good to rest once in a way.	49.708443046600614
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	27.756810959773873
Safe in one way.	65.71085748492969
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	71.85002890012079
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	31.394389224738397
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	20.187499417968613
Daresay she felt I.	96.16032387952906
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	34.7472493547463
Liked me or what?	154.27744248794457
Dress they look at.	98.27978219799586
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	27.20858092357772
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	37.30628733247314
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	25.655733441804788
Trousers?	1330.846217134227
Suppose I when I was?	211.67422030016138
No. Gently does it.	160.95244533807445
Dislike rough and tumble.	96.16032387952906
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	47.115627388505324
Saw something in me.	24.382490667828606
Wonder what.	347.84964649313054
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	16.704999938740684
To aid gentleman in literary.	246.59564649742663
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	96.75006778455737
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	25.902289980443
Still, you never know.	63.651704857308474
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	51.232820204380715
Beauty and the beast.	16.902509535053795
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	38.90664862273163
Wide brim.	711.3009653190022
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	14.33043372620066
Hair strong in rut.	96.16032387952906
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	28.01273951726496
Why not?	1447.3485355668229
Suppose he gave her money.	196.8797646499256
Why not?	1447.3485355668229
All a prejudice.	155.08831060576856
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	34.81642302427169
What?	2342.5114089148965
I think so.	588.8290623095204
All that for nothing.	67.41498153282114
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	83.32780254640984
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	17.276598818616417
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	36.06892844233993
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	45.42570298685798
No, I remember.	211.80536979715154
Richie Goulding: he ’ s another.	30.73020570175688
Weighs on his mind.	154.27744248794457
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	29.945905611378286
Dust.	1274.0642762518826
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	55.693150474036834
Could do it myself.	90.5271110271198
Save.	381.840419993744
Was that just when he, she?	91.18021974561968
O, he did.	221.91262291144895
Into her.	361.65629589290785
She did.	1753.24505946266
Done.	31.24341885522972
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	24.78732154729444
O Lord, that little limping devil.	104.4517939616158
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	54.58606516877998
Aftereffect not pleasant.	284.3169932778216
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	31.90268277566902
They don ’ t care.	150.45893178049818
Complimented perhaps.	711.3009653190022
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	17.03985740190001
Well, aren ’ t they?	56.32548869209715
See her as she is spoil all.	96.40468050425856
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	17.429780072779337
The name too.	78.24961105625871
_Amours_ of actresses.	284.3169932778216
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.	45.42570298685798
Curtain up.	711.3009653190022
Moonlight silver effulgence.	284.3169932778216
Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	99.69176780614801
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	52.06941831944306
Still, I feel.	58.229096600040904
The strength it gives a man.	153.14632269331
That ’ s the secret of it.	36.76686244106723
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	17.556243673391847
Cider that was.	183.1684056623006
Otherwise I couldn ’ t have.	69.13888138630149
Makes you want to sing after.	54.58606516877998
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	284.3169932778216
Suppose I spoke to her.	211.67422030016138
What about?	902.6391514884599
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	22.869790056739607
Ask them a question they ask you another.	13.007614010042618
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	46.851353418501326
Gain time.	711.3009653190022
But then you ’ re in a cart.	61.682049730668325
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	22.758082672037276
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	36.460744362930896
All the dirty things I made her say.	31.97027216639095
All wrong of course.	146.14620725100127
My arks she called it.	74.93230833215537
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	31.502500703941394
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	22.109503544913103
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	44.17875615514021
Parrots.	3279.475308279624
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	19.374737381733304
Taking a man from another woman.	15.050361354927675
Or even hear of it.	255.9275286209234
Different with me.	165.49959036625415
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	22.4573175570941
Eating off his cold plate.	67.73263075336398
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	23.316187434407347
French letter still in my pocketbook.	78.35301210780398
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	54.524619233197015
Come in, all is prepared.	68.309824417883
I dreamt.	1729.3124201497578
What?	2342.5114089148965
Worst is beginning.	165.49959036625415
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	27.122062443969483
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	10.708581002772089
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	30.14800522829632
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	16.710474961990744
Because I did.	191.90701992754222
She too.	3562.88983263733
Offend her.	711.3009653190022
Then make it up.	415.86026552057393
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	26.898613627813717
Flatters them.	711.3009653190022
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	41.2437272428442
What harm?	1546.7666927240696
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	22.65775771383915
First kiss does the trick.	73.31326073334826
The propitious moment.	954.3116359862598
Something inside them goes pop.	72.49533521620843
First thoughts are best.	107.79026572423427
Remember that till their dying day.	38.57630929004734
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	18.659689158647648
But her breasts were developed.	219.35562064258886
Fell asleep then.	183.1684056623006
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	32.89094694116325
Featherbed mountain.	711.3009653190022
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	99.69176780614801
Val Dillon.	410.5471886343227
Apoplectic.	3279.475308279624
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	29.72799372339712
My fireworks.	431.58920446298544
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	31.128357850222777
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	28.26684077068891
Want to be grownups.	66.26685470960986
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	54.58606516877998
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	25.916536683907207
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	34.32662437286178
I knew she could whistle.	154.04975688891076
Mouth made for that.	24.382490667828606
Like Molly.	721.9916333829775
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	24.116603379048247
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	28.03509544389803
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	21.08469914165278
Caressing the little boy too.	99.69176780614801
Onlookers see most of the game.	71.85002890012079
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	29.616323761635993
In their line.	660.3217378264005
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	19.721376891195415
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	42.29573579350412
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	23.11447976093209
Fine eyes she had, clear.	39.137487389988074
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	17.481181949162238
Did she know what I?	73.94887096824571
Course.	1097.9121264266632
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	22.429609615362125
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	14.03905753645235
Call that innocence?	147.4554224219283
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	23.850931686960582
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	25.316637586130017
Eyes all over them.	86.78485451543763
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	34.53770099793049
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	45.42570298685798
Sharp as needles they are.	99.69176780614801
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	16.309155051851477
Had, too.	195.69722044508225
Where do they get that?	198.2222647618496
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	21.714454233963462
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	22.989666103795667
Bred in the bone.	154.27744248794457
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	20.49150459413083
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	22.312692284485937
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	12.893863353933202
I never told her.	231.2801238201983
Attract men, small thing like that.	55.693150474036834
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	18.15729194879218
Who did you learn that from?	160.87867160420097
Nobody.	37.73746414034323
Something the nurse taught me.	72.49533521620843
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	19.121679630521417
Me have a nice pace.	72.4455383556174
Mullingar.	922.757229076909
Who knows?	1396.4397969065874
Ways of the world.	154.27744248794457
Young student.	154.02362855723538
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	38.44965616942778
Still she was game.	140.811462004924
Lord, I am wet.	46.52290597184739
Devil you are.	23.312818687034007
Swell of her calf.	98.27978219799586
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	55.693150474036834
Not like that frump today.	61.38405389928629
A.	19938.206404913133
E.	349.8337578232202
Rumpled stockings.	410.5471886343227
Or the one in Grafton street.	89.30349032231544
White.	697.8179021829318
Wow! Beef to the heel.	54.58606516877998
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	55.693150474036834
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	16.114285303491567
Will she?	276.0978399861686
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	26.90381569648389
She smelt an onion.	451.64973660569086
Darling, I saw, your.	71.85002890012079
I saw all.	457.2027263781458
Lord! Did me good all the same.	30.11945782593721
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	24.905542347583935
For this relief much thanks.	63.545149278942
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	174.63099958472685
Lord! It was all things combined.	35.27922209293188
Excitement.	3279.475308279624
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	29.639822895753547
Your head it simply swirls.	46.1825577538151
He ’ s right.	1266.0084718170683
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	29.621600869421393
Instead of talking about nothing.	99.69176780614801
Then I will tell you all.	26.10488591105318
Still it was a kind of language between us.	31.90268277566902
It couldn ’ t be?	96.80056808317529
No, Gerty they called her.	119.94937975675593
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	16.40320527853688
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	19.692424694545704
Place made me think of that I suppose.	45.42570298685798
All tarred with the same brush.	68.99073724601803
Wiping pens in their stockings.	99.69176780614801
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	33.94924813837056
Every bullet has its billet.	56.608432722251294
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	28.52872933473371
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	43.62316795256754
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	10.049566786180897
No soft job.	887.6195005876992
Saves them.	711.3009653190022
Nature.	50.75252407334186
Washing child, washing corpse.	72.82237374211775
Dignam.	438.70280385028553
Children ’ s hands always round them.	40.637855059306744
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	17.381480408588143
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	24.649111540024546
Fill it up with wind.	67.73263075336398
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	150.18303261244887
Must call to the hospital.	76.23025388337052
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	50.24536798954714
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	28.847728934544918
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	22.56207130211518
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	40.0137449074552
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	20.79333512909047
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	20.580976268150902
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	29.761664221725155
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	47.01678465067058
Chickens come home to roost.	99.69176780614801
They stick by one another like glue.	80.66861103018667
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	43.89131112449823
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	31.310245599602396
It ’ s the blood of the south.	35.86528634829675
Moorish.	1575.979671522145
Also the form, the figure.	38.89001123022653
Hands felt for the opulent.	55.78965005757743
Just compare for instance those others.	67.3293586459105
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	25.097023538201814
Allow me to introduce my.	99.69176780614801
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	27.353514765922057
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	22.203055974366126
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	28.522463954972604
Have their own secrets between them.	69.9155602495112
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	19.05511760278557
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	27.9801135731899
As God made them he matched them.	55.633700560626764
Twice nought makes one.	106.94871078683059
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	70.0577935184432
Marry in May and repent in December.	43.62316795256754
This wet is very unpleasant.	93.27374481529685
Stuck.	1330.846217134227
Well the foreskin is not back.	68.92870294675954
Better detach.	422.863167134499
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	20.402278176928068
Long and the short of it.	72.57546040133057
Very strange about my watch.	56.608432722251294
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	99.69176780614801
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	17.150041625481567
Yes, I suppose, at once.	67.20293237085599
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	31.484440655360793
I remember looking in Pill lane.	95.78296307654576
Also that now is magnetism.	98.97166398066862
Back of everything magnetism.	96.16032387952906
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	36.460744362930896
That causes movement.	269.7568414819015
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	58.211986260538545
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	36.64875859441589
Because it ’ s all arranged.	97.2292469098783
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	23.234082128613753
Little piece of steel iron.	68.9981315551494
When you hold out the fork.	92.46883584565317
Come.	429.0937688930336
Come.	429.0937688930336
Woman and man that is.	71.37392080945199
Fork and steel.	284.3169932778216
Molly, he.	119.59382402651923
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	11.669332308137959
Tip.	1250.8558942273744
Have to let fly.	94.76763558435911
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	36.68179929876193
Shame all put on before third person.	41.232812167689204
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	30.391037463915517
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	13.01137068100739
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	41.24373512796897
Fine voice that fellow had.	49.78915073502049
How Giuglini began.	313.97322994223293
Smell that I did.	125.76758908023898
Like flowers.	721.9916333829775
It was too.	159.3232213565713
Violets.	3279.475308279624
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	34.65761793055778
Make their own use of everything.	184.66969774419604
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	17.169422236924124
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	35.61473270640559
Keep that thing up for hours.	55.97493998998118
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	17.08030651641637
Wait.	365.9458717894147
Hm. Hm. Yes.	43.79364532713617
That ’ s her perfume.	99.83202083069385
Why she waved her hand.	269.4092412422492
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	28.342805175423308
What is it?	244.41975128248578
Heliotrope?	3279.475308279624
No. Hyacinth?	555.9764709036942
Hm. Roses, I think.	46.044729880055215
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	69.10343015731291
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	39.137487389988074
Why Molly likes opoponax.	492.0559497702007
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	45.42570298685798
Her high notes and her low notes.	33.52588585079237
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	32.40309349451128
Heat brought it out.	106.94871078683059
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	25.70372601108758
Good conductor, is it?	78.0292259727264
Or bad?	3703.4320689699302
Light too.	232.29930891778383
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	182.76990767730044
Mysterious thing too.	183.1684056623006
Why did I smell it only now?	205.90071028996513
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	29.75046079761603
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	35.02719149912977
Yes, it is.	475.1439193903363
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	25.035025347919273
Tell you what it is.	284.726739767334
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	10.812121301895008
Clings to everything she takes off.	71.85002890012079
Warm shoe.	361.65629589290785
Stays.	3279.475308279624
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	45.42570298685798
Byby till next time.	154.27744248794457
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	18.940585269621494
Know her smell in a thousand.	47.66648782989828
Bathwater too.	711.3009653190022
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	71.85002890012079
There or the armpits or under the neck.	46.28384636287484
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	36.46528035053656
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	38.44965616942778
Muskrat.	3279.475308279624
Bag under their tails.	106.94871078683059
One grain pour off odour for years.	51.57383795773844
Dogs at each other behind.	83.67617978478319
Good evening.	463.1372813097385
Evening.	1274.0642762518826
How do you sniff?	594.5718290863489
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	22.779946333275436
Yes now, look at it that way.	90.59222749902182
We ’ re the same.	126.19752210753353
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	19.957058375235796
Come near.	796.8787705753628

Funny little beggar.	107.5643624356902
Wonder where he lives.	173.32341330364585
Belfry up there.	284.3169932778216
Very likely.	264.2053497514561
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	29.710303590491485
Bell scared him out, I suppose.	55.693150474036834

Wonder why they come out at night like mice.	33.548362639848165
They ’ re a mixed breed.	100.64862874661831
Birds are like hopping mice.	66.47866443302057
What frightens them, light or noise?	106.2437684618236
Better sit still.	187.55125985493703
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	16.46013257521514
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	20.05953336976741
Weeny bones.	711.3009653190022
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.	26.417894824319646
Colours depend on the light you see.	43.62316795256754
Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	18.15729194879218
Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.	30.06571936269872

Birds too.	350.02061860370287
Never find out.	1332.0575895618188
Or what they say.	463.4502143425689
Like our small talk.	155.81942904373335
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	33.46196676388118
Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.	35.562472336982246
Dreadful life sailors have too.	67.73263075336398
Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	22.52170262197924
_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	12.035634727548105
Married too.	523.5436006047171
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	34.204836450624455
No ends really because it ’ s round.	86.02341217504402
Wife in every port they say.	35.45585160779291
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	22.226711533990066
If ever he does.	109.50316406690229
Smelling the tail end of ports.	71.85002890012079

And the tephilim no what ’ s this they call it poor papa ’ s father had on his door to touch.	19.358631332905407
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	22.493724619837792
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	17.314635464290205
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	11.5253881206461
Do fish ever get seasick?	95.85194014047234
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones ’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	14.255378135849025
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	65.92154340375276
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	13.93239888020684
They floated, fell: they faded.	102.98860223816708
The shepherd ’ s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	33.33907412522226
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	11.725854996805728
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	26.481667585010506
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	10.788829829621438
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	45.42570298685798
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	53.23944984366237
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	11.656214494674252
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	23.37892997779533
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	32.32459641606424

But being lost they fear.	160.23386223755668
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	68.94784064006865
I didn ’ t want to.	132.21065711390122
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	36.460744362930896
Frightening them with masks too.	99.69176780614801

Far in the grey a bell chimed.	129.08342370897907
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	20.646440941491132

Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	9.75253491985549

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	8.474767134262637
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	8.052404450751913
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	10.085896584064638

Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	8.285957811057886
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	9.711694949399543

As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	26.88015171792191
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	36.89540689242096
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	12.943998911430063
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	16.53197986227301
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	15.3743675521074
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	15.110207807235605
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	11.122286905169927
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	32.687453836176054
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	42.63438502633414
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	9.981737364680503
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	14.336730829115952
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	14.303603391331396
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	16.967089351216643
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	18.220299417383274
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	11.212232275628667
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	15.050361354927675
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	19.219622340038917
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	24.37689316805648
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	9.477809669272869
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	17.489467427536123
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	19.31440857203237
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	11.532256922148626
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	13.583135947165934
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	13.720475789804633
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	12.187491822113833
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	12.328714778857826
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	13.692880543077147
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	22.65024817297832
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	12.286411504211907
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	15.33907379677358
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	11.941110060820328
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	13.789413824545639
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	16.756018071681403
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	11.393162835772046
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	23.85567311074218
Thanked be Almighty God.	154.27744248794457
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	10.89496347208689
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	11.353422336979289
Meseems it dureth overlong.	154.27744248794457
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	10.709062632079599
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	14.715380488643948
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	26.094161411118414
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	10.484438694319595
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	10.79749137119526
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	33.63924890274436
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	24.077756527544107
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	8.439705768341273
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	11.41784909395082
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	21.346692336730378
For they were right witty scholars.	52.83551138370171
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	9.865345072532621
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	11.546385116964002
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	12.494050739710659
A redress God grant.	337.1606960464125
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	12.475986243655067
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	13.273465320706485
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	11.287515070422032
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	21.116104170730967
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	14.313621942577024
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	13.866997395611998
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	49.22387075334515
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	25.075758134798146
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	47.01678465067058
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	10.941979112702287
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	9.199755295105044
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	10.231863998515035
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	9.431605223784466
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	9.9583654714341
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	14.919607187735025
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	9.547167191107135
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	15.58900013072594
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	10.138522002316156
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	10.651657220530037
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	8.414748830416828
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	8.95783408402032
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	16.353511149310854
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	22.989666103795667
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	17.067850339707782
See ye here.	1311.4209370320868
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	15.75022589246392
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	24.196499302167364
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions.	23.704083904122324
What means this?	909.2971776400653
Desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	13.842371800255483
Mark me now.	23.312818687034007
In woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	16.949337251622076
This is the postcreation.	64.93489556371264
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	65.95694718610656
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	9.517275215035959
But here is the matter now.	143.25349723105114
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	10.312235629402977
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l ’ avait mise dans cette fichue position c ’ était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	11.78413845868183
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	36.83605769219877
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	25.16118074529172
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	90.5345373195527
With will will we withstand, withsay.	113.15234187323898
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	8.642865401558366
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	8.12183919948464
In Horne ’ s house rest should reign.	103.17376918305901
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	10.688576809947909
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	9.806053932875868
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	18.151086474467068
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	8.880320200181925
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	10.487407154554663
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	17.246406865369714
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	11.26034351716562
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	10.357991803970577
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	21.7095973244894
Go thou and do likewise.	69.89245556622114
Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden.	11.620062119605608

Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	10.179667627508453
Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	14.64178378985531
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	21.288767513393463
Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	11.878063200981385
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	21.469424375262605
And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.	16.947368926080113
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell ’ s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.	10.704222160324388

And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.	9.996541839311847
The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.	15.555250719048326
First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage.	10.878458346571152
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	10.59877109810808
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	10.398655591711524
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn ’ s bivouac.	12.917146345776553
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	36.92178760117455
Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	25.121786637262968
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	34.65761793055778
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	18.87945137636509
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	10.62674277188418
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	12.439514505008841
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	15.254829979746074
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	24.028917939216623
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	8.746775456869596
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	35.61473270640559
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	32.32459641606424
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	61.960087802779576
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	19.614116109763838
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	29.75046079761603
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	14.252539982804326
Heard?	1274.0642762518826
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	16.438605456365988
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	13.060818007956266
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	30.84119529718539
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	11.58617466951008
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	11.425791819830804
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	9.844879754216183
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	8.513266840807484
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	14.449083618618358
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	10.19785017821918
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	250.44911977644475
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	9.856587584600536
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	12.093445402914579
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	17.34497431451871
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	11.37458599457912
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	9.170500198650872
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	12.331634293904077

Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	8.500889860470899

Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	8.916368773828031
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	10.59295607315427
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	9.604711869212387
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	9.273241138574383
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	10.722258475175268
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	19.082547684393685
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	10.246780492102596
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	20.705518560813363
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	12.019068753543511
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	16.82768790730004
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	10.386008983033692
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	12.447024474583406
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	9.050158827334682
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	11.678401293320821
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	15.242778469341712
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	25.79214742702335
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	38.996604910961054
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	10.83260334382111
I question with you there, says he.	80.74317228624768
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	26.972224973583923
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	9.804866500174848
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	31.57925385953727
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	12.68700771342275
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	174.35933059811111
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	12.443293093030068
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	19.623569803151838
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	11.95850480711511
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	14.641680973383133
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	14.749941236759595
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	9.258136868561959
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	9.309093533424054
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	13.62428162187407
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	11.794294305029476
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	9.465879155994827
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	9.97637638152898
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	11.63005809608116
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	24.653409102163838
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	9.216022677817321
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	11.668540068492577
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	8.903099595834975
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	22.357117186871015
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	8.69587707233909
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	12.134709453382815
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	9.918047125355887
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	11.227077530924443
Fertiliser and Incubator.	284.3169932778216
Lambay Island_.	711.3009653190022
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	10.943908899477744
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	19.03614794502477
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	80.74317228624768
Come, be seated, both.	49.39722002049187
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	40.542114569269124
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	9.271072477126642
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	9.174443714830547
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	10.531845388970526
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	10.882783993655869
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	14.117323066920955
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	14.862774377984337
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	10.023296527091972
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	12.407165718636419
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	12.684581193489299
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	12.040771737924057
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	8.71194592563443
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	10.398655591711524
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	14.994994610434379
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	10.111934587625631
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	10.806201619183948
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	9.903675252269467
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	10.57498866486848
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	12.728837832976962
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	23.9680560164085
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	8.673727277002365
That you may and very opportunely.	69.52771849452989
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	33.98792246001526
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	10.134094106400829
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	11.520452583838694
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	9.373697756946818
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	36.16686344282946
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	12.498037820395464
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	16.520477343493596
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	10.130220279098031
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	56.15944671797471
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	40.22339600084948
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	71.85002890012079
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	15.962851939668408
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	20.367663458816995
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	10.802090077124298
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	9.56308906629271
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	16.058485666169727
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	38.44965616942778
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	83.2233814680901
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	19.056685622842465
No woman of any wit would wear one.	80.26268160388507
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	9.346741907088612
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	17.017178874101393
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	9.803407958900124
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	11.524638621102005
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	21.288767513393463
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	35.40235968474163
What, you dog?	180.83241265306356
Have you a way with them?	125.26732469682476
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	29.75046079761603
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	11.83006390097251
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	12.752691044080622
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	25.061360977472784
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	14.344678525114707
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	11.914369924562811
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	12.973713525830952
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	14.677706153939775
I cannot away with them.	165.62576776171457
What?	2342.5114089148965
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	15.114749729883131
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	28.92305336147201
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	11.47957438205171
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	10.439597804000508
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	10.044790631077278
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	10.296720837984237
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	12.739523231176587
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	10.267427316281873
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	9.307157777666944
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	8.960481525774254
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	9.912386436307072
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	9.306142986713127
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	10.897191105411176
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	9.094059935131654
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	17.42852409358096
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	10.605163482583158
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	32.71457752677828
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	41.0275050864657
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	19.633402979917072
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	10.56064471750196
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	9.39688167550168
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	13.101289327702812
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	11.613553577733944
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	49.466350323252335
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	9.899494139137495
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	22.17673891854986
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	13.459467780030899
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	11.815597040266102
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	12.873810406574316
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	8.961045808966839
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	44.499454079473
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	17.945881768090864
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	30.61534538700688
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	11.103743773239495
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	32.45863375209889
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	9.772396716022682
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	12.835861137345455
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	9.709998795134775
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	20.736211526310342
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	18.300128358709934
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	7.8297135463604075
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	9.696472948764283
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	13.007197055286602
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	10.728250794221685
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	55.42059883550668
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	11.073512412192851
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	10.536852958317782
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	10.192969182799706
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	53.00745917151254
He conjured up the scene before them.	109.4915174924078
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	30.479185418005407
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	10.062400082643226
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	19.60207169008109
Yes, it is true.	685.7469843488628
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	165.66614357026776
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	30.84119529718539
This is the appearance is on me.	31.278956997242048
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	11.298844243974925
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	23.320336021478816
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	31.136419268440743
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	13.972212963127022
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	84.06875939483673
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	15.524531868952563
He was gone.	3931.235690466441
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	40.95046369527936
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	20.96180597963838
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	29.248585204602996
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	55.693150474036834
The mystery was unveiled.	423.1963682690693
Haines was the third brother.	78.46053341772199
His real name was Childs.	162.6788706043163
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	40.023485582474464
He drank drugs to obliterate.	122.48726273997825
For this relief much thanks.	63.545149278942
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	83.2233814680901
No soul will live there.	224.81190698655448
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	83.2233814680901
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	109.1343468108211
A curse is on it.	194.84482612077056
It is haunted.	178.74358785631793
Murderer ’ s ground.	82.57582936802655
What is the age of the soul of man?	60.87790937028567
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	11.476816107692088
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	15.018576850919283
A score of years are blown away.	93.79034352900702
He is young Leopold.	1412.391234407702
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	15.656449260752808
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	9.908732763980975
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	9.423947252625709
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	17.017178874101393
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	32.47932009348884
Who can say?	1032.5646594129869
The wise father knows his own child.	109.1343468108211
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	20.914205901199278
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	10.789708116372278
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	15.58389379722583
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	15.676259908038691
Did heart leap to heart?	101.23391061378452
Nay, fair reader.	18.53662849232526
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	15.260638607178416
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	34.17509965737485
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	69.07909524420315
No, Leopold.	645.5301228328058
Name and memory solace thee not.	49.0307551095004
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	22.46359380155992
No son of thy loins is by thee.	64.42249483049743
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	19.361424709363465
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	14.291925232052211
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	17.03150552158106
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	37.8792177950501
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	13.37367710213261
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	63.582365156476826
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	21.151374073172708
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	45.42570298685798
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	19.912197005920042
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	16.11036383964698
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	13.972212963127022
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	10.398655591711524
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	16.11036383964698
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	13.761694746185709
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	15.911643078836205
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	17.73639148233863
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	12.164021772923837
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	9.369655455336861
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	17.381480408588143
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	73.83839703570605
Where were they now?	343.9888957432248
Neither knew.	361.65629589290785
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	36.239258944730146
Why think of them?	492.0559497702007
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	23.583781415105335
Who supposes it?	1032.5646594129869
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	14.348326766510985
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	33.400405100033744
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	12.053740670652
All who wish you well hope this for you.	37.3307023941514
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	19.74525956442159
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	80.74317228624768
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	31.019019404977993
Have no fear.	272.16849363974234
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	63.68241575638903
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	56.279804950142804
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	17.302970151338062
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	21.781115056458635
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	10.204407578797014
He told them of the race.	131.8720328174756
Madden up.	24.990771238543836
She was leading the field.	178.85420742523965
All hearts were beating.	146.14620725100127
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	54.233055735608104
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	12.95148696654349
All was lost now.	146.14620725100127
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	38.44965616942778
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	45.42570298685798
A tear fell: one only.	129.14506950814115
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	52.408840564237366
Lane.	1575.979671522145
Four winners yesterday and three today.	41.06049749179847
What rider is like him?	228.72009114248254
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	15.859869261825105
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	53.00745917151254
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	20.78526268559104
She is not the filly that she was.	54.39795553670071
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	53.88439340098825
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	36.059167875591264
Do you remember her, Vincent?	51.07073110312179
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	34.67082695050932
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	12.62996884445315
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	20.055609049373114
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	14.30855711173405
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	17.59953585163304
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	15.526916513460518
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	18.88067746309497
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	11.098921211670083
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	14.873114662039018
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	30.618342293566474
But he had been kind.	107.75957865188911
In going by he had blessed us.	113.55165512604025
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	66.67026609741337
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	13.785774200535583
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	23.22770811364957
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	38.44965616942778
His soul is far away.	222.7027678702565
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	18.622784018973174
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	14.1326950277668
Do you not think it, Stephen?	52.49334671452277
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	16.791865564626686
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	13.158357511239444
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	8.28931224137862
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	11.9402586137283
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	9.427945610077474
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	11.815774858562913
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	9.020996055249158
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	26.206139885859656
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	34.65761793055778
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	22.701237065767675
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	14.403002223746965
A gallant scene in truth it made.	93.79034352900702
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	20.633159164146385
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	16.241987385834506
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	12.387362853355315
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	11.821959536182872
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	8.836653237853499
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	17.211800337725386
Dedalus ’ (Div.	95.28046934674923
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	15.653877871927145
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	16.62392622443868
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	14.107428262770718
Bloom (Pubb.	477.00045322407885
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	31.484440655360793
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	9.371624324007456
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	10.797052588867313
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	23.423356334142767
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	13.681819965214826
Mr M.	768.6682090211917
Mulligan (Hyg.	107.5643624356902
et Eug.	711.3009653190022
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	16.267207763459602
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	34.20721749289948
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	9.926423172178133
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	9.298990161431876
Mr J.	768.6682090211917
Crotthers (Disc.	183.1684056623006
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	9.819128530324859
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	11.75996596525441
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	12.843534253110986
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	58.77883580787306
Lynch (Bacc.	169.844725319057
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	9.492399351740643
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	10.14989161247655
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	7.622446308702089
Mr S.	768.6682090211917
Dedalus ’ (Div.	95.28046934674923
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	8.683447176759119
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	8.805696733576148
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	62.63829239430834
Bloom (Pubb.	477.00045322407885
Canv.) which took place in the commons ’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	12.2708539330476

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	13.966315914775384
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	13.972212963127022
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	15.937933069423353
She had.	1983.468979664321
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	33.934058719336534
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	13.566848494464306
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	10.130220279098031
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	11.711102933427163
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	14.883691306155818
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	13.429439835063258
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	8.7973471110732
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	13.684326792589914
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	29.556931624448076
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	32.397077522129976
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	10.606155392779327
He knows and will call in His own good time.	41.93012768569326
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	29.39946743793066
Sir, to you my hand.	47.66648782989828
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	10.646342408070243
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	14.885984052830715
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	9.231103784407454
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	10.43324209002916
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	11.219850719020105
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	12.249649091100808
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	10.586960534525499
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	10.122729356070085
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	12.249649091100808
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	11.140176503676217

The end comes suddenly.	293.36956372985276
Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.	19.28299016057313
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	24.02673699622262
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	12.873810406574316
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	9.241658320574146

Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in D ’ Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox.	13.990602369579321
By word and deed he frankly encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises.	14.30056125645031
In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males.	28.707606360695912

No bones broken.	887.6195005876992
Well, I ’ ll shove along.	55.05456863014098
_ (He laughs.) _ I ’ ve a rendezvous in the morning.	56.5229373890287
Burying the dead.	183.1684056623006
Safe home! THE HORSE: _ (Neighs.) _ Hohohohohome.	18.12256636790278
BLOOM: Good night.	150.06427626304867
I ’ ll just wait and take him along in a few...	27.274269182701282
_ (Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it.	32.67824616535064
The horse harness jingles.) _ CORNY KELLEHER: _ (From the car, standing.) _ Night.	23.11278595232358
BLOOM: Night.	275.0253223636923
_ (The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly.	31.46299419575591
The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.	40.023485582474464
Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom ’ s plight.	16.163575012212448
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat.	30.81497164086781
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.	85.61095384966251
With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	18.78082340775751
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	25.718814659014377
The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.	45.93806484559014
Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.	38.986573564967436
Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.	37.22289170508455
The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay.	36.906007916342965
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen ’ s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute.	17.923791993947486
Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.) _ BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _ (There is no answer; he bends again.) _ Mr Dedalus! _ (There is no answer.) _ The name if you call.	15.766573556388693
Somnambulist.	3279.475308279624
_ (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) _ Stephen! _ (There is no answer.	18.15244704669136
He calls again.) _ Stephen! STEPHEN: _ (Groans.) _ Who?	48.69994262376881

A dog barks in the distance.	98.11438197467672
Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant.	68.40682619223206
He looks down on Stephen ’ s face and form.) _ BLOOM: _ (Communes with the night.) _ Face reminds me of his poor mother.	19.895107878195628

_ (Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master.	19.231466973334943
Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.	10.87770451288825
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.) _ BLOOM: _ (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) _ Rudy! RUDY: _ (Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom ’ s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.	14.10674324844023
He has a delicate mauve face.	81.4350661060766
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.	22.2915065754527
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.	15.911795673216366
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	11.465094071916914
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	9.353117680721157
But how to get there was the rub.	63.323973652663106
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	11.152839379745325
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	9.366866303648829
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	9.784951382621513
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	10.935684731076188
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	10.588449441173404
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	12.081747582894941
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	11.126659145323108
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	10.006006942092919
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	8.566737053887481
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	12.282252088723903
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	8.337333334707536
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	8.745410563805526
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	11.075155117988547
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	13.52149590305495
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	9.938621936107605
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	14.276488265865
s.	357.16037040104015
d.	29.680256129905434
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	8.993336420335917
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	10.616496173512214
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	37.70393391290457
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	11.83564484249612
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	12.961275214282795
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	10.113721744618147
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	33.824238726987936
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	96.87865610881964
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	14.288393377173595
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	11.432947090511846
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	8.562490862461152
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	14.783513866110278
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	20.265262504070897
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	17.08172696661993
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	9.7160034839023
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	13.21055973957245
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	10.708581002772089
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	21.87822881083838
His friends had all deserted him.	145.16435036620675
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	14.322415470467176
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	20.084250384496112
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	11.79504994652906
Anyhow he was all in.	44.95346598190472
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	24.567881820414495
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	25.136739706260975
Try it.	144.81867718130366
You may mention my name.	196.4481704397512
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	26.57900395067286
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	45.43871449598864
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	37.23007266777893
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	57.42701393997982
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	12.501816308847815
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	9.155143208132461
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	62.57980933083148
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	10.047020380715427
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	8.954090065357478
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	13.557915764651131
Whereas.	1330.846217134227
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	9.767094199994938
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	32.4549310641134
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	13.819718892963795
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	41.703216033657775
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	54.40679817700319
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	34.170354460319736
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	9.707493605276131
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	58.743273082712214
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	51.39386019123081
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	120.53804640727805
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	73.52553354279371
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	80.15093744102754
Who ’ s that with you?	117.14414526197844
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	18.964483175619286
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	27.354053288985813
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	15.966343715890163
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	16.71427370939965
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	28.93026364062424
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	11.858266854977945
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	11.081625907117093
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	12.828832715462472
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	12.139674048345663
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	9.972500378061248
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	20.91669016153481
Pretty thick that was certainly.	67.73263075336398
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	15.522673213760092
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	17.111255263235034
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	17.7699068356811
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	10.175553586207576
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	59.187181642300416
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	16.07337905236388
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	48.422401785073724
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	64.80815860202918
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	18.54894093343355
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	20.47077610032868
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	19.167850033645028
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	30.60454864959248
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	23.493952570157187
Simply fag out there for nothing.	54.58606516877998
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	25.185207811004005
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	59.68312287983085
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	21.95742351878675
Where does he live at present?	131.10173573219524
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	58.942732417246084
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	74.05307582967487
Why?	3668.761700153618
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	22.507169233337365
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	47.505126779801266
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	8.711961633719044
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	8.386582133108446
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	13.571369040451488
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	17.506412703936824
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	25.8278863267035
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	14.9099366026185
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	8.72680240811489
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	23.007214552901843
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	9.928329371561786
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	12.873810406574316
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	10.85522156224339
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	54.20691433997979
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	62.92384588325196
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	10.733035059785774
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	9.726223533828446
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	14.979591102903555
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	22.71474114628846
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	11.3090685011592
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	9.180576175525815
I mean for singing purposes.	228.72292722967134
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	20.736497888473348
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	38.44965616942778
_Belladonna.	3279.475308279624
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	12.862410354483917
They were haggling over money.	121.43818190676627
— Is that so?	1855.2357032687414
Mr Bloom asked.	81.84529962123028
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	11.387439408803422
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	13.393664229490327
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	12.522358439711303
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	11.653559338184975
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	31.933825815660704
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	45.42570298685798
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	104.53374054910071
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	71.85002890012079
What ’ s in a name?	79.40588078177878
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	71.49943447545364
Of course.	346.98427353367754
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	21.21132704146481
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	14.297920933207475
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	12.98873677631283
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	10.650305348281133
— You know Simon Dedalus?	277.5873669101525
he asked at length.	154.1072371926544
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	134.94085738384248
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	22.069131936051175
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	36.20231402257404
All Irish.	655.8145920333396
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	111.53746668342215
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	9.020803959569797
The lefthand dead shot.	423.1963682690693
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	12.918165456626678
— Bottles out there, say.	244.9036900782978
Fifty yards measured.	284.3169932778216
Eggs on the bottles.	154.27744248794457
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	71.85002890012079
Aims.	3279.475308279624
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	49.90330158982891
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	19.51991156154183
— Pom! he then shouted once.	129.7511806500045
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	28.143685879298417
— Pom! he shouted twice.	186.05878092647762
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	10.192969182799706
— Long ago?	2022.6103650516063
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	57.527360933160175
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	16.072442966011465
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	50.1067961862942
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	56.325498224131586
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	80.29396129256479
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	80.29396129256479
D.	367.02493639553404
B.	354.71935377199077
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	239.45377358627616
Know where that is?	89.26558162626948
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	244.9036900782978
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	110.06863543437261
That ’ s where I hails from.	36.96432428392545
I belongs there.	898.2787381285967
That ’ s where I hails from.	36.96432428392545
My little woman ’ s down there.	48.17400485432497
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	53.39578371522782
_For England, home and beauty_.	71.85002890012079
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	21.49358087998738
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	12.606420774316096
Across the world for a wife.	48.755742369643414
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	9.696729055344814
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	37.00102704798567
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	14.407200558478179
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	29.573702671237466
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	24.51088303942053
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	25.121786637262968
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	15.570653856857371
No chair for father.	398.4028579034586
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	20.10486406634645
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	17.782571630102726
Grin and bear it.	154.27744248794457
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	64.86152321931513
B.	354.71935377199077
Murphy.	939.5186216197353
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	10.659888509658998
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	13.257176183715357
— Thank you, the sailor said.	122.58013917916286
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	15.224712995991942
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	109.1343468108211
I shipped to get over.	226.73698664214498
Paid off this afternoon.	154.27744248794457
There ’ s my discharge.	72.1817068023366
See?	41915.03734657804
D.	367.02493639553404
B.	354.71935377199077
Murphy.	939.5186216197353
A.	19938.206404913133
B.	354.71935377199077
S.	355.170570843061
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	20.35625398678042
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	25.69267557005686
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	19.034880938688833
I was in the Red Sea.	102.24625378148443
I was in China and North America and South America.	34.41649701034051
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	110.4726487078219
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	95.78296307654576
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	14.886235378638736
I seen Russia.	450.38190235688506
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	711.3009653190022
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	45.68333285417359
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	47.60877983082285
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	44.34598479582087
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	47.39152607679502
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	22.84520510068409
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	15.947042129504833
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	27.295670644280577
Look here.	657.6908271588806
Here they are.	296.77413089791406
A friend of mine sent me.	129.14506950814115
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	16.3834207121275
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	55.42059883550668
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	10.324650059310004
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	75.78740752751007
Stomachs like breadgraters.	284.3169932778216
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	30.291753503217663
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	36.82092983133409
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	25.622117209728287
— Know how to keep them off?	165.65170223267376
he inquired generally.	293.2267843741906
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	15.832418404662093
That boggles ’ em.	147.66485365101107
Glass.	2179.400143858039
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	14.103792543925604
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	13.497124133854193
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	7.951952020492947
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	12.333214672211277
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	10.901378717280453
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	9.867704600639412
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	8.600679796828228
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	12.13432166025043
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	9.590560540133016
That was the rub.	229.85121549748524
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	9.44714394494644
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	9.498131758882158
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	7.9919719637037
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	14.307436760286025
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	11.300127910011536
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	32.89631685193376
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	17.80831517863001
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	23.84901973537256
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	24.649111540024546
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	16.267207763459602
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	64.1901933750678
Knife in his back.	96.16032387952906
Knife like that.	161.2259711689697
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	17.239698249739853
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	40.80589894454954
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	11.802249288984472
Like that.	147.84158631784112
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	45.42570298685798
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	29.75046079761603
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	19.07667159337594
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	30.331047801047138
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	11.236394117972859
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	17.259222875211933
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	19.880274725686068
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	9.942464149896738
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	15.131263362787923
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	22.318352153055603
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	16.245677162576843
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	11.109284430105301
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	181.74195524945904
Give us back them papers.	69.52593419051732
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	43.556098214080386
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	82.193423717593
Mr Bloom inquired.	301.39331495706153
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	13.47091665480407
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	11.90372404428597
— What year would that be about?	170.33946433665645
Mr B interrogated.	302.51801005871334
Can you recall the boats?	55.31031784755563
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	14.836805579953843
Salt junk all the time.	67.73263075336398
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	72.82237374211775
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	10.271402642448543
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	11.054335911924037
And it left him wondering why.	78.4208815208439
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	11.915710062950813
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	24.303495523267298
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	7.918715449943703
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	15.35732977968362
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	16.267207763459602
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	47.120602758035396
I hate roaming about.	50.057519262518625
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	11.490153389536225
— What age is he?	419.65357665192806
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	10.75539044244198
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	26.2502465940685
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	54.65485498642645
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	13.408618500051011
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	45.2192883158613
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	43.9047146029
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	40.9739536270787
I hate those buggers.	50.057519262518625
Suck your blood dry, they does.	55.693150474036834
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	10.20338304675831
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	244.9036900782978
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	27.59331619609612
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	13.137958941354741
There he is himself, a Greek.	39.164396756779745
one asked the sailor.	154.27744248794457
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	24.40388990150841
Someway in his.	284.3169932778216
Squeezing or.	711.3009653190022
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	68.48498624296958
There he is cursing the mate.	48.35070486939877
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	13.154522303772543
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	12.795197010224665
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	26.721747991875795
He ’ s gone too.	364.2077195727768
Ate by sharks after.	106.94871078683059
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	25.025275642750344
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	93.80260945102032
— And what ’ s the number for?	223.40091912461165
loafer number two queried.	154.27744248794457
a third asked the sailor.	67.73263075336398
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	13.763189429718292
Ate.	1575.979671522145
A Greek he was.	337.1606960464125
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	13.888058268248159
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	9.242702272038125
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	10.883007228223954
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	26.801289142670015
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	10.229704909004647
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	11.323381067530761
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	9.973144368718907
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	120.92166578202324
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	12.452091215965885
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	19.537806783222546
Still no matter what the cause is from...	26.616798290918986
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	15.996188874717012
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	18.75720667064191
She is a bad merchant.	128.97014380008207
She buys dear and sells cheap.	160.8057022664704
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	9.63168459446326
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	15.913375056951208
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	25.571312914460755
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	16.223152917507445
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	16.700287122601942
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	20.580976268150902
Do you?	622.6356301762221
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	10.593127911507109
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	9.680440077067118
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	11.084139603144822
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	57.2542094639475
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	12.091076101891057
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	9.983700654430722
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	20.437973350373703
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	15.073199499855903
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	16.804568935072332
I ’ m not so sure about that.	70.3805993370004
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	12.73638761454309
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	9.489260246945703
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	28.829344523927606
Let me stir it.	1709.443795660005
And take a piece of that bun.	103.30061877438706
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	23.000026910211677
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	23.229281010858234
Try a bit.	181.32531720953463
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	24.680077832463304
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	10.89307699669836
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	12.01740660132851
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	17.779712427280455
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	13.917702342508171
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	11.397683719675001
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	44.72663533952109
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	10.91413312898368
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	13.747497597700539
You ought to eat more solid food.	85.80100231208054
You would feel a different man.	120.10395938384899
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	121.15919031487381
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	53.00745917151254
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	41.89358300914854
It reminds me of Roman history.	70.02340573911958
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	11.193831517086883
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	13.928534807799709
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	22.76310839790033
Look at him.	153.36882015109938
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	9.346130123391708
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	15.087606182887908
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	9.735604816588141
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	10.006762568782603
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	10.6333644606919
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	14.045795055390261
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	33.58324158054178
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	29.75046079761603
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	17.6347834394044
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	10.26039439963532
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	38.23404948660852
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	7.816666300119798
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	9.219676444203252
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	13.777459182532677
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	30.900276780371208
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	22.203058836936783
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	14.315315569439836
She has the Spanish type.	150.5435426701468
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	43.473381653327436
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	64.86152321931513
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	19.570392884965308
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	27.510736255869347
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	154.27744248794457
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	120.8717734292488
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	12.84690494126049
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	46.68727564015987
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	37.85693937929808
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	13.669341781047471
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	109.1343468108211
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	44.179569066408455
An exception here and there.	261.87422449518056
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	17.508152442547853
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	12.33654674081089
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	14.289219286462455
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	11.889487718040549
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	38.44965616942778
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	10.933112344615136
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	11.456953739225465
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	11.308065860404652
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	54.938141217802496
s.	357.16037040104015
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	13.972212963127022
No aid was given.	398.4028579034586
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	16.12870334220848
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	33.12412060603926
At this stage an incident happened.	116.23348977812097
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	21.08956708927043
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	19.485805186966243
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	10.968398154511604
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	9.050653109143614
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	10.09576548282721
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	8.967542338437303
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	37.60492156329145
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	8.322780125616605
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	19.648912555785593
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	11.32677345203211
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	13.231159560060181
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	22.95680418751748
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	30.09297423680648
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	13.171560136913781
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	8.661388317375076
— Am I right, skipper?	186.05878092647762
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	19.71467233496668
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	11.816279330791076
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	10.235261453811754
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	9.480803386008681
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	8.460644664455618
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	20.92066256975469
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	11.954651601232337
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	10.061993390646219
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	30.181848869921893
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	83.2233814680901
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	10.070078275183404
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	20.27822350959673
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	16.116998715951734
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	31.484440655360793
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	66.67026609741337
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	19.513550890419737
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	19.54055645063428
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	86.07215121499617
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	59.206269421062586
And the best jumpers and racers?	83.63901141683141
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	37.028781928665765
Tell me that.	101.3144350911299
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	29.62458728894884
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	111.11387797635636
The Irish catholic peasant.	293.36956372985276
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	122.54037875764679
You know Jem Mullins?	325.4188152966533
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	11.57660259284278
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	11.509273591743511
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	9.713856382566302
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	8.932251877481576
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	10.956197278510421
And now, why?	149.2672628468036
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	9.936395049936094
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	9.093061248472104
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	19.86556370135735
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	8.052575075797977
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	18.017286186020193
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	33.39071373281807
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	24.747363712290138
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	14.322415470467176
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	26.754832599970698
s.	357.16037040104015
d.	29.680256129905434
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	13.042230033131139
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	16.309095743458204
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	23.172431524557155
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	40.11412351750617
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	10.346809292884501
A soft answer turns away wrath.	98.11438197467672
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	40.55886714708555
Am I not right?	60.50325862716979
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	16.34448474735683
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	16.61023401013326
— Of course, Mr B.	128.86212017947352
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	24.649111540024546
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	10.77955221282108
But with a little goodwill all round.	76.14189028038862
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	17.615087804640858
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	57.2542094639475
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	49.47966396613407
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	58.89699035871132
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	12.49840399377685
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	23.4530199928983
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	38.999313534491044
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	48.20212751610578
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	37.24539033871716
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	9.068806715236622
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	127.68487833496931
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	15.747601394835188
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	10.272427734922502
Why?	3668.761700153618
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	37.32034749206915
They are practical and are proved to be so.	51.897298635615904
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	21.347055629743593
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	26.636286773900068
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	24.649111540024546
Turks.	3279.475308279624
It ’ s in the dogma.	65.92889461870692
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	14.193742465447256
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	15.593630146801335
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	10.92311298283334
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	12.726820137427378
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	36.46079215746754
I call that patriotism.	348.7319509550507
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	17.381480408588143
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	33.97019712954967
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	14.078822910528544
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	12.983329368719982
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	15.790799817227636
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	54.20691433997979
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	23.115474801571242
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	20.10486406634645
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	36.490198212865366
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	31.25752191790309
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	27.86044346574022
That ’ s work too.	99.83202083069385
Important work.	711.3009653190022
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	11.242026837756136
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	19.315263743097333
What?	2342.5114089148965
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	50.76466805338956
Each is equally important.	125.76758908023898
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	19.22031430520867
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	104.85324146903527
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	26.33136027803258
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	35.1607302816914
Excuse me.	193.2974044776159
What was it you...?	81.67207599174066
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	14.2319290155165
Let us change the subject.	143.532138177758
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	14.145224590335056
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	47.39778885945854
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	13.5028520609765
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	11.957600102167197
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	9.496393834532713
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	9.210460160907228
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	9.158299305654884
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	8.133856995597512
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	9.01790806847119
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	9.570272343171432
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	55.693150474036834
With brains, sir.	446.7813870930605
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	10.110232970654094
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	15.232103221699187
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	17.415582775603095
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	9.564396040506145
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	21.346692336730378
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	11.467391031805867

Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.	71.85002890012079
— There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	45.2192883158613
— Who?	1529.4170804259302
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	24.082193387214847

He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no <NUM> until he was his old self again with no - one to point a finger at him.	12.969436237372669
Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses.	15.869350138896943
Dead he wasn ’ t.	65.32546950189179
Simply absconded somewhere.	183.1684056623006
The coffin they brought over was full of stones.	52.13283316471092
He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	40.11412351750617
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	22.146838174812864
And so forth and so on.	100.99173685865969
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	9.495026461923059
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	12.03895392823489
Something evidently riled them in his death.	43.47071920216642
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	8.683447176759119
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	9.525034988575548
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	9.43807388261442
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	12.822456433746728
And the identical same with murderers.	110.09156584002926
You had to come back.	173.77038016013972
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	54.09015902637716
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	56.498537897111824
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	9.825806327007854
Still as regards return.	140.811462004924
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	20.20709727234761
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	25.834708251219297
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	9.472462053141285
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	13.305058153426254
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	35.31623295161053
She put the first nail in his coffin.	24.299355746937227
— Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi - disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	20.08267979464476
She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	107.80167433741585
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	47.39152607679502
The husband was a captain or an officer.	83.2233814680901
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	108.18540850815225
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	19.591256801190458
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	9.98784456487258
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	9.125690219662436
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	8.635905241637833
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	8.972047472848828
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	18.268782964607794
Poser.	3279.475308279624
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	13.039534365027489
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	8.47645004195593
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	19.104368207103153
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	19.994133542253323
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	12.569841759948975
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	9.79303420619746
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	19.4750400859435
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	66.18664019931276
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	13.739348449611617
— Was she?	1159.3024290614176
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	26.599183561676085
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	29.75046079761603
So, Spain.	665.1733830327281
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	11.250708308270502
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	22.33344417652131
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	9.200107214538587
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	10.678222926802347
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	34.79334835646407
Taken a few years since.	72.82237374211775
In or about ninety six.	249.14295083831692
Very like her then.	79.71888887361885
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	8.611040510548483
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	10.314172272152241
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	23.046457262934393
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	11.506327182120929
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	19.05511760278557
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	27.820085045002624
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	19.28299016057313
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	10.283708605043394
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	58.54292427743526
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	12.389175925311745
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	14.631545959783262
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	10.456595179329113
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	14.454525804267606
Suppose she was gone when he?	38.28464925426797
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	10.533293964679233
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	13.560642301719872
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	13.881442412336082
And why not?	556.9197402181511
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	9.315032064712506
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	11.028609463054996
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	8.770734010521021
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	9.621917678723857
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	10.471701106511158
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	8.95630171913719
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	8.377767099725336
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	8.808747784930935
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	9.84234263415265
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	8.82262626962455
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	18.712875041397428
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	11.644308033231756
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	76.81011964228925
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	30.105639603569607
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	144.55732607067796
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	47.406483361384524
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	38.44965616942778
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	11.551997050158608
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	11.045863596502953
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	7.792062496204297
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	13.286916520345267
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	14.013313513271898
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	13.877990745425716
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	23.484264551624292
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	9.75722400186131
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	9.787548569897773
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	8.46609086680624
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	17.24732883132869
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	13.2611948560297
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	83.2233814680901
Your god was a jew.	76.16604259547216
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	16.882880470212303
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	19.407624364176762
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	37.19705243368989
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	68.91757610755784
Do you like cocoa?	141.17446319662227
Wait.	365.9458717894147
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	76.37276223994074
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	13.034872865086783
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	24.717099009151504
An opening was all was wanted.	167.27507064270895
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	11.892919313947703
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	15.20002819919338
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	13.656561435889465
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	52.610612439500905
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	19.38761274827325
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	132.95331474873453
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	11.566104332803562
— Are you bad in the eyes?	131.1393012915035
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	46.8902396713437
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	13.507060338549715
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	60.151929559078155
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	23.05874694518684
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	8.395435832141542
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	8.81781621013392
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	55.005034816404105
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	10.626978858455324
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	19.318582050651916
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	16.764186516538313
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	20.268054493045394
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	16.20003324689059
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	13.809840037133592
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	20.386574796118207
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	23.754813403663764
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	29.059019458714822
Come.	429.0937688930336
It ’ s not far.	80.47490583108001
Lean on me.	165.49959036625415
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	18.36164452686235
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	18.256971662730567
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	25.254697342538126
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	12.00697986840636
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	11.308301556329656
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	12.952577043921497
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	9.304062788732724
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	12.982351058316967
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	9.743002798218798
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	11.575694399371816
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	12.407946174795315
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	9.998954586341393
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	10.423218393548007
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	10.66400466016115
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	10.771907883078162
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	17.15707130498926
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	10.795911929114203
Beware of the steamroller.	98.27978219799586
They thereupon stopped.	859.7656663119578
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	10.171505068045521
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	31.317394938339202
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	15.659902834814513
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	12.612535891772962
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	9.461958014660244
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	12.873810406574316
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	10.795829348302295
— What ’ s this I was saying?	103.45032532020846
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	10.710447135637773
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	11.624439691718688
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	10.848902703322276
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	13.66016889117477
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	10.645707056082793
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	27.940517896863163
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	19.193092344634323
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	9.257429160498392
A.	19938.206404913133
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	9.68863604155138
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	12.917146345776553
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	12.020654417974836
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	9.235258389136135
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	8.976072887853137
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	9.80433340780634
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	10.077906393197578
The horse was just then.	160.8539767362668
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	9.350887942991688
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	12.189165718241922
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	22.600679292090927
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	22.65024817297832
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	10.33211706779636
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	154.27744248794457
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	11.86963411022274
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	9.014463175665442
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	65.2219584920093
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	9.564801453053247
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	13.352355361041734
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	27.161042949310428
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	9.079638067754253
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	17.899935278359774
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	17.697874828394912
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	14.313621942577024
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	11.868184473889938
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	21.73985522028487
Were their views on some points divergent?	128.3536029994912
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	15.27784679302065
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	10.051069146468521
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	10.742242697139318
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	45.22237599816467
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	36.3565181334551
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	21.760001581830455
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	10.937696945825222
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	11.105039308854858
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	12.28418327566768
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	12.156593373528393
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	11.407277970385984
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	21.418531843067967
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	16.84871159932568
As in what ways?	154.03048215794817
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	11.189695622545594
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	14.931913356956821
Was it there?	133.06974488137942
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	15.277277173822219
Why was he doubly irritated?	65.70299985509912
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	14.91922625891536
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	22.44074104389651
To enter or not to enter.	157.63605781720287
To knock or not to knock.	157.63605781720287
Bloom ’ s decision?	55.1876459135498
A stratagem.	2298.027198408115
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	9.365122251078052
Did he fall?	149.46206376294165
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	8.311185650679338
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	48.07087698132908
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	65.2219584920093
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	10.831406153567944
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	67.50703012933384
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	12.890417389651857
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	109.1343468108211
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	21.01661997032099
Did Stephen obey his sign?	73.94887096824571
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	12.713291713629909
What did Bloom do?	848.0323231941626
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	8.778872716707664
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	46.49398731421216
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	8.536748535080257
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	28.701339442268555
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	9.872722388027398
What did Bloom see on the range?	221.45883999249804
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	18.141042824899845
What did Bloom do at the range?	173.46363223027205
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	14.514755876880605
Yes.	2652.1488126418053
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	8.46501754411616
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	8.5029497740213
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	22.453308714255027
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	7.53486274827444
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	9.240611129886906
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	10.663686770985953
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	46.52508423376639
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	9.699728093066847
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	10.395939393655302
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	55.42059883550668
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	65.20442108820676
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	11.75996596525441
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	18.86002101604896
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	24.649111540024546
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	32.05512219429907
The phenomenon of ebullition.	423.1963682690693
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	9.431621772501627
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	8.51547572970462
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	65.2219584920093
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	28.1297777275623
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	21.762568404094644
To shave himself.	999.4673397598074
What advantages attended shaving by night?	112.88758446016223
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	8.739411634845267
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	75.63292508005894
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	16.045737275516196
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	32.83945319395794
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	14.291925232052211
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	21.756907531825036
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	10.84679081764105
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	25.905159066247517
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	46.52508423376639
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	17.262844225544235
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	112.88758446016223
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	11.027767285609015
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	29.67728023415457
In Bernard Kiernan ’ s licensed premises <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street: in David Byrne ’ s licensed premises, <NUM> Duke street: in O ’ Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon ’ s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	11.25806494744349
W.	802.6102002844123
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	19.537806783222546
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	10.110958432473572
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	148.59060056533409
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	12.064745794394945
His mood?	2903.4841098907514
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	22.01713665366511
What satisfied him?	909.2971776400653
To have sustained no positive loss.	157.63605781720287
Light to the gentiles.	73.16422510501177
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	32.8283012340302
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	11.45861983103827
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	40.74294388821513
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	10.179603926758116
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	28.951542975166817
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	15.348479762035511
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	11.690995532620846
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	20.92676225056046
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	18.20008667940794
Who drank more quickly?	451.92301940532735
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	11.098741280207015
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	148.59060056533409
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	10.130220279098031
Had he found their solution?	51.871383249796246
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	14.720756119807055
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	11.94949383436478
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you ’ ll find room.	23.877557967298458
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	16.57892194562005
Bloom.	3062.7862855312187
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	18.272279080528254
Name, age, race, creed.	50.625324923741374
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	54.31599305085694
Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob Bollopedoom Old Ollebo, M.	27.825353863157748
P.	3451.7979164444014
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the <NUM> February <NUM>?	16.84051735222213
Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	26.898613627813717
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	35.03031320823292
Dearer far than song or wine.	54.58606516877998
You are mine.	367.0657304193344
The world is mine.	293.36956372985276
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	30.322637937467494
G.	831.2657542937562
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	9.6883427645997
Shelton <NUM> December <NUM>, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.	23.84668947180585
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?	10.865676101185842
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born <NUM>, acceded <NUM>) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist ’ s non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist ’ s revelations of white articles of non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody ’ s Book of Jokes_ (<NUM> pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	7.860683071050006
What relation existed between their ages?	148.59060056533409
<NUM> years before in <NUM> when Bloom was of Stephen ’ s present age Stephen was <NUM>.	27.725564861416423
<NUM> years after in <NUM> when Stephen would be of Bloom ’ s present age Bloom would be <NUM>.	24.403056269625168
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	14.73479519261318
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	33.801149030060095
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	10.248228563381794
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin ’ s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s father and Stephen ’ s granduncle, Stephen being then <NUM> years older.	13.798513218266027
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	16.354842428021477
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	13.561361661900355
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	21.019270619251177
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	9.249228812512829
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	22.073508475795652
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	9.479530215714165
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	44.21875315133634
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	9.492523341213976
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	40.74294388821513
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	11.023046555104619
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	12.127701369680407
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	10.068342819838199
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	32.44568392092352
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	9.908700082172874
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	45.916455814086426
Neither.	1330.846217134227
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen?	14.750405465334577
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	21.217892945055535
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?	28.793212100440915

Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	15.520509125967337
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?	16.039774140766465
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	35.51616066251867
A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O ’ Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	10.998104994354303

Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C.	59.70947263108059
C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	20.03718137492986
Did they find their educational careers similar?	56.36207971556448
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame ’ s school and the high school.	16.72212496570961
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	10.836239610648885
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	49.181244936375805
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	12.79128562791503
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	83.21830810566979
The scientific.	3231.5631710819375
The artistic.	3231.5631710819375
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	21.756907531825036
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	9.692019647406644
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	53.030877388781505
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	50.85309072312575
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	13.182505052604245
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	106.2437684618236
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	55.42059883550668
James, the former by his <NUM> d bazaar at <NUM> George ’ s street, south, the latter at his <NUM> / <NUM> d shop and world ’ s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at <NUM> Henry street, admission <NUM> d, children <NUM> d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.	8.55342821683448

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?	12.337084476401028
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.	15.004062159332756
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?	65.2044210882067
Solitary hotel in mountain pass.	88.18344478206103

What?	2342.5114089148965
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel.	27.286056598615904
Queen ’ s Ho...	50.40191784567241
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	65.2044210882067
The Queen ’ s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the <NUM> June <NUM>, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of <NUM> parts of aconite liniment to <NUM> of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at <URL> <URL>. on the morning of <NUM> June <NUM> at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, <NUM> Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at <URL> <URL>. on the afternoon of <NUM> June <NUM> a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, <NUM> Main street, Ennis.	8.996026371907453
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	23.231724533590253
Coincidence.	808.5262989580134
He preferred himself to see another ’ s face and listen to another ’ s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	18.058007118794606
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	11.72121655456428
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	8.184317348556077
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise <URL> <URL>., sunset <URL> <URL>. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	11.836745904687637
What to do with our wives.	148.59060056533409
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	78.65831456268673
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	8.088149242532904
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	22.453308714255027
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	17.040179975103136
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	16.116362834599443
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	31.187273817916683
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	37.795167972500046
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	12.407165718636419
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	12.553785600814189
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	19.854735695772018
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	25.885858397264805
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	31.74760752298224
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	30.90770069510389
Variously.	3279.475308279624
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other ’ s ignorant lapse.	10.937096905558837
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	24.619159721588755
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	13.284256931602155
What system had proved more effective?	148.59060056533409
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	154.27744248794457
Example?	3279.475308279624
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	14.213664063653061
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest ’ s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	18.797607466531996
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	10.081506563921309
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	15.818755968492537
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	17.789127983434504
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?	28.2990920694476
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	13.195911611215232
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?	15.089155797865715
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	11.359879323847883
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m ’ baad l ’ zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	12.595487918073854
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	16.028076925866653
By juxtaposition.	596.2004614447528
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, and <NUM>.	9.431632445597618
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	17.89258256137247
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	20.10486406634645
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	30.04910080314597
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar <NUM> years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	8.546840910379004
Mary ’ s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve ’ s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	10.256872335717631
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	45.42570298685798
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	22.960131535849687
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	28.748109686640372
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	33.9751274550159
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	45.84604165317112
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	12.973264504902712
Did the guest comply with his host ’ s request?	26.65551788410379
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	29.75046079761603
What was Stephen ’ s auditive sensation?	94.63675353552703
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	24.651010745030888
What was Bloom ’ s visual sensation?	87.62177695150929
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	27.923198974319654
What were Stephen ’ s and Bloom ’ s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	26.69437435777098
Visually, Stephen ’ s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	13.587118488412095
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	30.04910080314597
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.	22.243996373960144

C., Rufus Isaacs, K.	40.626646660058285
C.	417.9052384715969
On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († <NUM>), exponent of Shakespeare.	16.445012338240883
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	15.775559098676455
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	11.010916958256768
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	25.121786637262968
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	20.75953806464367
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	21.704208965326334
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew ’ s windows all.	22.322808494968577
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	22.854645731984544
With unmixed feeling.	1018.4834758819296
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	21.346692336730378
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	27.86044346574022
Then out there came the jew ’ s daughter And she all dressed in green.	30.28952252743785
“ Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again. ” I can ’ t come back and I won ’ t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	13.3118362758652
For if my master he did hear He ’ d make it a sorry ball. ” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	11.01472629364169
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	14.907995575110142
And now he ’ ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	23.350061827893526
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	22.854645731984544
With mixed feelings.	1018.4834758819296
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew ’ s daughter, all dressed in green.	20.84626863414333
Condense Stephen ’ s commentary.	99.69176780614801
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	40.68263567407734
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	21.192335908144518
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	13.728772882443511
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	15.412155096913411
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	22.24282310924331
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	19.27921242401741
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	20.26084047214785
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	62.56844047357125
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	22.24282310924331
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	10.882783993655874
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	18.472389084886238
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	12.638289596637517
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	11.232364865665934
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	19.92172835466335
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	10.457233413951505
What other infantile memories had he of her?	69.88436816238185
<NUM> June <NUM>.	1235.5882993692317
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	42.67779103330059
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	9.58784261013059
What endemic characteristics were present?	228.72009114248254
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	12.256663316386314
What memories had he of her adolescence?	114.74961682381185
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	69.07909524420315
On the duke ’ s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	15.151483485989871
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	13.867606631337097
On the vigil of the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).	14.026017632626356
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	27.105864000089564
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	29.75046079761603
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	40.74294388821513
A temporary departure of his cat.	129.14506950814115
Why similarly, why differently?	269.4092412422492
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	22.835668072001415
In other respects were their differences similar?	113.55165512604025
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	35.60089515337873
As?	919.8053777550354
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	16.704999938740684
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	10.855847988380347
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	9.238669865100276
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	14.760646226011177
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	13.958841044978804
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	8.615102931712542
In what manners did she reciprocate?	91.51448715938722
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	22.241223535741675
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	15.38092818558229
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	13.486544384183887
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	24.281573856491654
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	13.04486403995118
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	30.04910080314597
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	26.33633576891144
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	20.35187280130261
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	15.132395761056667
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	16.46965102407096
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	28.507445634174132
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, <NUM> October <NUM>.	13.42473484153923
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?	54.31599305085694
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), <NUM> June <NUM>, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	14.086730932648472
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	97.1480371872388
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	29.75046079761603
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	54.31599305085694
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ <NUM> <NUM>), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	14.862774377984337
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	19.854735695772018
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	27.447135741287887
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	29.82655285377991
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, <NUM> Lower Abbey street (W.	12.56348354903828
and E.	397.7492601160932
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	9.512884176328711
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	40.74294388821513
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	10.234986582044904
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	12.598897724738045
and T.	193.04633723199225
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	13.155823250998594
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	72.82031053232075
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	63.522627610213554
Never.	16408.7029153328
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	72.38431876830028
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	14.43939939323375
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	31.93726578872352
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	8.406495343752534
Why did he desist from speculation?	109.95764361055681
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	12.948335106666516
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	55.32420300708078
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	178.3479151315861
Not verbally.	598.7620097582651
Substantially.	3279.475308279624
What comforted his misapprehension?	406.4947603129262
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	15.414152699806706
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	17.417311322852562
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	15.58389379722583
What did each do at the door of egress?	136.97842454601104
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	112.61865026808879
Stephen put the hat on his head.	136.18761716013339
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	22.86716322474724
For a cat.	157.0896328114086
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	13.507171511069666
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	66.67026609741337
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	15.57205583598871
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	8.405253701259076
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	24.425271569858083
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	8.369786140020137
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	29.31782806309604
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	10.037647764481067
Of a different order of difficulty.	51.93097103496561
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	8.169353102257043
And the problem of possible redemption?	110.09156584002926
The minor was proved by the major.	109.1343468108211
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	23.94570298636672
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	8.697666758411716
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	8.311447230314092
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	24.999245375079237
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	16.620991439362342
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	9.026087860268161
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	42.27522681969999
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	12.104918989580645
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	16.08862922654087
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	9.881223990949472
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	36.31635715284602
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	8.073100468645734
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	31.879132524865444
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	11.146521538514065
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	12.846055570327726
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	19.508828658595416
Both then were silent?	78.18476899752669
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	17.79339618231513
Were they indefinitely inactive?	539.7738591925515
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	11.469488948362411
Similarly?	3279.475308279624
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	9.45126074381113
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	27.76847191899864
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	23.446532159770932
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	10.178909277066422
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	81.23686769253887
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	13.393749888635993
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	20.924419435210638
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	9.753890395112863
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	22.989576230692485
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	10.97868956476878
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	22.453308714255027
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	23.274174893974624
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	46.52508423376639
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	65.83525073824565
Turma circumdet.	345.2276592150924
Iubilantium te virginum.	134.29611024360622
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	26.26844278591473
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	14.63798204975725
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	12.737753899773109
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	54.58606516877998
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	20.772129546932455
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	54.58606516877998
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	14.548564996902615
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	20.470547287619535
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	11.946440366197118
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	11.914369924562811
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	65.2219584920093
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	23.9680560164085
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	25.370911588878077
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	11.205674185536395
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	173.66933671006979
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	9.898359846128766
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	26.658817931109372
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	21.37829633740545
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	228.72009114248254
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	11.758689348353421
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	22.989666103795667
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	9.168640212702378
Describe them.	410.5471886343227
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	9.885496414163658
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	11.190596855578653
What significances attached to these two chairs?	106.2437684618236
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	19.05511760278557
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	69.46406572773763
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies ’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	10.294973803128904

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	20.084503689364194
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	9.467577218578356
His next proceeding?	875.9829679545652
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	8.431803693532425
What followed this operation?	281.7916207060944
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	21.99714625508073
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?	36.31635715284602
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?	40.74294388821513
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	18.4562768328072
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	10.24939021121643
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	46.52508423376639
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	40.479431383452585
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	297.45191814238586
Brothers and sisters had he none.	51.232820204380715
Yet that man ’ s father was his grandfather ’ s son.	23.169662334530614
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	297.45191814238586
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	31.856243881929508
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.	28.43018193875286
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	49.073080555227904
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.	17.34497431451871

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?	32.83945319395794
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.	10.443069246172566

Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?	27.887450867605764

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.	8.30143314789787
Why with satisfaction?	1143.5556020880456

What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?	40.74294388821513
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown.	10.288433717186996
Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.	8.19937573896063

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?	24.575914594682676
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	155.0239972896007
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.	21.622070777616145
As?	919.8053777550354
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	11.757877496959622
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	30.669986398153707
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.	17.38497481100714
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?	51.760620638105515
Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	9.564801453053247
Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	10.201278934512212
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	19.12578930331574
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.	15.319860140715342
What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?	54.31599305085694
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.	30.06571936269872
Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate.	20.580976268150902
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.	13.922474095588829
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	65.20442108820676
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.	47.39778885945854
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	81.23686769253887
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.	30.479185418005407
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.	12.652154433793626

Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying <NUM> d in the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff ’ s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella.	9.985379695661875
Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.	26.898613627813717
With which attendant indignities?	446.7813870930605
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	11.359588889461106
By what could such a situation be precluded?	33.9751274550159
By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).	20.47824276659177
Which preferably?	260.6644359039638
The latter, by the line of least resistance.	66.67026609741337
What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?	83.21830810566972
Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.	45.42570298685798

The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.	40.023485582474464
What considerations rendered departure not irrational?	112.88758446016213
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.	11.13443067929848

Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	54.97678725535651
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events.	10.606006113653143
Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall.	16.497326805856883
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.	9.847018673177827
What would render such return irrational?	112.88758446016223

What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?	46.52508423376639
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.	10.053104996760268

Bloom ’ s acts?	55.1876459135498
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	10.733953076236238
How?	946.9368407841936
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	9.494970521369572
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	101.21511231068462
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	10.17890681308756
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	24.656240994951272
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	10.628824061047938
What preceding series?	909.2971776400653
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	9.245862953069533
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	36.19792539115555
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	13.375218428393913
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	32.14484357237163
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	9.514882264580832
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	22.031721460052612
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	43.62316795256754
Envy?	1575.979671522145
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	10.223082077209515
Jealousy?	3279.475308279624
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	17.575426848767528
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	12.53262536663589
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	14.564708998029282
Abnegation?	3279.475308279624
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	9.64624726108835
Equanimity?	3279.475308279624
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	11.756991619929666
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	15.883485735320722
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	8.814465054428954
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	10.387022437708566
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	71.7637509286302
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	59.7595738551068
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	11.311461394389314
What retribution, if any?	228.72009114248254
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	26.898613627813717
Duel by combat, no.	99.69176780614801
Divorce, not now.	154.27744248794457
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	17.381480408588143
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	16.11036383964698
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	71.85002890012079
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	10.35515531709789
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	14.638947697794448
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	8.461480945441604
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	20.707503223556362
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	9.59300462426017
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	172.94128814290212
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	23.98269120112642
Then?	23828.37119282554
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	15.569551961089484
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	172.94128814290212
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	21.731846235944744
What followed this silent action?	167.07437661148498
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.	26.898613627813717

Absolutely.	1575.979671522145

<NUM> October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born <NUM> June <NUM>, having been anticipatorily consummated on the <NUM> September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place <NUM> weeks previous, viz.	12.023894549189512
<NUM> November <NUM>, to the birth on <NUM> December <NUM> of second (and only male) issue, deceased <NUM> January <NUM>, aged <NUM> days, there remained a period of <NUM> years, <NUM> months and <NUM> days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.	11.451558570236296
By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, <NUM> September <NUM>, there remained a period of <NUM> months and <NUM> day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	9.170050930400079
How?	946.9368407841936
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.	11.604808818695536
What moved visibly above the listener ’ s and the narrator ’ s invisible thoughts?	32.05512219429907

• Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that

damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were <NUM> of us goodbye to my sleep for this

wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb pots of mixed plum and

and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and

Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only <NUM> or <NUM> Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM> st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day

I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at <NUM> <NUM> d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar <NUM> d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	7.448348690893961
