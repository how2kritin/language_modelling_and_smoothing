1059.6696032673074
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	1061.70845926817
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	413.02416215600635
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	699.1512234994797
You saved men from drowning.	823.2342561452417
The scrotumtightening sea.	654.0562366831705
There is something sinister in you....	160.77663208740825
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	1716.518843243762
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	1602.2861954827156
Buck Mulligan answered.	409.4480020214281
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	636.890783923816
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	603.145501324143
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	594.9661192687072
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	625.7326772879611
A servant too.	327.7515931329288
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	543.9438916054063
he said.	56.271385512740096
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	828.840203416337
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	510.18728373643097
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	400.9175322057618
What did you say that for?	260.60417449649844
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	1028.3942160796662
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	463.5936026528488
Brief exposure.	1694.178082865129
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	1577.8356562193424
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	467.7355111863728
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	679.4268882322644
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	456.6147417541573
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	366.02194202866264
— Go on then, Talbot.	287.20058291537055
My father gave me seeds to sow.	1025.7520609310448
Ask me, sir.	229.54937383954854
— Again, sir.	199.36020142045913
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	365.2535772128995
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	938.7632233748342
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	635.4176841433339
Mr Deasy is calling you.	390.36400594338835
— What is it now?	201.6861698196797
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	652.4078545538116
Money is power.	568.2897646233121
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	766.3797779695716
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	519.8646141394785
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	932.7319729632414
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	466.30308384441855
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	1565.6010010394307
Serum and virus.	1125.1757113011208
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	576.8206028575553
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	1580.2143896114285
I am, a stride at a time.	210.95347997008645
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	560.8139498468039
Yes, I must.	121.27633811348662
Lump of love.	406.58473087159916
It lowers.	585.1907826725566
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	456.53163198879855
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	752.6099457331056
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	3055.218376715376
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	440.70428742551303
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	2619.7412701857734
_Fermé_.	456.4876166053903
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	421.442312164725
She serves me at his beck.	680.6320844966526
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	1095.7044195764618
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	1279.7677356329177
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	464.3743733567982
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	576.713257419084
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	453.6475780193581
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	881.636864967753
Open hallway.	822.5095190379079
In. Come.	120.44077051401834
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	2826.015983499612
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	615.572071364367
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	742.4458474906658
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	844.0121528226985
Welcome as the flowers in May.	556.3695929408204
My ashplant will float away.	1112.837101889745
I shall wait.	264.44521321012513
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	408.1253320944402
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	1219.0026555689283
The coals were reddening.	953.3409624424298
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	289.3971768831894
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	535.4273905151148
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	1554.946651584127
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	738.3060497466923
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	926.3647605684667
Not there.	151.18835758937678
Makes you feel young.	548.1041347541794
Getting on to sundown.	618.0456910241819
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	924.010958562905
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	917.9381962745194
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	2302.814117856124
For you, please?	271.5570892886732
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	819.454789467797
Still an idea behind it.	422.31246097990487
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	455.9058103403318
Yes, yes.	119.92320578449333
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	1595.7535949390046
Here.	114.12190415134765
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	1559.8415676332868
Only five she was then.	362.6922405323801
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	269.94862420600776
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	524.1056274191677
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	492.2724886026548
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	1258.081628141989
C.	105.94139119590463
— Here, she said.	130.82563213979378
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	212.16754017848035
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	885.5805068498006
Illustration.	456.4876166053903
An example?	709.5159105578693
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	339.67711396449016
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	481.29950245963335
Byby.	287.5691785887357
Of course it might.	342.6959185198472
Vain: very.	381.39142246172634
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	703.0829224871709
Useless: can ’ t move.	494.2850150283301
Virginia creepers.	1820.5128270013201
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	1175.8524090706412
Nobody.	251.21481667538362
Invent a story for some proverb.	1154.096979589033
<URL>.	71.1586486131209
Her head dancing.	499.587898698926
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	669.7500951110526
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	552.6686133854744
Singing with his eyes shut.	494.70936392171336
In the dark.	126.48731472224769
No - one.	203.50602773831434
Eyes front.	573.7935486457147
Hair?	571.5312739659532

I see you ’ re...	92.07005630230313
Having a wet.	420.3053312296557
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	656.9045747474321
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	321.9006856962299
Like to see her again in that.	197.60225494948506
Rachel, is it?	277.5442922452689
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	542.8857159223068
Ruins and tenements.	979.5223492803078
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	1985.2893023659058
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	916.2148273783068
I feel so bad about.	314.04521178223547

Perfectly right that is.	341.587662726791
Palestrina for example too.	799.4545964390559
Eunuch.	316.5108355747976

Where is this?	290.8025110264411
Aq. Dist.	885.7305153020416
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	2134.6396201001085
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	180.61348962767715
How much are they?	413.25285149750454
To look younger.	550.1677376832331
Regular hotbed of it lately.	1175.4912080666957
College sports today I see.	800.4581960988857
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	906.9106406262749
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	2164.2479577763975
He was alone.	160.21575890279266
Great card he was.	311.91081111199185
His name stinks all over Dublin.	704.1425149668219
Mr Power asked.	269.8404443766768
Gasworks.	456.4876166053903
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	1893.2346346077597
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	875.927895231017
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	275.9731289667961
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	1018.7998650422454
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	249.66940266935086
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	220.3901709311792
What causes that?	446.66065637907235
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	2796.709636847692
And _Madame_.	377.13234872753924
Or the Moira, was it?	267.81804938079324
— About the boatman?	513.3428470133321
Mr Power asked.	269.8404443766768
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	138.4556051241054
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	371.99420428752603
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	711.7676844038166
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	240.09112573096982
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	563.88784416559
Very encouraging.	743.2212493908235
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	620.2911344461189
— What ’ s wrong now?	273.1443081686761
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	473.68252072577917
— Why?	189.1476710358997
Terrible! — First round Dunphy ’ s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	529.1522574810493
Elixir of life.	382.70742840555573
How she met her death.	410.2192717965052

Ned Lambert says he ’ ll try to get one of the girls into Todd ’ s.	492.80171281494864
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	550.0986860152639
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	891.3854157279202
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	579.9090358970717
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	861.8940516961527
Eh?	348.78337379607075
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	653.4087606511329
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	171.14522678170573
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	1910.7215561338596

— L, Mr Bloom said.	175.01227805159715
And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	416.7918538217305
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	248.44698025685153
We have time.	202.4102547006549
More interesting if they told you what they were.	601.8848627587143

Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	1421.0185348607606
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	1921.9664542137352
Way out.	263.8437608081264

This ad, you see.	259.74695953004675
Then here the name.	191.15361493888096

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	3619.8578505940086
a voice asked from the castingbox.	354.3303029600537
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	909.8154912271284
How quickly he does that job.	476.77595274404143
Pop in a minute to phone.	714.9898055645601
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	921.1472923195892
Bladderbags.	456.4876166053903

_ — That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... _ — O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	1151.2028785724751
No, twenty...	88.09590062427952

It was at the royal university dinner.	530.9110363763353
— I escort a suppliant, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said melodiously.	880.0231439322703
Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now.	1366.9050456537245

The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen ’ s and Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s loose ties.	584.9350346014329
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	467.7558162144037

He looked towards the saloon door.	500.70309157648194
And blind too, poor fellow.	339.2707052232491
Third time.	423.0290706672177
Does that to all.	185.65550662334726
Wire in yet?	829.9693033804134
O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	1039.331192560477
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	1254.4525709019094
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	319.55130357040605
Clock whirred.	1197.9648109315572
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	1469.1886121896425
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	1155.2482322704898
I was only vamping, man.	297.899899490272
His gouty paws plumped chords.	3474.7625055530684
What?	128.2987952047132
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: — _When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	3173.6498187167813
No trouble.	259.2938253184464

He went.	113.0923730041969
It certainly is.	265.4633518011367
It ’ s so characteristic.	301.6296734025926
One plus two plus six is seven.	1587.7846578270883
Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl.	331.42176497268554

Big ships ’ chandler ’ s business he did once.	861.1858220052491
George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin.	2226.2811025321103
Blank face.	620.7058139610474
They want it.	177.48095086238567

For him then not for.	206.3492547561702

Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.	1632.8570973094065

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	862.0190174659417
Look at this, says he.	185.6777779283252
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	507.5260998204638
And he started laughing.	404.01695369740366
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	590.9959533937712
says I.	71.09709925223822
The tear is bloody near your eye.	629.6263724431793
— _...	34.42667701617272
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	210.2730339730256
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	545.587328113986
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	1411.4533847020907
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	599.1821260582379
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	3603.538090117283
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	2993.486889133285
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	2581.711436124945
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	1392.9206557962857
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	891.5149393994378
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	1000.2351899049308
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	190.96490566059148
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	883.5904808990746
True as you ’ re there.	320.34968347515417

— Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.	584.2141618239386
Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	453.62393193760107
That ’ s well known.	261.3875764940716

— Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	546.448836343939
It was a knockout clean and clever.	687.984604701004
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	420.06146852993896
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	577.1764978717638
J.	78.32022695006061
Look at his head.	230.32246932051746
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	190.26536581894257
What?	128.2987952047132
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	723.8913127550696
And J.	132.31461027851512
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	1896.3444254179028
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	1049.478621784182
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	989.5235401793001
— Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	299.44596459796287
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	2543.3421817855938
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	703.8474537231785

There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	1319.7223587610013
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	940.2532835276481
— That covers my case, says Joe.	427.7854051142896
I was born here.	191.6250906596774
— And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	429.1597965086897
Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.	24736.27786749841

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	485.5134157751761
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	893.9429951603904
— Who made those allegations?	980.1273976348249

J., when he ’ s quite sure which country it is.	248.7291296413131

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	2122.4385240155366
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	711.1813688639628

Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	932.8453875453379
— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	859.7055914155802
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	1298.495363544651
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	1069.6862054089456
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	1716.2403523450132
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	1416.7458808851986
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	1356.3090410280877
The colours were done something lovely.	745.0283247344329
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	1071.1907667465878
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	1130.120020046469
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	1298.3572921482291
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	3100.9393100992547
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	637.6115051087812
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	399.5860984642395
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	981.4154490634921
Sister?	439.43951449902175
Cheap too.	379.3047584731394
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	522.7017824358187
And I ’ ll write to you.	188.81216833535686
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	1336.514104621748

Took off her hat to show her hair.	605.2455462454416
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she ’ s on for it: good evening.	339.2556610621456
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	798.4176943795396
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	664.0476159450305
Cause of half the trouble.	417.67496362374663
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	416.6317536606555
Fifteen she told me.	425.529132431526
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	426.6274706573637
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	983.7023310895606
Neat way she carries parcels too.	1770.1527617454947
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	4423.231641363989
Keeps them out of harm ’ s way.	390.8018727265188
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	929.9215223947865
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	1174.9476826362545
Big he and little she.	213.1950500574067
Tip.	316.5108355747976
For instance if you go into a cellar where it ’ s dark.	572.172688513916
Vamp of her stockings.	505.70181022454216
Wonder where it is really.	394.7236202372829
Animals go by that.	442.59443692605396
Ask yourself who is he now.	477.0911144299444
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	564.9673890332288
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	961.6196308809614
Old Betty ’ s joints are on the rack.	923.7656130833523
And distant hills seem coming nigh.	2372.137876816048
Bailey light.	574.2663908669834
No. Wait.	131.52411295712042
All quiet on Howth now.	573.6868252446069
O wait.	182.7992444499987
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	493.70446931698484
Bat probably.	875.8445868638984
Their frugal meal.	2132.264801606789
Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.	1183.0106215228097
Say you never see them with three colours.	615.4282537887576
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	827.0537189098192
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	942.9490146328028

Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion.	918.9909602811599
Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	591.59935447395
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	1141.866255209114
Hopeless.	362.3144614049264
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	640.8924197553307
Might be money.	354.06077117435945
Must come back.	310.93627713524756
What?	128.2987952047132
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	850.586053384023
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	1102.7476492928768
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	864.1543663250937
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	2062.907418485471
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	771.7193209629838
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	1062.9787499903616
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	1559.1111313630836
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	979.6928363357798

Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	621.5920076384033
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	3619.5896435191976
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.	1432.0788062011663
The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice.	878.7069641442923
