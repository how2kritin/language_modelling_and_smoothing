15575.568999464234
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	15582.276888573115
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	8665.321163544028
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	13252.68736056304
You saved men from drowning.	13703.013050986267
The scrotumtightening sea.	5154.624332819237
There is something sinister in you....	2871.204921206045
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	14015.143834162998
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	19631.343069063096
Buck Mulligan answered.	2543.1776347483838
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	15670.437801099917
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	16884.97100951061
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	20726.25895565558
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	13558.397925337587
A servant too.	4195.504053408302
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	11598.75240904328
he said.	497.15978922676095
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	15059.005191836124
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	20300.174872838565
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	7251.9303738327835
What did you say that for?	6480.321245358372
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	20752.261253893077
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	9090.802313630964
Brief exposure.	37357.29393751545
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	24017.79286257378
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	16325.322887741264
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	8579.201479123518
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	3069.302548777702
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	10210.96649903482
— Go on then, Talbot.	6309.795351382438
My father gave me seeds to sow.	19213.351944966744
Ask me, sir.	3463.86044530569
— Again, sir.	2403.4369634384116
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	7614.727339629662
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	20657.921947422226
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	25409.397648020087
Mr Deasy is calling you.	6182.53778843933
— What is it now?	1650.2657466412836
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	17166.37135379721
Money is power.	18464.908365655545
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	13923.326605082968
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	9345.889129348758
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	18911.62933479897
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	9345.836525418968
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	30603.536194875625
Serum and virus.	36454.2157820986
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	7523.144905740419
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	21842.04463629415
I am, a stride at a time.	5136.327399016162
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	17293.734256328727
Yes, I must.	3013.013153472836
Lump of love.	15679.042500870217
It lowers.	9715.982011259934
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	11854.60114677541
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	12206.887339204834
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	31504.599891529728
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	21442.708369526503
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	26580.621374202092
_Fermé_.	38912.41266155108
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	15646.913844650397
She serves me at his beck.	16227.251538452952
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	24717.481094657935
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	35448.82746577974
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	9864.333353346054
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	22722.202211209802
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	19568.62780560825
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	14257.994040814627
Open hallway.	18679.777051730223
In. Come.	6531.489268724483
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	25484.13507480539
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	16975.97000725117
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	15264.961181992552
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	17432.54241893473
Welcome as the flowers in May.	35152.97688934358
My ashplant will float away.	11842.529932042655
I shall wait.	5529.908285822768
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	22641.975676735456
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	15251.772137762824
The coals were reddening.	11668.838309424802
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	6157.931411274456
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	12504.011570794339
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	17582.083764316936
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	16294.19238688885
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	21052.538382005663
Not there.	4157.350890821686
Makes you feel young.	18814.988422003084
Getting on to sundown.	26612.700460518394
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	13680.858012476758
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	7389.132781520599
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	22897.535572655725
For you, please?	17293.955515465153
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	13051.481464192895
Still an idea behind it.	7543.08478699085
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	7168.448899767444
Yes, yes.	1148.709928448512
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	28886.625663363393
Here.	1968.8314675885797
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	20500.834622191927
Only five she was then.	13477.676344803085
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	10815.690457348175
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	10898.554664255931
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	25557.612842559556
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	20216.352679379044
C.	957.8630399978279
— Here, she said.	1103.5520978556913
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	6972.779844285298
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	10158.2847427468
Illustration.	38912.41266155108
An example?	11759.605667964739
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	5475.185549290337
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	15109.00527172614
Byby.	30885.11384226274
Of course it might.	8530.445189024498
Vain: very.	29263.845276061093
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	18886.219253675365
Useless: can ’ t move.	14840.331661910148
Virginia creepers.	37357.29393751545
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	22573.297254324232
Nobody.	10295.660825818126
Invent a story for some proverb.	35142.49232369827
<URL>.	3967.952251916979
Her head dancing.	13388.4097857112
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	13580.602398767138
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	11486.520082358082
Singing with his eyes shut.	14227.842287584946
In the dark.	2231.7227594780293
No - one.	1574.3027984372911
Eyes front.	15708.113938117589
Hair?	22757.03484400469
no trouble I hope?	31956.473456969135
I see you ’ re...	1730.4309364199983
Having a wet.	20451.234782846674
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	19499.669633483714
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	3262.092181753389
Like to see her again in that.	7738.5761532033
Rachel, is it?	6710.114249634812
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	18421.579413456693
Ruins and tenements.	36454.2157820986
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	14921.300984000185

Perfectly right that is.	10246.386307737599
Palestrina for example too.	16521.657524573402
Eunuch.	38912.41266155108
Look down at her ring to find an excuse.	25451.745525237155
Hide her blushes.	29263.668217739516

Aq. Dist.	36454.2157820986
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	28936.51688751659
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	1286.5461716601487
How much are they?	6512.396791515092
To look younger.	12938.898863397617
Regular hotbed of it lately.	27456.752000146134
College sports today I see.	14398.0415643811
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	18786.6063105398
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	32112.666965019933
He was alone.	2802.2728660263842
Great card he was.	9737.945980249891
His name stinks all over Dublin.	10752.700303218211
Mr Power asked.	2137.352612831261
Gasworks.	38912.41266155108
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	23502.000331761443
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	22022.1766005536
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	3577.7166462325818
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	12857.255742282627
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	2177.64643993791
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	2309.7572253106773
What causes that?	5351.05533349668
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	14985.023952075735
And _Madame_.	8368.18734231833
Or the Moira, was it?	6219.132850614323
— About the boatman?	9234.427993479669
Mr Power asked.	2137.352612831261
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	361.3981324828253
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	6013.878287072023
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	10607.023432222048
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	13575.11183626438
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	6281.522690338521
Very encouraging.	18984.474054716124
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	20170.526551463794
— What ’ s wrong now?	1939.2803884890918
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	7513.559407165235
— Why?	1291.71792970544
Terrible! — First round Dunphy ’ s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	8251.445237284046

Ned Lambert says he ’ ll try to get one of the girls into Todd ’ s.	11327.199430793578
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	21025.576869350738
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	21608.89438530517
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	8851.980871792315
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	35870.65121431731
Eh?	3630.6576605291275
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	10049.664824133357
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	1652.6072567665758
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	31951.803282289522

— L, Mr Bloom said.	1380.2531346029164
And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	6644.080720244734
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	5135.384328280163
We have time.	3881.991821874926
More interesting if they told you what they were.	20768.390488662677

Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	22445.52720749105
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	21268.035781400682
Way out.	8907.74901188361

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	20508.375187773163
a voice asked from the castingbox.	24877.855781165592
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	14400.759382033519
How quickly he does that job.	11584.28920770877
Pop in a minute to phone.	27129.589312724354
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	19151.650113967113
Bladderbags.	38912.41266155108

— Well.	2161.9631667128697
_ — That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... _ — O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	17068.44678363528
No, twenty...	1892.697352881024
J.	306.21619418874246
It was at the royal university dinner.	8352.59720419713
— I escort a suppliant, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said melodiously.	6290.805121437688
Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now.	22852.232275015685

The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen ’ s and Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s loose ties.	11878.402643235682
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	15731.384153058932

In Mooney ’ s _en ville_ and in Mooney ’ s _sur <URL> He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.	22997.512422242446
He looked towards the saloon door.	7146.543364117957
And blind too, poor fellow.	8692.605677954036
Third time.	8198.805109069423

Wire in yet?	29263.845276061093
O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	23042.25910568981
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	29073.46592994802
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	6013.507172582028
Clock whirred.	22213.45185317501
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	22009.977314986892
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	23704.426879262155
I was only vamping, man.	4184.350959400836
His gouty paws plumped chords.	13059.306910239582
What?	572.8670519115202
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: — _When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	17325.204960826286

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	15128.819137907762
Look at this, says he.	3633.620127269745
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	13432.848807506622
And he started laughing.	4922.78017988397
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	9448.436287851006
says I.	1123.8704378869784
The tear is bloody near your eye.	10133.645110044616
— _...	884.518159562279
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	8366.978899822667
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	16776.735485998674
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	23731.351505031565
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	18170.87254019044
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	27858.34851331651
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	31034.520043746375
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	12637.386488585209
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	24603.792603907834
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	25293.68034528004
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	31540.96456263244
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	4997.274598723602
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	21961.69393622286
True as you ’ re there.	7666.116046753766

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	13912.62354117635
That ’ s well known.	3080.3770799139766

— Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	5703.475043788859
It was a knockout clean and clever.	8834.636548115648
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	10800.512768128685
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	21430.676010244297
J.	306.21619418874246
Look at his head.	4274.888761453288
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	2505.827189026314
What?	572.8670519115202
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	21346.703994946973
And J.	2327.4688962004625
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	25751.30506505633
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	17694.48174193438
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	17781.90911999514
— Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	6980.499918453674
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	21660.686633519086
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	21012.969350057323
Aren ’ t they trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay ’ s dinnerparty with perfidious Albion?	27306.858141576336
Firebrands of Europe and they always were.	25652.786836934574
There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	9748.24930991414
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	21793.032772173945
— That covers my case, says Joe.	3222.1330942448953
I was born here.	2587.7572769865806
— And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	10656.905615633474

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	16346.141563964413
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	15262.888502940024
— Who made those allegations?	7490.888022272522
says Alf.	1396.747688710013
J., when he ’ s quite sure which country it is.	5351.005268081453

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	21963.01527748741
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	17785.582028150482

Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	20584.177544373797
— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	14371.898622079265
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	7915.820739328709
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	22229.213948931443
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	21795.83387208251
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	26401.301368536388
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	23224.22299190123
The colours were done something lovely.	12100.945683672535
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	24604.57055777514
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	26082.409611689058
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	21813.304478339924
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	24964.61554796886
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	21406.601238077696
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	14302.369292656263
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	23078.779193173148
Sister?	8498.96645492669
Cheap too.	8258.74403682871
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	12199.30119296061
And I ’ ll write to you.	3218.6824420809894
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	21918.52323324663
All are.	3849.645683832305
Took off her hat to show her hair.	18289.891306042475
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she ’ s on for it: good evening.	20319.40451896407
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	30259.43602084919
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	13984.732463728638
Cause of half the trouble.	27445.147053605044
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	21225.289293870675
Fifteen she told me.	6174.073898834974
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	16529.638985049398
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	19947.590405744046
Neat way she carries parcels too.	18017.97482239757
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	20607.956034308885
Keeps them out of harm ’ s way.	13298.435074564446
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	21950.78195372378
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	22453.883421329105
Big he and little she.	16365.351788312177
Tip.	12971.327416137423
For instance if you go into a cellar where it ’ s dark.	12643.928734096664
Vamp of her stockings.	26627.285229358018
Wonder where it is really.	14067.12053147704
Animals go by that.	16547.862072797045
Ask yourself who is he now.	12070.789284891825
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	14511.982995553273
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	20664.25575564117
Old Betty ’ s joints are on the rack.	19557.43079923164
And distant hills seem coming nigh.	13985.56653186675
Bailey light.	21008.979982086646
No. Wait.	3352.8993143535877
All quiet on Howth now.	9173.175069108733
O wait.	4919.8041221994645
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	14164.3405981632
Bat probably.	16879.722095014244
Their frugal meal.	15139.945262173085
Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.	21019.281121470958
Say you never see them with three colours.	23431.5558045755
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	18123.426111182867
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	20728.086204112282
And says she and says he.	4401.477763224618
Calomel purge I got her for that.	16329.57455240581

Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion.	27576.621141724023
Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	21497.155674331087
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	16148.584910882562
Hopeless.	30885.11384226274
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	18638.482439419367
Might be money.	6486.524614252776
Must come back.	4765.934594027934
What?	572.8670519115202
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	14058.373761015955
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	12070.029222028428
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	26963.45212850726
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	27611.902368229956
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	16641.457367567247
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	23857.244227171737
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	30156.995250866716
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	27233.02872028279
He ’ ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that ’ s Irish, says he.	9684.224987672387
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	20534.61697475539
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	27679.121216359505
