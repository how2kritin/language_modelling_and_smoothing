12.929906610524947
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	8.611660095961764
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	7.729964717564156
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	6.288909949244782
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	8.018097312843139
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	6.923761699142496
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	8.688428592909856
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	7.009273957215912
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	8.889951700921518
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	11.329293163494615
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	7.4830250263043645
Slow music, please.	15.292433437729164
Shut your eyes, gents.	13.224222041972036
One moment.	18.78249917651693
Silence, all.	21.970688357341075
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	7.927299888606289
Chrysostomos.	49.786713264135244
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	8.772478546640638
That will do nicely.	14.630472918713448
Switch off the current, will you?	11.687453169498493
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	7.785146790794837
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	6.200583263269525
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	9.597068108341892
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	12.552763512278478
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	9.198674252763825
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	7.028447283724467
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	10.289265551596015
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	9.943406643094821
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	8.89804053089873
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	10.786596001417298
We must go to Athens.	13.466638608155629
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	9.656950216351062
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	10.419783776683108
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	8.145728502681319
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	13.483775714858087
— Yes, my love?	14.406950141345236
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	9.394688792970609
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	12.56048669081281
he said frankly.	18.489850295922587
A ponderous Saxon.	15.549558147456708
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	14.123302125563756
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	8.184793291468726
Because he comes from Oxford.	14.370307159328547
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	12.457909629106636
He can ’ t make you out.	15.967862122477925
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	11.577753114803507
He shaved warily over his chin.	10.829712675280456
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	8.96344483965551
Where is his guncase?	14.022358080992513
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	8.357080815298653
Were you in a funk?	15.425210814316376
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	10.184518466435394
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	9.687583699684014
I ’ m not a hero, however.	10.713002731500831
If he stays on here I am off.	10.923169638069577
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	9.335538590249143
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	7.626361862073838
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	12.447308852381328
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	8.07395134798834
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	9.84518578747592
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	9.032465223224301
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	8.697188568450919
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	11.669309669524806
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	8.036043029779027
— God! he said quietly.	14.795792886161877
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	10.43445982082529
The snotgreen sea.	15.03299954537589
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	14.434194379250288
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	11.694970360318104
You must read them in the original.	14.295847986604276
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	10.329576542948393
Come and look.	19.85126545738413
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	14.102220176241774
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	10.053227937617757
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	8.95580139775228
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	9.993999095794315
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	8.848659691985084
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	10.75244591942403
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	12.160396577066939
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	8.493354063226375
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	10.492639930585781
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	9.66766841851946
And you refused.	15.238273464954855
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	7.978491804145641
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	9.07782105191052
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	9.811593210498266
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	9.538533805489852
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	7.113448416265467
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	11.120770127211053
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	7.439121264623829
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	7.725285549147085
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	8.117402622881038
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	6.312092000096904
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	10.026517889986353
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	12.880823099434926
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	13.136620442952962
How are the secondhand breeks?	11.089671934773685
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	10.539698594540559
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	8.363899083659307
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	13.558082554152149
Secondleg they should be.	16.22579427424285
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	9.734377741769864
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	10.827781483696025
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	8.94612435792054
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	13.762958490298798
— Thanks, Stephen said.	11.555966204707932
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	11.90726633742678
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	11.576006043983938
Etiquette is etiquette.	15.697754718879334
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	11.663825971575461
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	10.265023256168828
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	10.097231092410961
p.	29.6601428913208
i.	51.84919088584364
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	8.427822423965631
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	7.1932552844556055
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	8.214833419484583
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	9.232298272581858
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	9.645443964503217
Hair on end.	17.995891067614927
As he and others see me.	13.81383719803167
Who chose this face for me?	12.974385591482603
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	9.60305537475591
It asks me too.	14.632212687950163
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	8.120963685466545
It does her all right.	13.001477832077692
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	7.523738154989215
Lead him not into temptation.	12.70608242320116
And her name is Ursula.	14.699004750689204
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	13.173605546116706
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	8.585614908509783
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	9.39765993615712
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	10.982635848273622
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	8.547807179360882
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	10.929737273300624
he said kindly.	17.480105745023298
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	11.81567317457087
Parried again.	22.925816972849656
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	9.392216575643518
The cold steel pen.	14.19248306752167
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	7.926254278751327
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	10.230789468307071
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	7.078302140718363
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	11.603944802399756
Hellenise it.	23.83813679680877
Cranly ’ s arm.	15.24694600262903
His arm.	22.053055669008657
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	9.539869779392708
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	11.534894679255464
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	13.245820194163551
What have you up your nose against me?	12.818653952031626
Is it Haines?	18.860920220442942
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	8.448173282359564
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	6.557370873982131
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	8.807627045387951
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	6.59023105287936
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	9.58738643430873
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	7.5345937641979415
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	5.2612286073668475
To ourselves...	15.436378805753224
new paganism...	10.691400407885123
omphalos.	44.80800061837366
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	9.456407423322338
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	10.412061159643848
— Then what is it?	13.544981192624503
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	12.208373604088361
Cough it up.	19.1308012534516
I ’ m quite frank with you.	9.357365559471837
What have you against me now?	14.645257565005243
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	7.9456305652251125
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	13.57694975264732
— Do you wish me to tell you?	12.490255374789204
he asked.	10.114487674314143
— Yes, what is it?	12.471343568829367
I don ’ t remember anything.	11.04619757745221
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	13.96609790195147
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	6.769769425538938
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	11.743262240945993
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	12.230653818620768
Where?	20.27410746882259
I can ’ t remember anything.	13.143396474599772
I remember only ideas and sensations.	10.830546524564715
Why?	18.42545846291693
What happened in the name of God?	15.573085889233163
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	10.161173005371444
She asked you who was in your room.	15.314007409066605
— Yes?	16.576671962240066
Buck Mulligan said.	8.671312652395416
What did I say?	16.99087194904592
I forget.	24.61236129384496
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	8.24598476457211
— Did I say that?	16.521616297908167
he asked.	10.114487674314143
Well?	29.037771862354383
What harm is that?	15.36875285507682
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	9.80221710343398
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	11.551246840976578
You saw only your mother die.	11.864249864488988
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	7.872438564273474
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	10.420459119978728
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	13.520296382899401
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	10.152970895915008
Why?	18.42545846291693
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	12.627847723117753
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	9.925330279374696
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	7.022319896987
Humour her till it ’ s over.	14.435839257729132
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	7.121557802040727
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	14.618891459120842
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	10.035838105373179
He had spoken himself into boldness.	10.009481297798526
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	9.499959762965394
— Of what then?	14.50622407710646
Buck Mulligan asked.	12.632079373690408
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	11.880859721962297
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	11.234171801812327
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	10.153255008020817
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	10.412684348751856
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	9.289792648006282
Sea and headland now grew dim.	10.042328210732151
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	10.29094962968549
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	11.309248273335879
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	9.890768976814314
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	12.852964893904268
What does it care about offences?	10.663749681067559
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	9.151926855951398
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	9.409452837377858
I ’ m inconsequent.	12.667246757887193
Give up the moody brooding.	11.799113335455212
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	6.544934401055082
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	8.214692266939604
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	7.3590592073540115
White breast of the dim sea.	12.02143102748695
The twining stresses, two by two.	10.077575463326175
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	5.972904451509875
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	8.827867569303892
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	7.001783760955848
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	11.31196938172388
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	10.738303206047238
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	11.364112792851294
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	10.880513618605367
She was crying in her wretched bed.	10.739599582498357
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	11.62555131251696
Where now?	25.07224508013934
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	5.115935576839136
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	7.30711176162071
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	9.342396407413633
And no more turn aside and brood.	9.75390903234604
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	12.15078766712849
Memories beset his brooding brain.	8.880618407936703
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	10.02532342014402
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	7.4688553156774695
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	7.474749551116173
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	7.491877587716812
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	9.363975889966195
On me alone.	17.6403726268846
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	9.792644376850152
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	11.80430137601528
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	8.225881162493371
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	13.315952065376676
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	5.9901930017736875
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	9.953595919728798
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	11.345507513665668
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	9.711763046319504
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	14.796541242551108
Breakfast is ready.	16.095325191724008
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	8.232640129546494
It ’ s all right.	9.934396004283242
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	12.001272574193873
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	8.290259139407414
For my sake and for all our sakes.	13.087344100348673
His head disappeared and reappeared.	11.014156043599487
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	9.77265356216093
He says it ’ s very clever.	13.225147989222284
Touch him for a quid, will you?	14.13813454554955
A guinea, I mean.	16.30450667548423
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	10.028372131851603
— The school kip?	13.909639942927456
Buck Mulligan said.	8.671312652395416
How much?	20.096425638232507
Four quid?	25.195653005932634
Lend us one.	19.990165530450685
— If you want it, Stephen said.	11.43430370658671
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	8.920049335305873
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	7.599540211453774
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	12.941568183436292
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	6.89280693390077
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	9.16831859178188
Why should I bring it down?	14.920615051556698
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	12.941430417663124
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	8.830057923815577
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	9.551646299483096
I am another now and yet the same.	11.881676219226982
A server of a servant.	13.58768047188004
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	6.689973175669025
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	6.5617971379723965
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	8.167448677729414
Haines, open that door, will you?	11.113178276274551
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	10.217007200267908
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	9.676069273725167
— Have you the key?	14.024192486464607
a voice asked.	10.347123747336578
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	10.399711450247201
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	7.81429525151665
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	14.583128041708898
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	9.464996722960485
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	9.844390453734727
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	9.440166453235216
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	10.587097068802452
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	8.15629732182937
Haines, come in.	18.07693222643639
The grub is ready.	12.001252488935398
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	13.19003179229686
Where ’ s the sugar?	16.726556146532296
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	13.209782166082368
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	8.225076925030347
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	11.415842893457919
— What sort of a kip is this?	12.083177982309408
I told her to come after eight.	14.020275422503648
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	10.98200434077863
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	11.038323527957488
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	7.722405255082073
I want Sandycove milk.	14.083527739656457
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	13.775084907718378
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	9.74079605464603
Sit down.	21.383858029464246
Pour out the tea there.	16.177879485230825
The sugar is in the bag.	15.369910360456412
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	11.777406732875926
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	6.699404618475502
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	8.546161271642497
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	11.773697009470313
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	8.27822140958013
And when I makes water I makes water.	10.591853692208817
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	10.774850791748769
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	8.245142006158243
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	7.913960019606303
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	11.118027322726205
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	7.186096967364763
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	10.777448348034453
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	7.974848264653138
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	11.924236760533852
— Do you now?	14.255569416554753
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	14.130385442121595
Your reasons, pray?	16.3793203967023
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	10.809079599844218
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	9.299213529660323
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	11.523466290835689
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	8.860667086037038
Do you think she was?	16.34138551129003
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	7.378622439511205
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	8.602908869791404
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	9.427807361443216
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	11.030063274922908
Kinch, get the jug.	18.054046031147998
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	12.901369711324891
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	10.558615272452743
Glory be to God.	16.184264407194366
— To whom?	18.909908906677483
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	16.412524717123233
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	9.499143042464153
— How much, sir?	13.905751219356915
asked the old woman.	20.90722237983369
— A quart, Stephen said.	10.588554713621162
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	7.722630293771961
Old shrunken paps.	14.322450041816252
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	8.831011659476921
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	8.56437562986302
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	9.62771650365887
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	6.428056457125587
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	8.826098286844697
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	9.875275682962073
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	6.262097542849554
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	8.03543970447368
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	8.528229407790725
— Taste it, sir, she said.	11.936255108219465
He drank at her bidding.	13.336331793057873
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	9.641770745796004
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	5.823369962129191
— Are you a medical student, sir?	10.725636727804226
the old woman asked.	12.972628929900107
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	9.0052151834223
— Look at that now, she said.	12.37906181757706
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	11.183281904794677
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	7.927459408057992
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	7.82735932040452
— Do you understand what he says?	13.388591514839684
Stephen asked her.	19.686077385709428
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	10.449442307252086
the old woman said to Haines.	12.58408683473217
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	11.680362173216288
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	10.261927338310917
Is there Gaelic on you?	13.743007723349171
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	13.307382827946839
Are you from the west, sir?	14.299597600959025
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	10.419141422639525
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	10.234996196000829
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	11.41691370796549
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	12.063504827311538
Wonderful entirely.	23.173687711106478
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	11.72662812393913
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	11.903669839898075
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	9.88139567365547
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	15.35421171888201
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	11.691678873977327
Stephen filled again the three cups.	13.503553709181032
— Bill, sir?	14.50363853965323
she said, halting.	13.417289024681228
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	6.917702997627144
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	10.849235548540179
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	7.580719718400698
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	12.288110714317957
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	7.860635617401071
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	10.189278582266914
All I can give you I give.	15.41606870618451
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	10.633609143278413
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	8.942997366737231
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	14.453721716725997
Time enough.	18.704759952470784
Good morning, sir.	12.248346621078936
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	9.641937286311824
I ’ m stony.	13.187200404014058
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	9.688547102391414
Today the bards must drink and junket.	9.29714164804836
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	10.24827884420427
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	10.93740894275231
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	8.764867837827317
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	9.426836347964715
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	9.814335072555004
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	8.466490319715682
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	8.368571229347555
Speaking to me.	17.989278172997505
They wash and tub and scrub.	9.933393658348894
Agenbite of inwit.	12.155087366242142
Conscience.	49.786713264135244
Yet here ’ s a spot.	17.264524923380094
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	7.979551476627911
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	10.244104227400848
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	12.372566759704787
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	11.295496092404978
— Would I make any money by it?	10.292946481047661
Stephen asked.	15.303264734747627
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	10.704262361019422
He strolled out to the doorway.	14.709959696544033
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	9.309956246020773
— Well?	18.4893876841978
Stephen said.	11.94982048593145
The problem is to get money.	14.16898406037325
From whom?	25.350161471901448
From the milkwoman or from him.	10.538142846470691
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	11.758535265210156
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	8.982449599174107
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	12.179287736855327
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	10.307821912652575
— From me, Kinch, he said.	11.89157152975033
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	10.748867765781299
Damn all else they are good for.	13.392132585449676
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	13.921640022774106
To hell with them all.	14.789428480163808
Let us get out of the kip.	13.553636881784549
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	7.661537802614653
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	11.61104568875801
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	9.235565377940258
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	8.811798842938572
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	11.433054477700326
I want puce gloves and green boots.	10.253233005339302
Contradiction.	44.80800061837366
Do I contradict myself?	12.967129124932004
Very well then, I contradict myself.	11.851010190987832
Mercurial Malachi.	26.38344081716137
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	9.636497190218405
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	10.561804437967913
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	17.427561124256847
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	13.039148517854631
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	9.362700107948653
Come out, Kinch.	17.241017029312722
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	11.12581707367936
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	8.309219126970616
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	9.475638055375574
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	10.582163287302937
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	11.211573361745522
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	13.533150775099683
He walked on.	14.206730939498529
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	7.154488676527605
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	10.9586152688544
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	8.795157818297575
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	8.248309036927775
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	7.828572359809513
Martello you call it?	18.768889827054746
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	9.382020096845439
But ours is the _omphalos_.	12.076067489411733
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	11.739333903826894
Haines asked Stephen.	19.47200911652851
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	10.841035478426063
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	7.0441632953243625
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	12.808261659552596
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	8.675699321724048
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	9.335848268982467
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	8.653649539260874
Is it some paradox?	14.678440634816033
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	8.947179960132743
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	9.570426039916036
It ’ s quite simple.	14.005355512480136
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	8.49810043109969
— What?	11.791741423260737
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	13.042042483174292
He himself?	24.45290084575958
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	8.809791143705672
And it is rather long to tell.	12.879585168099382
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	10.680205373295843
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	7.0328332277425964
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	8.438775693044422
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	8.774051240459242
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	9.866734527965992
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	7.4609042784414905
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	9.88187739886215
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	7.414361054780343
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	6.549852810969233
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	9.936472904897016
The Father and the Son idea.	12.719749628949916
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	9.371943857689251
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	8.522181723764092
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	7.813761148355672
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	8.162835315137166
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	14.974552284730166
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	9.777966029379165
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	10.686779280853102
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	7.477387105119451
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	6.825016418579942
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	6.659199904943444
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	10.087596538939785
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	12.234207153847555
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	10.732865097948213
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	8.878790138470638
What did he call it?	14.346758195714692
Joseph the Joiner?	17.15585505289073
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	8.939076139656835
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	14.642383530527756
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	11.456077395882941
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	10.411682028039829
Haines asked.	20.551992642785905
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	9.401317045230208
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	9.225619137522665
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	10.424070961002412
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	8.659854785201674
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	13.265344488331717
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	12.07921525912159
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	7.892082709676595
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	13.081933326586912
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	10.09499159618074
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	10.701702446022443
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	15.40168688280832
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	8.780031335959233
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	10.397219458205724
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	8.6491375034472
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	8.315640679322856
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	11.165887237000653
He wants that key.	13.067664922016183
It is mine.	17.023812525933433
I paid the rent.	14.352827547106376
Now I eat his salt bread.	10.944937255436718
Give him the key too.	15.129055589985185
All.	22.956535929794043
He will ask for it.	13.133478840408502
That was in his eyes.	16.05332049398294
— After all, Haines began...	11.931525441356724
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	10.107529005469575
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	10.800149695138705
You are your own master, it seems to me.	11.49559819709688
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	10.78773780966295
— Italian?	20.702998577891513
Haines said.	16.20501645135494
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	12.03541424483806
Kneel down before me.	14.638716568279483
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	11.1713557094989
— Italian?	20.702998577891513
Haines said again.	19.075391286038723
What do you mean?	15.590965141622258
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	9.023336202542943
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	8.053277932944125
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	12.634451569332498
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	12.621855155611918
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	8.560316746922622
It seems history is to blame.	11.2570247398098
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	5.236652795722926
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	5.957011561717874
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	6.019060953582109
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	9.793681452245456
Idle mockery.	23.02722228403958
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	6.793548084492392
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	8.77360651499396
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	11.097435832085994
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	8.859341347004355
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	10.614250222081704
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	7.633134677633898
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	10.699466699659848
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	9.553461082405917
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	9.258864068672349
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	9.687058425390374
It ’ s nine days today.	11.304595170012202
The man that was drowned.	13.784174242262784
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	7.104088434104147
Here I am.	20.643698872606365
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	11.12304758316936
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	8.026459637501757
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	7.493423903615531
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	12.723234441796532
— Down in Westmeath.	12.875273496538268
With the Bannons.	13.828875557593625
— Still there?	18.90428576548485
I got a card from Bannon.	13.348442892234528
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	11.061618990571642
Photo girl he calls her.	14.747860227523026
— Snapshot, eh?	11.501743606040025
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	9.490868090931382
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	7.81522660361353
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	8.122098155835205
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	12.139189763947751
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	10.307342782085437
— Going over next week to stew.	9.256273886770298
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	10.325702494699387
— Yes.	10.03743100058611
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	11.2780707981397
The father is rotto with money.	10.595976686522064
— Is she up the pole?	11.471247907476208
— Better ask Seymour that.	11.235767337079261
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	7.798312633370286
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	8.627196302516428
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	9.522179377174917
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	10.143618986467985
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	9.227556877274221
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	11.235357462803325
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	11.366504723339544
— Yes.	10.03743100058611
Make room in the bed.	15.06806154734719
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	8.123672780471274
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	15.516116230661023
— Are you not coming in?	12.497231215576617
Buck Mulligan asked.	12.632079373690408
— Later on, Haines said.	11.454350422218436
Not on my breakfast.	16.361354267412604
Stephen turned away.	19.69677682129662
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	9.85857386294031
Stephen handed him the key.	16.47818781865523
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	9.283992485716164
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	14.458923594700428
Throw it there.	19.783414531121814
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	11.382701816268973
Dressing, undressing.	15.510165651970313
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	8.702849068232172
Thus spake Zarathustra.	14.82021821658999
His plump body plunged.	12.85774167084035
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	9.391512308717743
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	10.400872321731132
Half twelve.	23.996237860101832
— Good, Stephen said.	11.063189285188226
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	9.714598588156246
Liliata rutilantium.	21.813369048889317
Turma circumdet.	17.491345280693682
Iubilantium te virginum.	11.328658358168093
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	7.719358337135357
I will not sleep here tonight.	11.212307771088225
Home also I cannot go.	13.09199688813644
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	9.776169071263592
It called again.	16.76802727321107
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	11.612457867422743
Usurper.	44.80800061837366
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	9.288686915866325
— Tarentum, sir.	11.512224896114729
— Very good.	14.533370277952665
Well?	29.037771862354383
— There was a battle, sir.	10.815997364206645
— Very good.	14.533370277952665
Where?	20.27410746882259
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	10.017819542557834
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	12.287944687222325
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	10.771964415193937
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	7.844261529350283
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	6.561369398507466
What ’ s left us then?	14.359506765303147
— I forget the place, sir.	12.529263993420432
<NUM> B.	21.046110447483155
C.	14.422967377726438
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	9.286089317565901
— Yes, sir.	7.6724029537384775
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	8.467546742263064
A dull ease of the mind.	11.202367381853328
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	7.07837693231511
Any general to any officers.	13.549840311953542
They lend ear.	16.232508236490933
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	8.519160602635523
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	15.205744301563838
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	11.34008688694875
— I know, sir.	12.242560085914048
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	13.938818010208664
— Wait.	17.12105415355493
You, Armstrong.	14.094411518388409
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	12.225340619340843
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	6.645227262334501
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	7.831517450174526
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	10.383833409791306
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	12.617786117259552
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	10.236998514095895
Vico Road, Dalkey.	12.398184976884442
— Pyrrhus, sir?	15.211515357075482
Pyrrhus, a pier.	17.825127907787635
All laughed.	23.497190568980706
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	11.30377178001149
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	8.267232461099317
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	7.6105682944207365
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	12.140046439897324
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	11.42163283218295
A thing out in the water.	16.567423707811297
A kind of a bridge.	16.63024228461322
Kingstown pier, sir.	14.41424759815671
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	10.30845948467346
Two in the back bench whispered.	13.981720231327946
Yes.	14.818606210850463
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	9.608413812943102
All.	22.956535929794043
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	7.435105750633731
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	6.727905855475661
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	10.473363253994044
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	10.964452223697906
The words troubled their gaze.	11.451212257633541
— How, sir?	12.880651642236453
Comyn asked.	24.668096612640344
A bridge is across a river.	11.414020611351363
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	13.257954685514294
No - one here to hear.	13.236034725597683
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	8.380792173393814
What then?	24.269141688273027
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	7.251772499128291
Why had they chosen all that part?	11.419853181884335
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	11.52276633221471
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	8.233962122331201
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	6.751592362450329
They are not to be thought away.	13.756511060268059
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	8.364044888729495
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	9.963196547331822
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	12.975120633959193
Weave, weaver of the wind.	10.877181401801943
— Tell us a story, sir.	11.145765994598205
— O, do, sir.	13.26159643530553
A ghoststory.	23.19405632889339
— Where do you begin in this?	12.10339393257699
Stephen asked, opening another book.	12.442323618533319
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	10.444900266599433
— And the story, sir?	12.461383648285368
— After, Stephen said.	10.760672192247307
Go on, Talbot.	16.75433365964282
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	6.91300759544615
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	7.434684076970598
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	6.894708608910154
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	6.348537217951223
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	5.756774367151431
Thought is the thought of thought.	15.142828567730751
Tranquil brightness.	23.173994542397814
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	12.599636994976171
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	8.025204189619744
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	9.54707902793489
I don ’ t see anything.	12.48106808546933
— What, sir?	12.207141979607623
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	11.75597316108503
His hand turned the page over.	13.297830410623806
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	12.567589638666886
Of him that walked the waves.	12.321289310066053
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	7.751291054333118
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	8.678363835190034
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	11.08214220486077
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	7.239629523871316
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	8.283562527860171
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	9.935007832398405
— Have I heard all?	13.72513618546496
Stephen asked.	15.303264734747627
— Yes, sir.	7.6724029537384775
Hockey at ten, sir.	12.456710852455128
— Half day, sir.	12.28114320017582
Thursday.	38.58735493210183
— Who can answer a riddle?	10.258640779067546
Stephen asked.	15.303264734747627
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	6.726774470334529
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	7.221846560326123
— O, ask me, sir.	11.282495031236559
— A hard one, sir.	11.60370160913033
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	8.413706603088494
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	8.507544478686654
What is that?	14.786543369025836
— What, sir?	12.207141979607623
We didn ’ t hear.	15.3158871581131
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	10.007091452821985
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	12.700521089794305
We give it up.	17.336985987995803
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	9.315169365254464
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	8.248909920543046
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	8.197358495410406
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	8.424523828913054
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	8.813320016244525
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	6.620928243288753
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	6.373543361470102
He held out his copybook.	13.79383697853175
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	8.492318978001629
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	7.597460155157622
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	13.655413642043932
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	12.34560326328394
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	12.325816313204975
Futility.	44.80800061837366
— Do you understand how to do them now?	11.708394998709025
he asked.	10.114487674314143
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	8.041740430827453
— Can you do them yourself?	13.402868067973248
Stephen asked.	15.303264734747627
— No, sir.	11.290938241433519
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	7.230409140155799
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	12.60238269780837
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	8.325225473037444
Was that then real?	16.645991485731553
The only true thing in life?	14.317309021020494
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	6.591761739043882
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	7.9152577815027945
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	8.521558782771853
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	6.754788716943641
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	11.448044587616035
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	8.64539449757929
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	10.12687241349093
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	8.88081597269111
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	6.789716129542172
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	7.004307556658619
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	7.087048285812818
— Do you understand now?	12.325840024871047
Can you work the second for yourself?	13.469182744705682
— Yes, sir.	7.6724029537384775
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	7.418052289823918
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	7.8043632347621195
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	7.123113028438743
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	6.827129833811484
My childhood bends beside me.	11.724216114700203
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	12.07136988686034
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	10.851745065512679
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	6.660753804687759
The sum was done.	14.455660201621141
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	12.356405320132078
— Yes, sir.	7.6724029537384775
Thanks, Sargent answered.	12.690128632852193
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	8.458852586278852
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	10.634737903896726
— Yes, sir.	7.6724029537384775
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	10.653348721578954
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	9.923007322281753
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	6.79715021188608
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	6.429822468057871
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	8.25534161504426
He turned his angry white moustache.	10.385789985558395
he cried continually without listening.	11.042096539174752
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	9.906125476732942
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	10.06370712160436
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	10.371780656557155
What is it now?	18.368735643195418
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	7.407173060693887
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	7.710384951467252
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	11.630082918689592
As it was in the beginning, is now.	15.243282277656336
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	7.29177881055029
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	6.613486403856623
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	11.066180940885584
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	9.953470142235672
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	8.100341703751669
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	9.87106424843956
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	9.689779412846756
And now his strongroom for the gold.	10.801210821958525
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	5.802871277653236
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	7.132468450471925
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	9.51856390314071
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	10.790109441644873
These are handy things to have.	12.02694246676501
See.	24.86498069429457
This is for sovereigns.	13.641363448893674
This is for shillings.	14.668622533004479
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	15.608214787160694
And here crowns.	16.454802469293902
See.	24.86498069429457
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	10.18351840208103
— Three twelve, he said.	10.4804623438208
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	13.73264882387576
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	9.813926366546044
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	10.628702200643396
You have earned it.	12.780474568243799
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	11.767451131755127
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	14.896734079696207
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	8.12056780397321
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	10.614506235307521
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	10.54487717090281
You just buy one of these machines.	13.240149399399147
You ’ ll find them very handy.	11.380339512867332
Answer something.	25.30760864122844
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	8.800431034733412
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	11.467642003590322
Three times now.	17.236259140271994
Three nooses round me here.	11.249631324827005
Well?	29.037771862354383
I can break them in this instant if I will.	12.056525768528234
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	11.579486006053925
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	10.526781385804577
When you have lived as long as I have.	13.872479721135557
I know, I know.	15.888462095610437
If youth but knew.	14.764870298656886
But what does Shakespeare say?	13.062923150341199
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	9.254784814989256
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	10.297163225077252
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	10.307109795035108
He made money.	16.760145992174987
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	13.477976052645865
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	11.890332866295898
The seas ’ ruler.	12.025628955461096
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	9.385431560567227
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	11.238569911850343
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	13.307112734476785
That ’ s not English.	13.879330399528147
A French Celt said that.	11.332483256495204
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	10.076617220244987
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	11.572158236837282
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	12.686245241301702
_ — I paid my way.	11.960072625544944
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	11.289564321147648
_I owe <URL> Can you?	13.8654125012892
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	8.94582123774155
Curran, ten guineas.	16.120999905297396
McCann, one guinea.	18.63534842266538
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	12.29830135425415
Temple, two lunches.	16.724268918775856
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	7.150721739646804
The lump I have is useless.	10.966937366640652
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	14.577727255801678
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	9.574226881936282
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	11.326562981744917
But one day you must feel it.	12.691816507266978
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	9.101058683132637
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	7.181061967056354
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	8.449829971219943
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	9.705927259967345
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	10.431477942922772
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	6.873665188812968
You fenians forget some things.	10.427351692460311
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	10.215058914817753
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	5.549351075252218
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	7.335028704799693
The black north and true blue bible.	10.337210296901368
Croppies lie down.	17.383955586153274
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	12.24432334083843
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	9.787350049378789
On the spindle side.	12.412420732642792
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	8.206830637348746
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	10.153402625712744
— Alas, Stephen said.	11.009537352566177
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	8.67160913256603
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	9.425727354541621
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	7.504382292740936
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	6.59906288812956
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	9.586797325159777
Day!...	13.224536322810222
Day!...	13.224536322810222
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	9.607981966426376
Lal the ral the ra.	9.644604001472649
Lal the ral the raddy.	8.981416823211006
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	9.809599924332145
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	11.679244136413336
I have a letter here for the press.	12.322597939596806
Sit down a moment.	16.778682040148556
I have just to copy the end.	11.606048385577354
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	8.691248465461431
— Sit down.	14.980285845507815
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	9.715881054054229
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	6.576725293255678
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	8.910200759229513
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	5.696274035444258
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	9.887529453217567
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	11.21257392729599
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	6.432061838718555
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	9.16402084366287
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	5.8479942598158585
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	8.73748959981897
Again: a goal.	15.839828014299743
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	8.005901615010023
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	7.806448232596478
Jousts.	44.19093781523242
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	7.595710920371231
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	6.0454969689740565
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	14.237318161799019
Stephen stood up.	17.47978277648055
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	8.917057144914276
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	10.220948125094985
Just look through it.	15.193916917754475
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	11.428287324257795
May I trespass on your valuable space.	10.70961844405648

— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	11.234494109856122
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	11.180835474224232
Foot and mouth disease.	13.320677490151398

Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	12.301479856329877
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	10.580657825214304
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	8.110546098744239
And it can be cured.	13.778873890568354
It is cured.	16.711176520294238
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	6.1073890463231155
They offer to come over here.	12.126431918267652

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	8.899019319976377
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	11.46520116942617
England is in the hands of the jews.	16.081230445473118
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	9.750242709102132
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	10.867816891662642
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	8.549300735986215
I have seen it coming these years.	10.481464572796305
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	8.765168255568382
Old England is dying.	14.7710853638188
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	9.812635871332496
He faced about and back again.	11.268089609793563
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	12.927456301012008
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	6.891957825425225
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	8.428936560869207
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	9.605016459582918
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	11.857216069023348
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	13.444287635246866
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	11.01383360019148
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	5.9833226956836585
Gabble of geese.	15.060782865608829
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	6.5467578622685965
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	8.98961260479901
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	6.420669829977755
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	9.199478727304944
Time surely would scatter all.	10.563246968589342
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	7.429880532700875
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	7.9368093475826225
— Who has not?	16.106124200848296
Stephen said.	11.94982048593145
— What do you mean?	13.940384159804962
Mr Deasy asked.	13.308253323518077
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	11.937956969912706
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	9.622662736646271
Is this old wisdom?	15.43623832490307
He waits to hear from me.	12.65041147676246
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	11.59079538880804
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	10.607387857391279
A whirring whistle: goal.	9.847911617924076
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	11.128618276752105
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	8.621227891444398
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	7.60702912607479
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	12.848084142089643
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	10.373328513527383
Mr Deasy asked.	13.308253323518077
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	10.085445039830025
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	8.81036064292455
Looking up again he set them free.	11.844942823336817
— I am happier than you are, he said.	9.918593178685727
We have committed many errors and many sins.	8.561772199453538
A woman brought sin into the world.	9.783235799235932
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	7.598348813915642
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	7.327504020270855
A woman too brought Parnell low.	10.877253090068926
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	10.035805996864298
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	10.91126211918137
But I will fight for the right till the end.	12.967435226311622
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	9.446968336659884
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	13.642352326959715
— Well, sir, he began.	13.774292777961383
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	9.900843685330631
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	11.738912988472874
Perhaps I am wrong.	16.784663043244503
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	8.912734636030677
And here what will you learn more?	11.659273154514363
Mr Deasy shook his head.	12.31982474803659
— Who knows?	15.601198514752268
he said.	10.24588778153892
To learn one must be humble.	11.873750045133548
But life is the great teacher.	15.187142924931566
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	12.87937529170143
— As regards these, he began.	12.791503899380706
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	8.599175855587738
You have two copies there.	10.903917364489933
If you can have them published at once.	10.649421343482022
_ Telegraph.	24.765017429955897
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	14.560687021467281
I know two editors slightly.	10.60118804408106
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	11.632837159027662
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	8.290488568074139
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	10.976357176112636
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	13.125235902534401
What are they?	19.259209492459853
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	10.784462566470356
There is no time to lose.	14.926237833675351
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	12.87763807338668
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	10.976601519589037
Thank you.	18.10652994144807
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	10.852509578992153
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	11.61490061387003
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	10.933647640649236
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	8.652176569396778
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	8.629486577953589
Still I will help him in his fight.	13.806200124951362
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	9.348373680880684
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	10.021251120563601
No more letters, I hope.	14.845923119959053
— Just one moment.	14.0565735853635
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	10.14125020891034
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	8.666541051097738
— I just wanted to say, he said.	11.910459736982826
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	10.598493589248818
Do you know that?	14.455981216350443
No. And do you know why?	13.79081008417518
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	11.77264417269205
— Why, sir?	15.467723133117632
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	13.5495637515388
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	13.139642526924934
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	8.944552334157
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	8.452606930722451
That ’ s why.	12.746546940327143
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	6.854144543740912
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	10.09624740451967
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	8.408530171429183
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	7.0171640790848295
Limits of the diaphane.	15.896197817086582
But he adds: in bodies.	11.057058174279602
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	9.11896974178709
How?	26.762088021875993
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	9.347223278413919
Go easy.	25.51795386992098
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	7.269486423490528
Limit of the diaphane in.	13.151013957606182
Why in?	21.7690682738659
Diaphane, adiaphane.	15.195762568278662
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	11.136916919903307
Shut your eyes and see.	15.538312219058025
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	9.346186249608303
You are walking through it howsomever.	10.61259546067598
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	9.724507482749592
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	12.120265926704707
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	11.857982513206416
Open your eyes.	17.44094462521981
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	7.317109777121427
My ash sword hangs at my side.	10.196627295945731
Tap with it: they do.	16.991377443731924
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	10.440099308471686
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	7.238575078001133
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	9.870818051208085
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	9.125387232250922
Wild sea money.	16.374313281885644
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	11.109801176240753
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	10.162147760676461
Rhythm begins, you see.	13.890200784832402
I hear.	19.15576177154669
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	7.260893988153534
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	6.991919738459861
Open your eyes now.	15.146809873541429
I will.	18.45052472787935
One moment.	18.78249917651693
Has all vanished since?	13.625881773904881
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	11.314183912538793
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	16.168068036216727
See now.	21.722762843928155
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	10.872656905343776
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	6.529110309914783
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	10.894027433064021
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	8.084116584188436
From the liberties, out for the day.	12.309136091295013
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	6.927127375295263
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	7.6887351622156395
Creation from nothing.	15.62156563144294
What has she in the bag?	15.590739078895089
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	6.356360267468016
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	7.615312242321869
That is why mystic monks.	11.22922437418301
Will you be as gods?	16.470371865891547
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	14.842518576181156
Hello.	26.156206652584363
Kinch here.	25.672104279776782
Put me on to Edenville.	16.723955294619902
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	9.833668660972611
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	6.273549007303377
She had no navel.	14.255390929331941
Gaze.	35.31585665834903
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	5.909872244226524
Womb of sin.	16.935349884591165
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	9.808088864741515
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	11.9210641436268
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	8.655644252837254
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	8.414970637469025
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	8.715426506499133
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	9.466026040998486
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	11.727159728980505
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	7.685705252160189
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	5.845434578308647
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	8.57366994829042

Beauty is not there.	17.76959112985121

For whom?	25.364775113187644
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	8.274888823959591

Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	5.417649119367959
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	10.03042008926239
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	8.735251585857078

More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women! _ What about that, eh?	8.286639433578161
What about what?	18.003624836894687
What else were they invented for?	13.039591352911698

Remembering thee, O Sion.	13.631440782757712
He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	9.349437549418354
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of brightness.	7.258659015377537
Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?	11.488054630664609
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	8.897953083593224
Turn back.	24.61940812040824
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	8.775534934255834
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	10.727794686158235
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	6.235459892186118
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	8.159669082358882
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	6.513412415884506
Who to clear it?	14.994111958497314
He has the key.	14.865188337170565
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	10.041792499964052
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	7.719559762774888
Call: no answer.	15.927817118595144
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	9.299855131399255
Take all, keep all.	15.921667906304943
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	11.12892915233916
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	7.178094465886316
The flood is following me.	11.85017543130444
I can watch it flow past from here.	10.066491072216104
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	9.953514282228827
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	6.767841845279912
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	8.012032175487468
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	5.642858767705513
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	6.694929749453956
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	6.423478813225093
Hide gold there.	17.620610015133135
Try it.	19.373492360942922
You have some.	20.47377745083434
Sands and stones.	16.759242001339032
Heavy of the past.	18.797395041539424
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	10.542221765399743
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	11.439492519577941
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	6.892370588190036
Feefawfum.	44.80800061837366
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	6.56183501319233
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	7.434892156695421
Lord, is he going to attack me?	14.858280066033187
Respect his liberty.	17.15425642117075
You will not be master of others or their slave.	11.033913926273017
I have my stick.	14.22345038680872
Sit tight.	23.845518762315244
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	8.207739925222263
The two maries.	14.429599799188072
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	7.938706206979911
Peekaboo.	44.80800061837366
I see you.	17.45577144089906
No, the dog.	13.685570663260904
He is running back to them.	13.076498606410334
Who?	24.00141934869033
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	6.142113805253582
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	6.028313308702893
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	5.207642205099019
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	5.2577249540569015
Famine, plague and slaughters.	9.916338150850374
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	11.567952088690056
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	8.815460335987419
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	12.447586649730408
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	9.422324332733151
Dog of my enemy.	17.42300496535875
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	9.151952921082753
_Terribilia meditans_.	19.669709954004386
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	7.833478036390395
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	10.036533865438836
Pretenders: live their lives.	11.037610084661749
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	5.895610753047518
All kings ’ sons.	12.595097614599407
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	10.880105343271763
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	7.825869794983716
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	6.679566399368709
House of...	16.34688576132568
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	10.687565552541672
Would you do what he did?	18.47779106988204
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	11.38231166286158
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	14.874945348557963
Would you or would you not?	13.546373033959723
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	8.569097828859233
They are waiting for him now.	14.104665697157959
The truth, spit it out.	11.672044424463161
I would want to.	17.12196315474228
I would try.	21.11879780490028
I am not a strong swimmer.	11.866351009973444
Water cold soft.	17.361070404542154
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	12.214846075339954
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	13.666525874277676
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	7.643721302002508
If I had land under my feet.	12.169368939335772
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	11.289919725956958
A drowning man.	16.772819937255797
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	9.895406533119909
I...	10.969909899799664
With him together down...	12.165950690080214
I could not save her.	14.33133097508933
Waters: bitter death: lost.	10.68641964885299
A woman and a man.	17.33975422325953
I see her skirties.	14.647034810509385
Pinned up, I bet.	18.96767587033056
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	7.808275364911066
Looking for something lost in a past life.	12.553314933477099
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	7.243649975283445
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	7.671209121338432
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	7.329644199488592
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	6.514559914787099
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	6.551238432771175
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	6.208610784813351
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	6.735437032666129
Cocklepickers.	44.80800061837366
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	8.185526324561494
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	7.149341206862642
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	7.93116717191075
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	8.293837148841993
The carcass lay on his path.	12.727446277926582
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	7.70180884413421
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	8.748288520975184
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	8.441619688871587
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	7.261464689144949
He slunk back in a curve.	13.167460152736954
Doesn ’ t see me.	15.69390751500926
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	6.888080964534133
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	7.381782579886273
The simple pleasures of the poor.	13.813052760408292
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	6.2778880995028254
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	6.725844504270774
Wait.	16.117996620458218
Street of harlots.	13.888308221469906
Remember.	32.432162396480486
Haroun al Raschid.	12.625503887460878
I am almosting it.	11.791366682127961
That man led me, spoke.	13.07741623983771
I was not afraid.	16.200950907619237
The melon he had he held against my face.	11.680696658608488
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	12.344445832283643
That was the rule, said.	12.009846615899695
Red carpet spread.	18.805800995191145
You will see who.	15.987653207196832
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	9.091046490933786
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	6.303183168926779
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	7.771040234171462
Spoils slung at her back.	14.054938990279933
About her windraw face hair trailed.	8.282407290323674
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	7.5506603523785385
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	6.390319474972209
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	6.803179126939173
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	6.116481534734147
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	9.85195877608798
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	6.060701301932241
Couch a hogshead with me then.	11.097986687427289
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	9.568225430275788
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	6.172903553875267
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	10.464051745855837
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	8.16164124193614
Language no whit worse than his.	11.215464760126478
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	5.396850732540331
Passing now.	22.751245366193004
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	11.900929206193751
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	10.769954533784748
I am not.	16.398530139648187
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	5.4574697958805345
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	9.20500488699099
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	7.0078410639670174
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	10.949349424060646
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	8.841873655472796
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	9.301014420963991
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	7.715570686981968
Here.	19.774642670857872
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	11.384109420426112
My tablets.	20.86946871794045
Mouth to her kiss.	18.647029519262663
No. Must be two of em.	11.877844729665009
Glue em well.	16.48687600275737
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	13.977255535611253
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	7.418790892811633
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	10.747690885273476
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	4.652425327005407
Paper.	44.80800061837366
The banknotes, blast them.	11.17873688328683
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	15.035520151409422
Here.	19.774642670857872
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	9.98393650071989
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	9.826407131046498
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	10.741334662358101
Why not endless till the farthest star?	8.605001008934263
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	7.983561443351582
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	6.332075054255555
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	8.262968043298144
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	12.63388063451554
Who watches me here?	16.93076515286689
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	9.611375615597192
Signs on a white field.	17.262350322161982
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	11.051814203114995
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	6.590104974382574
Hold hard.	22.078542423565782
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	12.567827304942076
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	9.650324294349815
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	8.202910711701685
Click does the trick.	13.881673927963291
You find my words dark.	13.3958741947323
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	14.486378247661
Flutier.	44.80800061837366
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	8.512373292794692
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	9.8932030337003
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	10.176725389393152
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	8.9653968895284
She, she, she.	13.46248275070676
What she?	23.251607837744288
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	7.693889597515465
Keen glance you gave her.	13.572584579632395
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	9.25693840871801
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	8.522682226755299
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	9.442280456823658
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	6.656435564471347
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	8.189659258307861
Where are your wits?	14.905089100970402
Touch me.	22.038402796567425
Soft eyes.	24.82897974386157
Soft soft soft hand.	14.465092911375622
I am lonely here.	13.12993505282493
O, touch me soon, now.	11.715469253978394
What is that word known to all men?	14.309686731125145
I am quiet here alone.	11.389334511353383
Sad too.	23.633306466761155
Touch, touch me.	13.92185653653278
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	8.278951290330001
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	7.662459523998265
_Et vidit Deus.	14.137236552749153
Et erant valde bona_.	9.691546148274629
Alo! _Bonjour_.	14.613608709239099
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	6.282919852913067
I am caught in this burning scene.	11.359106320081192
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	11.150450331728804
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	6.239982364866659
Pain is far.	19.79498957432096
And no more turn aside and brood.	9.75390903234604
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	7.389206262024107
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	6.309188035486829
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	7.472444421597437
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	7.553441951633084
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	6.395020011233108
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	10.02213493068514
He now will leave me.	11.24161621820419
And the blame?	17.024169917261357
As I am.	17.42760895113624
As I am.	17.42760895113624
All or not at all.	15.69579856570598
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	6.71871518411743
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	9.022651379425648
Better get this job over quick.	10.1813718727567
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	5.189523073099186
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	7.832355843251627
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	5.536690634752749
And, spent, its speech ceases.	8.778268109217484
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	5.814002509659339
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	5.369804802301105
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	9.135037122090365
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	5.699416741164244
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	5.715331746303916
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	7.463553955615204
Five fathoms out there.	14.294048784216606
Full fathom five thy father lies.	10.831519638759096
At one, he said.	14.152007103361607
Found drowned.	21.997533402242055
High water at Dublin bar.	13.995849156420556
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	7.10087261346407
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	6.102373917096132
There he is.	13.819843310678333
Hook it quick.	16.741124411368617
Pull.	43.051840588071244
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	9.607182813245183
We have him.	19.141138019831377
Easy now.	24.752814399892696
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	7.336066415816968
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	6.052412266847849
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	6.624160364530569
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	5.738427884353512
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	6.465711553220742
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	9.644326625060968
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	9.059616094067307
Old Father Ocean.	16.109162744533663
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	8.033096225450745
Just you give it a fair trial.	13.618640613828415
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	12.664903594842768
Come.	22.108245157254114
I thirst.	24.808596975340002
Clouding over.	24.1294220524533
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	11.180420236601893
Thunderstorm.	44.80800061837366
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	5.629184189903258
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	5.91830391528594
Where?	20.27410746882259
To evening lands.	17.44830188493358
Evening will find itself.	15.899927492800458
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	8.055367221961395
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	11.853160294204901
All days make their end.	11.530716707536161
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	8.965688445325098
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	8.20968639783304
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	11.594682614329182
_Già_.	35.564133659099035
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	10.542920675798705
_Già_.	35.564133659099035
My teeth are very bad.	12.765240299599638
Why, I wonder.	18.251514205407553
Feel.	34.378071440350396
That one is going too.	16.07447088898562
Shells.	44.80800061837366
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	12.960292879048332
That one.	22.059300709990104
This.	28.773406683791585
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	14.635303788873545
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	12.450646561728883
My handkerchief.	24.750421050746766
He threw it.	16.266429278514845
I remember.	17.80828034069685
Did I not take it up?	15.435360503395085
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	9.707988126992863
No, I didn ’ t.	12.460436492746041
Better buy one.	18.05168366097641
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	7.719540130556426
For the rest let look who will.	11.679356725494664
Behind.	43.689762616181284
Perhaps there is someone.	16.62872041257356
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	9.491989006521422
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	6.5382240287796405
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	8.14923848975515
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	5.169285638223752
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	6.740402871141745
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	8.575248753335535
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	8.785468195370152
Made him feel a bit peckish.	12.847600776855547
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	9.74949083061472
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	11.730424135105126
Right.	26.286511886983153
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	8.992940758500993
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	8.606925647382516
Cup of tea soon.	17.089861538508245
Good.	25.732617673280004
Mouth dry.	24.36181133547956
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	9.048183550328783
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	7.866941963546828
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	9.197926367338388
Prr.	35.564133659099035
Scratch my head.	19.188951764169015
Prr.	35.564133659099035
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	7.193640961216301
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	8.886276867724243
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	15.46470187338898
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	9.018519201888465
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	11.779397285409406
They call them stupid.	15.938429054288507
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	9.863162209463766
She understands all she wants to.	11.22187846260535
Vindictive too.	22.771176164339398
Cruel.	37.06710308108618
Her nature.	24.30650101566666
Curious mice never squeal.	12.150216371501582
Seem to like it.	16.36301824103604
Wonder what I look like to her.	14.500740496276162
Height of a tower?	18.643812955303723
No, she can jump me.	12.519483261816458
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	12.063291837318998
Afraid of the chookchooks.	15.194270188761067
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	9.969403703428242
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	7.713357264715727
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	7.431578125898635
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	7.829889927749438
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	10.542921740343242
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	6.6664735972775695
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	10.406081509162817
Why?	18.42545846291693
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	12.267409435197832
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	11.20214609706302
He listened to her licking lap.	12.033997958556743
Ham and eggs, no.	15.41937100277537
No good eggs with this drouth.	11.005216372870482
Want pure fresh water.	14.036741912034621
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	8.793294935794547
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	10.999932117003185
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	9.037011846583473
While the kettle is boiling.	12.95857726789288
Why are their tongues so rough?	11.133628132718732
To lap better, all porous holes.	10.702729197291296
Nothing she can eat?	17.040213512863883
He glanced round him.	14.386931809950829
She might like something tasty.	12.837573880193151
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	10.679558774223471
Still perhaps: once in a way.	14.126188577627875
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	11.107191333635525
Be back in a minute.	17.04208198324044
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	11.683030435704426
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	8.720246380280114
Must get those settled really.	11.782496634165236
Pity.	30.766957684662835
All the way from Gibraltar.	13.540022026366591
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	11.192738785479772
Wonder what her father gave for it.	11.694264320822716
Old style.	23.322790375002967
Ah yes! of course.	14.836625067746448
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	11.353339495702924
Got a short knock.	15.176831227756097
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	11.298765311913446
Yes, sir.	9.980117867118919
At Plevna that was.	15.426940563309529
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	12.203403564155437
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	10.886561379076882
Now that was farseeing.	14.39186483559872
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	7.8121498049461255
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	11.19402135763132
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	8.982477500994529
Course they do.	19.09923553840608
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	8.18881589817113
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	8.931569833784833
White slip of paper.	14.341087289785264
Quite safe.	23.940415869854547
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	9.46899896906502
In the trousers I left off.	14.319857305503607
Must get it.	17.402038923323868
Potato I have.	21.572055157799685
Creaky wardrobe.	21.50892676324382
No use disturbing her.	11.70810552767619
She turned over sleepily that time.	11.37696299751313
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	7.90071410924602
Looked shut.	24.227839342176605
All right till I come back anyhow.	12.702902305362267
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	7.886368964498976
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	8.52041643250179
Be a warm day I fancy.	13.604853684556252
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	10.375626229062501
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	10.16280583160856
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	12.425152972887645
Make a picnic of it.	13.222553704871537
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	9.371546137288135
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	5.67521680177712
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	9.003817847673217
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	11.208709332680796
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	10.785414827621215
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	8.71642671124351
Wander through awned streets.	11.121718788419157
Turbaned faces going by.	15.276807051768111
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	6.394516563889659
Cries of sellers in the streets.	10.292718138864908
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	7.816370761386509
Dander along all day.	14.521007999332745
Might meet a robber or two.	12.11382914207284
Well, meet him.	14.611510387397955
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	7.532934011258578
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	10.38599522784497
I pass on.	20.503393083086294
Fading gold sky.	16.224979171712715
A mother watches me from her doorway.	12.359154175894028
She calls her children home in their dark language.	10.794902492661532
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	9.703031195246716
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	9.120358795731446
Strings.	44.80800061837366
Listen.	27.95183508049224
I pass.	24.96956698183191
Probably not a bit like it really.	15.877796147600135
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	10.801456750006182
Sunburst on the titlepage.	14.862698380627853
He smiled, pleasing himself.	10.889757152979357
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	6.774886921359829
He prolonged his pleased smile.	11.15403538228247
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	8.682670236436893
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	9.741897581869903
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	6.905534147294086
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	6.370026850017932
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	13.26439509689615
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	9.396493404454992
g.	37.032943096766246
as position.	13.624406836286116
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	8.51757717985504
Baldhead over the blind.	17.837977219334014
Cute old codger.	14.609205488073556
No use canvassing him for an ad.	12.625763956879894
Still he knows his own business best.	13.902703634876735
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	7.013763851750644
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	11.466631680169401
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	12.418674672984944
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	14.900296715813013
Do you know what?	14.44141851653466
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	9.338748224417115
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	12.852359896436813
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	12.524485914918625
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	9.404087106173918
— Good day to you.	13.66842334949252
— Lovely weather, sir.	11.21731655421455
— ’ Tis all that.	10.34700332635664
Where do they get the money?	16.539826732701187
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	7.237548516864049
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	6.347877791899208
Then think of the competition.	16.39408371881882
General thirst.	23.052069026499105
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	8.331976323499296
Save it they can ’ t.	13.783920418946794
Off the drunks perhaps.	12.686235684927013
Put down three and carry five.	12.184052132785405
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	9.853288343135418
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	9.459922862939306
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	11.475959228294721
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	9.72035380743572
Say ten barrels of stuff.	12.883502888166076
Say he got ten per cent off.	11.152165642255227
O more.	25.806517918166715
Fifteen.	34.61051803906296
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	9.756846609738638
Brats ’ clamour.	16.173492061474402

Slieve Bloom.	25.770093121553547
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	7.931143280307535
Fifteen multiplied by.	16.87377682085063
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	8.535970776986728
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	5.5051632319636195
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	7.464550501250255
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	10.168186874771818
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	10.66007798255264
Chapped: washingsoda.	14.609046625888158
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	9.678130353264491
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	10.25947991709657

Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	10.280573498446145
She does whack it, by George.	12.925187828332954
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	8.436755925526692
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	9.45541100205124
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	6.687786550574044
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	9.838196770031692
Moses Montefiore.	23.810006160559983
I thought he was.	16.43022838074539
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	9.73591385970861
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	8.00752442352408
A young white heifer.	12.548074077846353
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	5.8135475915380574
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	7.95370524249074
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	7.503821288051778
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	7.460621111235585
— Now, my miss, he said.	11.547552221485613
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	8.431764132683323
— Thank you, my miss.	13.843788058204902
And one shilling threepence change.	10.989210282954282
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	14.15554667453329
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	9.587409128610739
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	12.475995810781834
Hurry up, damn it.	15.42260319607252
Make hay while the sun shines.	13.337433545235255
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	12.336611640828368
Sodachapped hands.	23.346225103634502
Crusted toenails too.	15.037852913446404
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	6.486013551026868
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	6.8139938703316805
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	8.157445925318502
They like them sizeable.	12.970077368592023
Prime sausage.	22.356731648350408
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	12.464130525938748
— Threepence, please.	11.454083268749573
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	7.306739802039512
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	7.9454362801694325
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	8.083333283306557
— Thank you, sir.	9.80236628462637
Another time.	23.624634025461805
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	7.224960432515464
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	11.018418638878378
No: better not: another time.	11.007372484973603
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	13.77767082443446
— Good morning, sir.	9.786306297838456
No sign.	24.34597541807848
Gone.	25.531946322204362
What matter?	25.502729972839113
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	9.475165038864475
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	9.675405924211033

You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	6.09911495120476
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	7.626708321913783

Nothing doing.	24.40131447292456
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	9.092575714700818
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	19.669709954004386
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	8.703700033341649
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	8.228305054567159
I have a few left from Andrews.	11.799036064748606
Molly spitting them out.	15.72421603641105
Knows the taste of them now.	12.473158061613713
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	9.002612811562113
Citrons too.	24.760103480361256
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	8.355075522179837
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	14.748822701080677
Pleasant evenings we had then.	14.549604226625451
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	11.430517588779644
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	7.923107537760144
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	10.830845559542446
Always the same, year after year.	12.412110532045366
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	8.248580829267588
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	8.933963729365342
Must be without a flaw, he said.	9.944905048274068
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	9.129206106212578
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	6.632914122339296
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	11.7169473328634
How do you?	16.126461165006667
Doesn ’ t see.	15.647377731605733
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	12.43236590251459
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	9.39520712643842
Watering cart.	20.487121261034
To provoke the rain.	12.960104819160229
On earth as it is in heaven.	15.147207953911217
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	9.398229368398377
Grey.	45.61529184064059
Far.	26.16274418722864
No, not like that.	15.955398279606294
A barren land, bare waste.	11.341771015065255
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	8.420217115974653
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	7.151995630821471
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	6.968886098591396
All dead names.	16.760937666188823
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	12.05615619413747
Old now.	23.453031529723525
It bore the oldest, the first race.	12.613768286484042
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	8.040191824724733
The oldest people.	15.818757702610489
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	8.08852320336438
It lay there now.	14.620584537395057
Now it could bear no more.	11.574627094092921
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	10.310109410783591
Desolation.	44.80800061837366
Grey horror seared his flesh.	10.107983612955412
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	10.258612370178298
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	6.637384092020057
Well, I am here now.	14.33894610012186
Yes, I am here now.	13.985246471046828
Morning mouth bad images.	13.457026305932947
Got up wrong side of the bed.	12.487082899271273
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	9.168045951225967
On the hands down.	13.690670487099203
Blotchy brown brick houses.	12.301121235875009
Number eighty still unlet.	11.704433881450909
Why is that?	18.293832140145614
Valuation is only twentyeight.	14.638630770849803
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	5.9717222112390385
Plasters on a sore eye.	14.402920449094228
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	8.147414167853137
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	9.58095478848879
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	6.646389333659906
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	12.381269715339537
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	12.240099015695062
He stooped and gathered them.	11.00325514267822
Mrs Marion Bloom.	15.02979512606892
His quickened heart slowed at once.	8.959187637788615
Bold hand.	19.641756763843457
Mrs Marion.	16.610049399667975
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	6.928425507140826
— Who are the letters for?	13.877111924484634
He looked at them.	13.564780306013107
Mullingar.	34.226276693969254
Milly.	36.36718319993017
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	12.918971183004885
And a letter for you.	14.788236698731879
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	7.493354039100237
— Do you want the blind up?	10.954588523424956
— That do?	16.69728171266247
he asked, turning.	13.455158911011319
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	10.420078653745591
— She got the things, she said.	11.40582361321736
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	8.734999123634756
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	11.538428455002805
I ’ m parched.	12.667246757887193
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	8.930641468580568
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	7.646236173242725
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	11.905015512250726
— Scald the teapot.	13.032222647822456
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	8.300735674644123
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	7.605253972338413
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	7.483382152974113
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	7.664123435369367
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	10.97190024934853
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	13.929007105661514
Kosher.	37.032943096766246
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	7.677368940425997
Pepper.	44.19093781523242
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	9.803517758690678
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	6.2928658445391
The tea was drawn.	14.472015035561965
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	8.313924250043844
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	13.043400640207643
No, wait: four.	13.139613629262502
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	9.495818285207918
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	8.861499046297135
He smiled, pouring.	14.822593448574068
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	8.943685560745914
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	7.373285331755718
Poor old professor Goodwin.	14.675331121437287
Dreadful old case.	16.999541684099945
Still he was a courteous old chap.	13.01007205942232
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	10.585387519307465
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	11.777103443668363
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	10.36103176689322
Sex breaking out even then.	12.70281876879335
Pert little piece she was.	13.112467905957617
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	7.810748867813968
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	12.030166737140695
Everything on it?	22.286290596613835
Yes.	14.818606210850463
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	9.240937113408451
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	9.916998817337003
— What a time you were! she said.	9.796841015465962
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	6.445072841384085
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	8.43489299040828
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	7.88352484338661
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	8.2023582942744
— Who was the letter from?	15.109118283850743
he asked.	10.114487674314143
Bold hand.	19.641756763843457
Marion.	38.07587317658682
— O, Boylan, she said.	11.577047513482457
He ’ s bringing the programme.	11.244503905627615
— What are you singing?	13.761345664944278
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	7.2355627415909325
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	11.439487197194993
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	12.741792980441572
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	8.677896736172656
Like foul flowerwater.	15.286784431605385
— Would you like the window open a little?	13.440769427087533
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	11.40163458439094
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	13.880949990503472
I didn ’ t see the paper.	13.00122630444798
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	10.017019754575886
No?	28.942376964857253
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	6.497611279735119
— No: that book.	14.568866084271795
Other stocking.	21.893745608367293
Her petticoat.	24.366471759980033
— It must have fell down, she said.	10.614964742807897
He felt here and there.	13.748649587805545
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	10.493087966904168
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	8.817185820629486
Not in the bed.	15.171212895959231
Must have slid down.	13.463523577561682
He stooped and lifted the valance.	10.757612241914844
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	7.61132619397619
— Show here, she said.	11.8600342702995
I put a mark in it.	12.747264560388938
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	13.060468031809828
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	7.220048595351762
— Met him what?	16.16740478520558
he asked.	10.114487674314143
What does that mean?	14.570510397371718
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	9.293121319702426
— Metempsychosis?	22.17197924068506
— Yes.	10.03743100058611
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	17.068610000212416
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	11.998663233546813
That means the transmigration of souls.	10.114560722535206
— O, rocks! she said.	10.986246220136985
Tell us in plain words.	13.835104583375175
The same young eyes.	15.626609506996017
The first night after the charades.	13.337724256405489
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	11.734971391799963
He turned over the smudged pages.	10.22501347941999
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	10.593189893247805
Hello.	26.156206652584363
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip.	12.536354131047826

Sheet kindly lent.	17.089085099371555
_The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath_.	7.939745210728567
Cruelty behind it all.	17.657417942348612
Doped animals.	23.64427786929797
Trapeze at Hengler ’ s.	11.258771305723227
Had to look the other way.	14.9592864152838
Mob gaping.	23.89837015304178
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	11.725078023023126
Families of them.	19.08395091331855
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	11.254524183190977
That we live after death.	12.379395193436904
Our souls.	22.846639809443104
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	12.810609270740079
Dignam ’ s soul...	14.86538392462169
— Did you finish it?	12.4046939685163
he asked.	10.114487674314143
— Yes, she said.	10.127626740627417
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	10.485168851697848
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	13.90587969514368
— Never read it.	14.661290503157844
Do you want another?	16.09286176035701
— Yes.	10.03743100058611
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	9.52415722368321
Nice name he has.	17.246953309648177
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	9.794968831046038
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	7.959726866860054
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	17.049966737923114
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	10.872771070532579
They call it reincarnation.	14.53308312590184
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	10.179312508794613
They say we have forgotten it.	13.517789630903742
Some say they remember their past lives.	10.715239889457491
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	7.044570598925227
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	12.696817302750022
An example would be better.	14.696041709279323
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	9.074712334990936
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	6.778502775747148
Tea before you put milk in.	14.582168664866638
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	12.30127147328177
Three and six I gave for the frame.	12.564702956368016
She said it would look nice over the bed.	12.10554213564447
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	10.236774763438348
He turned the pages back.	11.955773823834395
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	10.156478587519276
What they called nymphs, for example.	12.531798801530897
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	10.606080462416124
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	8.475355760121305
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	9.626841008230693
Did you leave anything on the fire?	13.87912289987353
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	12.25968817037568
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	6.988063291801951
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	10.715805748589851
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	7.48974886256453
Only a little burnt.	16.777431555710592
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	8.302884735224545
Cup of tea now.	16.29193637711568
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	10.678063003170582
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	7.195283314818768
Done to a turn.	19.188913338277672
A mouthful of tea.	13.003319747567476
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	9.782792405422418
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	12.015919669740045
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	8.674678591371965
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	9.943419687110321
It suits me splendid.	12.935264767118532
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	10.675307657820532
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	8.457700446570982
They are lovely.	18.489966679327896
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	9.214268929302637
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	14.680326199635852
Will send when developed.	13.449044579135977
We did great biz yesterday.	11.360730825822406
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	12.559784079014964
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	8.795932266735498
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	9.599935583156963
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	14.492674344408586
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	10.562345180121735
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	7.521518318055862
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	8.792043078276508
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	6.624640040622222
S.	16.571640904015453
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	10.508070443411462
M.	18.390364149614893
Fifteen yesterday.	23.026015043367007
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	10.86650845046882
Her first birthday away from home.	11.995854747185431
Separation.	44.80800061837366
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	8.608687255119204
Jolly old woman.	21.372926555044817
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	10.084128352894751
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	10.745036704287218
Well, God is good, sir.	12.953731003355982
She knew at once.	14.514736891146645
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	11.550652520850411
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	7.959606916303645
Excuse bad writing.	16.07076590139828
Hurry.	37.39931712164559
Piano downstairs.	21.06986321828872
Coming out of her shell.	18.260201883767323
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	10.368562814594908
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	9.352589303094435
Saucebox.	44.80800061837366
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	7.228368668304115
Twelve and six a week.	14.988943610458433
Not much.	23.13262706068385
Still, she might do worse.	13.81708777858267
Music hall stage.	17.286243747563798
Young student.	17.447519706190963
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	8.088929111131733
Then he read the letter again: twice.	12.62887169231689
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	11.334595270404753
But if not?	20.441565582908495
No, nothing has happened.	13.129840730394093
Wait in any case till it does.	13.310613849347018
A wild piece of goods.	12.210719791636256
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	10.901561352089491
Destiny.	35.564133659099035
Ripening now.	22.76427436003776
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	9.5046500510084
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	11.539650681911827
Anemic a little.	22.2542661167203
Was given milk too long.	14.214372685267877
Damned old tub pitching about.	9.612224270401091
Not a bit funky.	14.61257381283894
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	11.203772827821636
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	7.881272557050851
Seaside girls.	25.337055106599
Torn envelope.	22.76816743065165
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	11.779027798229384
Friend of the family.	18.223471322360506
Swurls, he says.	19.221009355581952
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	9.217812503636587
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	8.648492110917083
Milly too.	23.50007983857657
Young kisses: the first.	15.637504231491866
Far away now past.	14.797118391594749
Mrs Marion.	16.610049399667975
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	8.702076012283358
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	6.951169623131349
Will happen, yes.	13.750607473234421
Prevent.	44.80800061837366
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	11.365417959263269
Will happen too.	16.298227001075848
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	8.744719107350416
Useless to move now.	14.864810859602356
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	12.672821359007994
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	12.668519676251902
Better where she is down there: away.	14.788392822969348
Occupy her.	24.39348522285047
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	12.061979120989468
Might take a trip down there.	11.360177535047205
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	11.12110739476687
Six weeks off, however.	14.21341783486529
Might work a press pass.	13.862213872245599
Or through M ’ Coy.	12.774657349257764
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	7.348395788959933
She looked back at him, mewing.	14.158189511808644
Wants to go out.	19.136894852850308
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	11.553346229205285
Let her wait.	16.757092534234886
Has the fidgets.	17.6318655738276
Electric.	44.19093781523242
Thunder in the air.	16.676250473740296
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	12.516766881217924
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	9.997019440865616
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	9.145502276215952
The cat mewed to him.	11.143459711725074
— Miaow! he said in answer.	13.764952194008824
Wait till I ’ m ready.	13.623838622178729
Heaviness: hot day coming.	11.602565201296114
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	9.31992275654103
A paper.	22.479642162927625
He liked to read at stool.	11.907620709296111
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	10.343860403743827
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	8.719897335681175
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	11.88908233819655
The cat went up in soft bounds.	11.036457437609808
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	9.92524291207986
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	13.604887317739102
Come.	22.108245157254114
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	9.502749771417628
No sound.	19.908853261184188
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	11.616440622764552
The maid was in the garden.	14.757465779483072
Fine morning.	24.44742437173584
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	7.416982777427812
Make a summerhouse here.	11.8971626494645
Scarlet runners.	23.3898409561541
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	8.435653345593003
A coat of liver of sulphur.	10.74127226479724
All soil like that without dung.	11.54060293118197
Household slops.	23.174055911093696
Loam, what is this that is?	17.870258295502747
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	8.792900021789007
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	9.523820723172328
Mulch of dung.	17.955142805218625
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	10.639347094635458
Dirty cleans.	20.750099931067716
Ashes too.	22.76639465348193
Reclaim the whole place.	17.323472362826497
Grow peas in that corner there.	12.432164674434846
Lettuce.	44.80800061837366
Always have fresh greens then.	10.589243589380457
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	11.31942142530942
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	8.76903905333
He walked on.	14.206730939498529
Where is my hat, by the way?	17.13639829505353
Must have put it back on the peg.	14.549099776632426
Or hanging up on the floor.	14.39786179060932
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	15.073715221009746
Hallstand too full.	17.165849413666106
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	12.442475877785611
Picking up the letters.	17.067084720059466
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	12.373257554283022
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	14.273378354484814
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	12.951015058092786
Just had a wash and brushup.	12.284408640745982
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	11.797095005358377
Tara street.	24.243888429367257
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	8.01166857294307
O ’ Brien.	15.087564295850553
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	13.277036274913305
Agendath what is it?	17.794611490393866
Now, my miss.	16.327768672923003
Enthusiast.	44.80800061837366
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	11.062213722375935
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	9.531218550742398
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	10.460267909692467
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	6.332961020621171
The king was in his countinghouse.	14.880321953061161
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	8.142960158077337
Something new and easy.	15.148679479583775
No great hurry.	16.28979007573542
Keep it a bit.	19.083122020971143
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	8.170131523509593
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	8.142289483584134
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	8.833243003992374
Three and a half.	21.335398930806686
Three pounds three.	18.098276940025567
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	10.218251224269318
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	8.460883438256348
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	6.522546088403742
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	10.506912871844262
No, just right.	16.711112557020968
So. Ah! Costive.	11.146405673861185
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	7.981006011146655
Life might be so.	18.325424382410976
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	10.98508764651925
Print anything now.	16.370635693558217
Silly season.	23.173564984277345
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	10.402452296736021
Neat certainly.	25.87188866224582
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	8.902881732156702
Begins and ends morally.	11.774074388993217
_Hand in hand_.	14.597298375078251
Smart.	45.61529184064059
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	7.770162788483608
Might manage a sketch.	11.195078749239531

Which?	39.41152492568273
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	9.80465153124803
Dislike dressing together.	16.26248363320698
Nicked myself shaving.	16.594056539882683
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	7.364373623804574
Timing her.	24.39348522285047

What had Gretta Conroy on?	10.76425846686715
What possessed me to buy this comb?	12.276621721360998
<URL>.	24.6924490659658
I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	10.082859743358686
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	8.62382727586141
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	8.263689418086784
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	7.500890507585433
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	9.871576945069462
Washing her teeth.	17.60331634844934
That was the first night.	17.111597462592528
Her fansticks clicking.	12.362725118617593
Is that Boylan well off?	13.265537534728173
He has money.	16.608343730005757
Why?	18.42545846291693
No use humming then.	13.018582861061136
Allude to it.	18.901706522921767
Strange kind of music that last night.	12.817379771988668
The mirror was in shadow.	14.351568853472651
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	6.940473500363018
Peering into it.	20.354619271005106
Lines in her eyes.	18.149251709439437
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	11.231675450658834
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	11.70272442188499
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	7.341082097687343
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	10.460282173260463
Still, true to life also.	12.884544647654444
Day: then the night.	17.903277811254316
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	8.15954002265083
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	7.975531114882006
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	8.22283685415868
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	7.0303763428059
What time is the funeral?	15.770149886021303
Better find out in the paper.	16.457456737522975
The bells of George ’ s church.	10.664076456016156
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	9.604542698907219
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	6.316590759010134
There again: the overtone following through the air.	9.91642774808225
A third.	25.149551845784128
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	6.1165142826256504
Could have given that address too.	12.222670758643448
And past the sailors ’ home.	12.193291694160816
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	8.383233059542793
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	6.590469049572055
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	6.745973669761108
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	12.109313654760076
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	11.68098675376578
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	9.494439775176325
Come home to ma, da.	12.440056027716633
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	12.045483662207031
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	8.441195326684513
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	10.087317667564154
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	9.20313608628312
At eleven it is.	15.056800896542912
Time enough.	18.704759952470784
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	8.648987956031544
Corny.	40.27872070012825
Met her once in the park.	14.171490638994369
What a lark.	14.507489498451353
Police tout.	23.08118405530159
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	8.851305879746521
O, surely he bagged it.	9.985814056914151
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	11.24878133508813
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	8.167655515792843
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	6.07123222061862
Rather warm.	24.718786021614356
Tea.	32.13850438451833
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	11.123211873663347
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	13.519965731478953
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	8.276326055013342
Very warm morning.	17.42657519894291
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	7.364428443835577
Just there.	24.137180953541208
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	12.264637846530484
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	8.57113610172569
So warm.	24.663715210031665
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	9.721259768578896
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	9.072846848187043
The far east.	15.553145102975268
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	6.8406670423898115
Wonder is it like that.	16.298625078425502
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	7.979903761647846
Sleep six months out of twelve.	11.967969579425814
Too hot to quarrel.	12.840316653909692
Influence of the climate.	16.817971036500865
Lethargy.	44.19093781523242
Flowers of idleness.	14.486067489739066
The air feeds most.	11.8586793972831
Azotes.	44.80800061837366
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	11.787657338006632
Sensitive plants.	22.35662508074605
Waterlilies.	44.80800061837366
Petals too tired to.	15.169952070710185
Sleeping sickness in the air.	12.900866490903656
Walk on roseleaves.	15.21713723174829
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	9.199140956882092
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	13.335634080065297
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	11.421485070720307
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	8.766373910105402
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	11.535807391047012
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	11.627267719745275
It ’ s a law something like that.	11.220026101760228
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	7.700791454458619
The college curriculum.	14.623161656388175
Cracking curriculum.	20.750072132806967
What is weight really when you say the weight?	11.393324871478239
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	11.931715811725566
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	9.375902936517404
They all fall to the ground.	12.375312229109777
The earth.	21.515455781562736
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	10.758736023807373
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	9.361564486733936
How did she walk with her sausages?	12.626823663947476
Like that something.	19.378530043316363
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	7.093037145844296
Careless air: just drop in to see.	12.08579813111474
Per second per second.	13.140561414500077
Per second for every second it means.	11.651263266249812
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	9.63695051894923
Too late box.	16.019914314951443
Post here.	24.493869060628285
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	9.324873970148948
— Are there any letters for me?	11.878826920708981
he asked.	10.114487674314143
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	6.392122832991003
No answer probably.	16.298873469443176
Went too far last time.	13.946297990308251
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	9.289731664905585
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	9.278315795821474
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	7.8514165961399
O.	16.60830871151788
Westland Row, City.	14.736175971506517
Answered anyhow.	21.96946614486798
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	7.510098745895308
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	12.037682543615826
Castoff soldier.	23.706610725482605
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	8.12679683316845
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	14.92336245300201
Pointed cuffs.	20.487164663877625
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	10.384792145549723
Redcoats.	44.80800061837366
Too showy.	19.98956693594679
That must be why the women go after them.	11.670717081567373
Uniform.	44.19093781523242
Easier to enlist and drill.	9.481373498081195
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	9.023563000231462
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	7.033132607181986
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	9.608966824294045
Mark time.	24.549050821726272
Table: able.	17.094930944254138
Bed: ed.	14.609046625888158
The King ’ s own.	14.906085085369257
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	9.678631550833261
A mason, yes.	13.319904516138719
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	11.207279946128086
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	12.102547115821618
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	8.308132734836887
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	9.752770042163863
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	9.186874001956506
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	11.31322328394991
No. M ’ Coy.	12.688966909620222
Get rid of him quickly.	14.45664788992223
Take me out of my way.	17.732955550562227
Hate company when you.	15.592776589182684
— Hello, Bloom.	11.580153026283297
Where are you off to?	17.10579046795935
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	10.816287743583635
Nowhere in particular.	18.04500724393429
— How ’ s the body?	16.792805466748458
— Fine.	22.40940423996969
How are you?	17.246588506513408
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	8.228257051777106
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	9.573935943674208
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	11.219688977913632
Poor Dignam, you know.	16.011640510253727
The funeral is today.	12.889192382321571
— To be sure, poor fellow.	13.514641317719375
So it is.	17.944355129985002
What time?	21.540501150969316
A photo it isn ’ t.	10.961754724296727
A badge maybe.	15.665087106061634
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	13.114352288157386
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	10.140141206224843
Eleven, is it?	18.426831040921428
I only heard it last night.	13.202085686042713
Who was telling me?	15.21661527670208
Holohan.	48.81773021153708
You know Hoppy?	16.9407014972533
— I know.	11.739256161144255
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	10.473329860034841
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	10.685796793473012
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	10.139393853933795
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	8.647138678018575
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	12.578958352018923
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	8.933083780529184
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	10.586435246559702
Handsome is and handsome does.	12.164206452516954
Reserved about to yield.	15.47994001837212
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	8.915673580602567
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	10.66546517075059
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	11.185886652309776
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	12.241885403610118
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	10.921359642143678
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	12.582618857033687
In came Hoppy.	16.665929540282633
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	8.081045561382327
Clearly I can see today.	16.244673078398435
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	9.793352945834528
Talking of one thing or another.	13.78919093969356
Lady ’ s hand.	17.10550481375549
Which side will she get up?	12.266759062882594
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	8.494257389231908
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	9.853195756370125
High brown boots with laces dangling.	10.737455834750882
Wellturned foot.	23.992807508852117
What is he foostering over that change for?	10.138003394724187
Sees me looking.	18.54638498153897
Eye out for other fellow always.	15.65000641537821
Good fallback.	20.796224737461134
Two strings to her bow.	14.735536746429158
— _Why? _ I said.	12.735395969204495
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	13.853683901483254
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	9.870666526618447
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	7.737319950758759
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	11.097092641625128
Getting up in a minute.	18.247205901655413
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	10.368326996494694
He said.	15.394613756347065
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	9.783940160578885
And, faith, he filled up.	11.771428527265773
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	13.994688865325916
I said.	15.377459293500705
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	13.004217508279318
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	9.571601011923827
_Yes, _ he said.	13.649391696100036
_He ’ s gone.	16.9715304487932
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	11.536355118520536
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	8.37012826492419
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	7.064962085044371
Lost it.	23.78521342094376
Curse your noisy pugnose.	12.15086232282867
Feels locked out of it.	13.6201246971268
Paradise and the peri.	15.190565583216246
Always happening like that.	13.953574974640112
The very moment.	16.568184245359436
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	7.81875094210739
Her friend covering the display of.	10.21503574257297
_Esprit de corps_.	14.546239980037658
Well, what are you gaping at?	14.233831470221427
Another gone.	23.338876151025044
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	10.619465157259816
The tram passed.	17.366086140488
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	7.745537065492937
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	8.220726114961414
— Wife well, I suppose?	16.469983297284717
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	9.284536939033636
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	9.964651600653387
Tiptop, thanks.	17.380001275803785
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	7.0574457600996645
Incomplete.	31.06813240985959
With it an abode of bliss.	7.999402941639296
— My missus has just got an engagement.	9.498785606254916
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	14.209756472291291
Valise tack again.	15.407916376696196
By the way no harm.	13.3719456844625
I ’ m off that, thanks.	11.058789800594592
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	7.746314186454069
— My wife too, he said.	11.901075739082485
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	8.16776589640116
— That so?	13.356811734294967
M ’ Coy said.	9.239765378394694
Glad to hear that, old man.	16.45659424724309
Who ’ s getting it up?	13.345712002384523
Mrs Marion Bloom.	15.02979512606892
Not up yet.	16.578518281078512
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	12.821706676150185
No book.	24.305425965685448
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	7.3525904667700575
Dark lady and fair man.	12.53317667977254
Letter.	43.051840588071244
Cat furry black ball.	12.63583389827764
Torn strip of envelope.	12.938597840010965
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	7.44425323287836
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	12.092035997633092
_Sweeeet song_.	19.669709954004386
There ’ s a committee formed.	12.668845462772369
Part shares and part profits.	8.89181957606547
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	10.089218120270926
— O, well, he said.	11.636986542781452
That ’ s good news.	12.779455963143361
He moved to go.	16.031145582860727
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	9.545104743107908
Meet you knocking around.	13.436919426889359
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	7.737319950758759
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	9.271404607439411
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	10.945254585226236
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	10.781078532980349
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	9.117150126354565
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	11.877873751862094
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	11.90245690461849
That ’ ll be all right.	10.158524163175993
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	10.552619279868997
Thanks, old man.	16.362321810238537
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	11.350836307893253
Well, tolloll.	15.48046130521987
Just C.	21.73896584203508
P.	14.020800208276315
M ’ Coy will do.	13.026936586001279
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	12.311974441605416
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	8.563894921708444
The quick touch.	16.87305053458409
Soft mark.	24.345534262319816
I ’ d like my job.	12.875782194555192
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	14.58098593105631
Leather.	44.80800061837366
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	6.591648024730489
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	8.917029377884221
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	8.888799584951288
My missus has just got an.	11.074216301590681
Reedy freckled soprano.	12.941717684187884
Cheeseparing nose.	23.19542446535883
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	13.773021677008558
No guts in it.	15.989291888269555
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	12.384141126584993
Softsoaping.	44.80800061837366
Give you the needle that would.	13.422197484985366
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	13.041089107245373
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	14.44592846651063
Against my grain somehow.	12.458339858472284
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	9.701936170462275
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	9.932299661496454
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	9.513210934755467
Your wife and my wife.	16.79050574335299
Wonder is he pimping after me?	11.886526045821816
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	10.785584363592541
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	6.933829722653668
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	11.093145015381568
No, he ’ s going on straight.	14.7211769911786
Hello.	26.156206652584363
_Leah_ tonight.	24.733567433599067
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	13.418398340353589
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	12.718505440352589
Male impersonator.	23.3898409561541
Perhaps he was a woman.	20.256779302512516
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	11.627365467298224
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	8.746928448018831
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	9.19072760953425
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	14.00425777697822
And Ristori in Vienna.	11.252087114258597
What is this the right name is?	14.278459131542167
By Mosenthal it is.	13.789804203547671
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	8.884783081313113
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	10.703558956859082
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	11.002816120298396
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	10.161732033571829
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	9.79161736411552
No use thinking of it any more.	13.526433793601607
Nosebag time.	23.12292336724621
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	9.877717898158117
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	7.206093721576612
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	8.461293752685927
Their Eldorado.	20.551659988991915
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	7.496971759626219
Too full for words.	12.494081932090314
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	11.83253454789962
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	8.486798498716302
Might be happy all the same that way.	13.006209857085667
Good poor brutes they look.	12.834003758969635
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	8.699855580371397
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	11.68881656502329
Might just walk into her here.	11.548558555299062
The lane is safer.	12.023165239246751
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	11.102726351484225
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	10.918428359409837
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	8.475404310477058
_Voglio e non_.	14.046834987520858
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	12.824536561331412
Sociable.	44.80800061837366
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	10.175276330497327
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	5.439545464435292
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	8.010216479830357
No - one.	13.231919638003063
Meade ’ s timberyard.	14.820655010899934
Piled balks.	19.669699536138168
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	8.220617495718418
Not a sinner.	17.649531594023514
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	6.313443971770105
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	7.815546384300982
Pity to disturb them.	13.661784797770522
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	11.171592829862732
Open it.	24.11797033321075
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	9.979176919671344
She liked mignonette.	14.93920231600431
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	14.143764950966068
And Mr?	24.16683923080157
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	12.857724934078496
A flower.	24.765810653642298
I think it ’ s a.	16.264867394891592
Not annoyed then?	16.00465379943355
What does she say?	16.841198471494383
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	10.642971096760544
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	11.653477017527322
Why did you enclose the stamps?	10.459555629282871
I am awfully angry with you.	10.98696908988463
I do wish I could punish you for that.	11.402931312418138
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	9.305108998864146
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	12.374317875324785
I do wish I could do something for you.	12.813241308450284
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	13.243516749098047
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	13.736377939510435
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	12.524325192814931
I think of you so often you have no idea.	12.504171349220394
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	11.007595207767737
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	12.995532013333857
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	13.909051256347082
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	13.693486455772572
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	8.616933162539018
Then I will tell you all.	12.703766512081144
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	11.897316167500831
today.	33.62271918995197
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	6.425200103352451
S.	16.571640904015453
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	10.749976857830001
I want to know.	14.230642035428197
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	7.805815203576218
They like it because no - one can hear.	12.96205419124606
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	9.662542398897633
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	10.283077198433961
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	5.511327010540408
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	12.356805348482927
Weak joy opened his lips.	12.464919005558004
Changed since the first letter.	16.322855155452306
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	13.766589871308135
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	9.102542266813845
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	10.820207978068149
Thank you: not having any.	13.756064910040338
Usual love scrimmage.	15.668829424179163
Then running round corners.	13.864121031257438
Bad as a row with Molly.	14.970988396643381
Cigar has a cooling effect.	12.20204177826622
Narcotic.	44.80800061837366
Go further next time.	13.658794966494087
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	9.995032696370837
Brutal, why not?	17.035484503039058
A bit at a time.	14.626365016164447
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	12.046077183039591
Common pin, eh?	13.67463133514761
He threw it on the road.	14.451487935754765
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	9.946637249401546
Queer the number of pins they always have.	10.794587263096647
No roses without thorns.	12.807630321623474
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	10.866837776164958
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	10.123981999621247
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	9.568722757246986
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	9.517778740237677
It?	36.30565636296497
Them.	47.12018689325502
Such a bad headache.	14.125208776648813
Has her roses probably.	12.799493519671445
Or sitting all day typing.	12.322492602539839
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	12.031669805776724
What perfume does your wife use.	9.821137099935084
Now could you make out a thing like that?	15.195808182433055
To keep it up.	11.637937732503614
Martha, Mary.	21.684589135997857
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	7.938422701669488
He is sitting in their house, talking.	13.417028006187254
Mysterious.	44.19093781523242
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	10.792443889195356
To keep it up.	11.637937732503614
Nice kind of evening feeling.	13.339111949523254
No more wandering about.	13.98287786981994
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	7.979201486497632
Forget.	43.051840588071244
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	10.920631916403792
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	7.908144373936635
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	10.621398241831663
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	9.704263155317422
Tell her: more and more: all.	13.564190432889914
Then a sigh: silence.	11.88829819280497
Long long long rest.	16.03448766825237
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	8.092585475349786
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	8.739340852532761
Henry Flower.	23.708612236071314
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	11.462500020262306
Simple bit of paper.	16.888183296172055
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	7.269293654470663
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	13.24338122015083
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	8.886930986222325
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	9.476897566300504
A million pounds, wait a moment.	11.52132337167217
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	7.7081528151236505
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	9.336770492261397
Yes, exactly.	18.184504756351853
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	11.088449509515481
What am I saying barrels?	13.606852194579874
Gallons.	44.80800061837366
About a million barrels all the same.	12.019402351803738
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	7.815180940690392
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	7.829529062829684
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	6.136883818154053
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	9.156811354439167
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	9.858485064192873
Damn it.	23.044172412892724
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	10.09752025220007
Same notice on the door.	14.338070641900366
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	10.099323136273409

Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	9.708038112319972
The protestants are the same.	15.103441263812861
Convert Dr William J.	12.739276876814422
Walsh <URL>. to the true religion.	13.506929496871006
Save China ’ s millions.	12.465285579423899
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	9.827398406537691
Prefer an ounce of opium.	10.771879928903214
Celestials.	44.80800061837366
Rank heresy for them.	12.295480754521343
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	11.71922398148326
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	10.780262299130472
Not like Ecce Homo.	10.316255865532662
Crown of thorns and cross.	11.197835671666002
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	10.770656543635862
Chopsticks?	44.699101331895235
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	10.294219790891082
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	7.987007092280042
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	8.116452283421717
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	10.718239773035094
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	8.638613234259285
Still life.	22.957861882365176
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	15.033269100695575
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	9.585617961460585
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	7.4528161573699885
Something going on: some sodality.	13.382592492488897
Pity so empty.	17.252102275301667
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	10.55076977712935
Who is my neighbour?	19.032200275311645
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	13.357640545524868
That woman at midnight mass.	13.546561267844702
Seventh heaven.	25.68841970489397
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	6.836716401221963
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	11.054709023240553
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	11.695306039332175
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	8.606334214516073
Her hat and head sank.	14.151070821307714
Then the next one.	14.249357350828804
Her hat sank at once.	12.107193460906025
Then the next one: a small old woman.	12.451729059470553
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	12.33432519660593
Latin.	46.789504768224276
The next one.	17.77768370731603
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	11.252278623160437
What?	14.626800461768257
_Corpus: _ body.	16.140794155015286
Corpse.	43.60652022518163
Good idea the Latin.	13.603555634592087
Stupefies them first.	18.10058581902829
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	9.088182664290636
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	10.576711380881767
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	8.456638035873201
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	8.260449584670358
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	9.24641530508038
These pots we have to wear.	15.156340099174006
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	10.086102654168426
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	8.909659907573676
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	9.523805203161379
Look at them.	18.723340313571807
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	11.394385039893756
Lollipop.	44.80800061837366
It does.	22.65867610053864
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	11.323976124752708
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	9.28110614153078
Hokypoky penny a lump.	14.264009163289636
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	10.112731962610928
They do.	23.802542312877208
I ’ m sure of that.	11.548305697375358
Not so lonely.	17.944459800827076
In our confraternity.	16.03209050799917
Then come out a bit spreeish.	14.302389049377956
Let off steam.	17.440935335800926
Thing is if you really believe in it.	11.128523701877164
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	8.385739324135978
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	9.772120785320139
Hence those snores.	14.60332770005928
Blind faith.	21.70516074317872
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	11.836565302891666
Lulls all pain.	16.191172870654068
Wake this time next year.	14.083091180116268
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	8.313653699163728
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	12.858722339308668
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	13.108860820182398
Bald spot behind.	17.081643502758137
Letters on his back: <URL>	25.377402691864773
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	12.090034758808848
And the other one?	17.196500264699946
Iron nails ran in.	13.524841659380797
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	11.325124454781756
Do not deny my request.	11.600711163651448
Dusk and the light behind her.	16.003724044600233
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	11.249242489183917
Their character.	22.851519783329795
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	8.776433851570367
This very church.	17.5581315402947
Peter Carey, yes.	15.07311316487959
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	11.082351462026944
Denis Carey.	25.804215886350423
And just imagine that.	15.437353018939026
Wife and six children at home.	12.339646910671304
And plotting that murder all the time.	9.859243568235756
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	11.78767103093203
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	10.305174969742868
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	14.192275038678613
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	12.321337284315636
Yes: under the bridge.	14.139749122230075
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	7.768056125647935
Wine.	37.39931712164559
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	6.292116067306209
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	11.202962753954418
Cold comfort.	23.917182383220638
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	7.474851698523855
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	13.653704725265614
Quite right.	17.455650413019644
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	12.69194416206015
Not going to be any music.	14.147673231752158
Pity.	30.766957684662835
Who has the organ here I wonder?	14.350288895411229
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	8.133800606538195
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	10.561403515999311
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	9.289165000607206
Christ or Pilate?	18.07880635493808
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	11.559202298080987
Music they wanted.	19.45066596394146
Footdrill stopped.	22.292421882329965
Could hear a pin drop.	13.083135376857886
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	10.19875580251024
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	8.63085163915191
Mercadante: seven last words.	12.095137038230302
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	8.938958186452185
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	7.81591501287046
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	9.83337963327635
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	8.770037908664692
Benedictine.	44.80800061837366
Green Chartreuse.	21.87797932654633
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	10.446493335937726
What kind of voice is it?	14.098297397469569
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	9.216622174745295
Connoisseurs.	44.80800061837366
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	12.226594942152825
Kind of a placid.	15.609729113940011
No worry.	20.631651786223955
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	12.556420943578187
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	12.888517857084693
Who knows?	21.314446453094185
One way out of it.	14.837092060404506
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	9.349241039851604
All crossed themselves and stood up.	12.549814916293029
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	10.936349933484305
Stand up at the gospel of course.	14.034236500382548
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	10.461915393536113
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	11.07185521916649
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	10.368419423959232
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	11.69823863414221
English.	44.83853802833482
Throw them the bone.	16.709873153906138
I remember slightly.	18.031959958280883
How long since your last mass?	12.85561294434962
Glorious and immaculate virgin.	12.197169713244078
Joseph, her spouse.	17.067818915688925
Peter and Paul.	18.110977660158564
More interesting if you understood what it was all about.	12.926134173841223
Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	8.078588423362069
Confession.	44.80800061837366
Everyone wants to.	19.054511420703637
Then I will tell you all.	12.703766512081144
Penance.	44.19093781523242
Punish me, please.	16.11660714623716
Great weapon in their hands.	15.376460020328858
More than doctor or solicitor.	11.795612856890648
Woman dying to.	20.878270863872253
And I schschschschschsch.	13.801388936721956
And did you chachachachacha?	14.255830450339271
And why did you?	18.607130674877716
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	10.520761846674707
Husband learn to his surprise.	14.87533368400132
God ’ s little joke.	16.936894758023314
Then out she comes.	13.553606482625597
Repentance skindeep.	19.669709954004386
Lovely shame.	24.431796522662967
Pray at an altar.	16.848918411880163
Hail Mary and Holy Mary.	13.300515313906185

Salvation army blatant imitation.	12.157123977612928
Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.	10.939391976608063
How I found the Lord.	15.549581088563794
Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show.	9.35187666211804
And don ’ t they rake in the money too?	11.969044542192256
Bequests also: to the <URL>. for the time being in his absolute discretion.	10.651458878661565
Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.	9.793117170305864
Monasteries and convents.	14.586516791990464
No browbeating him.	14.491436978137937
He had his answer pat for everything.	9.88281671707733
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	9.311528406233453
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	7.782090282650583
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	7.221764057787737
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	11.628274500858623
All over.	24.16554040272686
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	10.6748295269444
Brother Buzz.	23.484912027211468
Come around with the plate perhaps.	12.416503887726808
Pay your Easter duty.	13.488079178245362
He stood up.	13.499301768639345
Hello.	26.156206652584363
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	11.631059457582547
Women enjoy it.	16.688737980244056
Never tell you.	18.186227162847267
But we.	23.369121545149643
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	9.490303823856609
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	9.36313718535161
Glimpses of the moon.	16.436912836444826
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	12.659874583768687
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	14.2747558827237
Still like you better untidy.	13.573391294785344
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	11.802604437237061
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	8.412208450374793
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	7.00197218792239
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	9.404485563171264
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	13.961920619120512
He covered himself.	18.06005697992669
How goes the time?	16.93713816245673
Quarter past.	25.35777494502525
Time enough yet.	16.38232416050575
Better get that lotion made up.	13.488814501788067
Ah yes, the last time.	14.970180465695547
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	14.772284391961472
Chemists rarely move.	14.755449582515032
Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.	9.403767298826356
Hamilton Long ’ s, founded in the year of the flood.	12.428181662126434
Huguenot churchyard near there.	13.245505525719981
Visit some day.	18.713412497847404
He walked southward along Westland row.	9.325798889220568
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	13.707385106108319
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	12.053298153687658
Bore this funeral affair.	12.933663949730787
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	15.862872773949459
When was it I got it made up last?	14.04309930070343
Wait.	16.117996620458218
I changed a sovereign I remember.	12.029977566054834
First of the month it must have been or the second.	13.412405194875117
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	11.819429096431476
The chemist turned back page after page.	9.994317505973058
Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have.	10.719279545271815
Shrunken skull.	21.50881284495168
And old.	23.87307474466127

Lethargy then.	24.0236162581171
Why?	18.42545846291693
Reaction.	44.80800061837366
A lifetime in a night.	14.307032193405162
Gradually changes your character.	12.354258418304154
Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.	8.348717927942856
All his alabaster lilypots.	10.945588882114986

Doctor Whack.	21.94930954796648
He ought to physic himself a bit.	11.447585049190454
Electuary or emulsion.	14.615166673033784
The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck.	8.950815375522286
Simples.	44.80800061837366
Want to be careful.	17.287058258633273

Clever of nature.	19.480517406146774
— About a fortnight ago, sir?	11.864088573205553
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	7.737319950758759
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	6.831735739843438
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	8.355534115420383
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	8.262936926110582
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	8.607141772164082
— And white wax also, he said.	9.099041051060349
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	14.436691932839864
Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs.	9.932929746285433

Three we have.	21.629638040230027
Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse.	9.457133688814457

That orangeflower water is so fresh.	13.093844631272944
Nice smell these soaps have.	11.200644323790055
Pure curd soap.	14.155184455394389
Time to get a bath round the corner.	13.577447148803497
Hammam.	44.80800061837366
Turkish.	41.7339802402361
Massage.	44.80800061837366
Dirt gets rolled up in your navel.	12.79837451882571
Nicer if a nice girl did it.	12.791231638795773
Also I think I.	19.244705661181598
Yes I.	23.16358505558319
Do it in the bath.	17.99759399886692
Curious longing I.	16.654511592924283
Water to water.	16.692893778831852
Combine business with pleasure.	15.030910334651704
Pity no time for massage.	13.384584390222718
Feel fresh then all the day.	14.60135777116091
Funeral be rather glum.	12.233006926866382
That was two and nine.	13.769046886709836
Have you brought a bottle?	15.50008736469914
— No, Mr Bloom said.	8.798071943558138
Make it up, please.	17.331484494035394
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	11.819881362249124
— Fourpence, sir.	11.512224896114729
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	10.435285736906295
Sweet lemony wax.	14.616226859866202
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	9.458482388172909
That makes three and a penny.	14.34986964118299
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	9.330955994169434
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	12.855840751847118
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	10.33497169179643
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	8.862487925544945
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	10.068584300554988
What ’ s the best news?	12.107033619080333
Is that today ’ s?	13.686122570201325
Show us a minute.	16.50243557655863
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	9.039344297807283
He does look balmy.	13.38861519091711
Younger than I am.	16.87260003749333
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	7.349677343498647
Wants a wash too.	14.285708964700929
Take off the rough dirt.	13.767414107366937
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	10.81063535493039
Dandruff on his shoulders.	17.070858135574575
Scalp wants oiling.	14.505599666762954
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	9.169871043266888
Where the bugger is it?	12.075420060884353
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	7.426380737551774
Barber ’ s itch.	14.690495250248619
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	13.443353452540396
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	12.63110939265269
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	10.045913054883748
— Ascot.	23.483688303097267
Gold cup.	19.81342979404447
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	12.01843842467856
Half a mo.	17.01781465091333
Maximum the second.	20.919553252947463
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	10.128451665479632
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	9.34978739630556
— What ’ s that?	10.254129274625361
his sharp voice said.	6.83310772389827
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	12.708045064483004
I was going to throw it away that moment.	12.495791118339394
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	8.714282910100337
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	9.697036641782665
Here, thanks.	17.304595459869343
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	9.674359866836491
God speed scut.	14.435919313003378
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	9.179318962001133
Silly lips of that chap.	16.621785494629965
Betting.	44.19093781523242
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	11.343707234990774
Raffle for large tender turkey.	10.736877934514956
Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	10.766922061844866
Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	6.538554854849733
Keeps a hotel now.	13.06205866059849
They never come back.	15.58857068479208
Fleshpots of Egypt.	19.60427664247452
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	8.226395308411115
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	7.995324985734429
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	7.03064009832007
Damn bad ad.	17.040685265525802
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	12.862382495842356
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	6.921500930479707
Something to catch the eye.	13.794526666041383
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	10.489339215546808
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	11.006025138368033
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	13.519916384709274
How do you do, sir?	13.740815229597105
Heavenly weather really.	16.3812468077408
If life was always like that.	14.621085183330932
Cricket weather.	22.942915403229918
Sit around under sunshades.	12.704295716633046
Over after over.	18.05680512725297
Out.	30.126521725037115
They can ’ t play it here.	12.363695092434877
Duck for six wickets.	12.858286239405544
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	6.934476890680309
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	14.208314587212149
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	7.885414505805778
Heatwave.	44.80800061837366
Won ’ t last.	16.63274670633367
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	8.5477350555461
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	7.97089582567681
This is my body.	17.85803841903497
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	7.324794886054888
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	6.044675837031956
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	9.033249978993402
— Come on, Simon.	12.419266333389677
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	10.9643212961697
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	10.856297511759905
— Are we all here now?	13.30389622538217
Martin Cunningham asked.	12.879891768174636
Come along, Bloom.	17.006358889359994
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	10.318031001092823
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	9.468112117659665
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	7.215623704379396
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	12.31050791301142
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	11.996778922424351
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	10.962695272925638
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	9.95957841206481
Job seems to suit them.	12.368520423272773
Huggermugger in corners.	15.338425901848613
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	11.450149129724078
Then getting it ready.	14.513464220682781
Laying it out.	19.985876251410158
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	12.330606129517713
Pull it more to your side.	14.897158401809289
Our windingsheet.	21.207529419695504
Never know who will touch you dead.	11.367117175299729
Wash and shampoo.	14.586533397380395
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	10.129715753400333
Keep a bit in an envelope.	15.234517144167746
Grows all the same after.	19.209092894644424
Unclean job.	22.84966471736398
All waited.	19.76993309810959
Nothing was said.	17.368654035286763
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	12.180346655020104
I am sitting on something hard.	11.472961680276399
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	11.008670695902483
Better shift it out of that.	15.202216484190883
Wait for an opportunity.	17.171716416586374
All waited.	19.76993309810959
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	8.639599728772033
A jolt.	22.32113799667934
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	9.709655465313862
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	9.268596900376181
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	6.780103642478139
At walking pace.	18.279271803865417
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	8.99733012891135
Tritonville road.	24.92646769493617
Quicker.	44.19093781523242
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	6.549755686365314
— What way is he taking us?	11.842505707455363
Mr Power asked through both windows.	10.330582191926826
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	8.73975020451397
Ringsend.	50.56150090684935
Brunswick street.	25.729616355982277
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	12.60519266879214
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	8.908147370449456
I am glad to see it has not died out.	12.148446659365888
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	7.57251843738764
Respect.	47.12018689325502
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	6.610909438453368
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	8.629658757857415
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	10.100887378238214
— Who is that?	14.505951477283762
— Your son and heir.	13.450413656118645
— Where is he?	14.323881018328876
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	9.842855762262294
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	5.941760076351398
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	10.774696419237818
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	9.043979591309181
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	7.71443279530642
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	8.301533819330155
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	7.45875525451008
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	13.454704639691968
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	9.597328721042741
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	11.735439921901282
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	7.62840659449975
Out on the rampage all night.	10.270004924576048
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	11.875142661070772
Wife ironing his back.	14.174214264022268
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	12.873701006818736
All breadcrumbs they are.	13.31812026903736
About six hundred per cent profit.	11.185535432076316
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	10.634479039380496
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	7.837111819144775
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	9.469975884264588
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	7.97107173862024
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	8.696267355301082
A counterjumper ’ s son.	12.038180229815874
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	7.7528599030192025
Not likely.	20.289026025847733
He ceased.	22.48821851982931
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	9.274456261408766
Noisy selfwilled man.	15.06316360559042
Full of his son.	18.54020881837921
He is right.	17.120931434961008
Something to hand on.	17.848023008821134
If little Rudy had lived.	12.977729516230657
See him grow up.	13.558654631434406
Hear his voice in the house.	16.025881896092205
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	10.805201700816282
My son.	23.1553296530999
Me in his eyes.	18.839174972466882
Strange feeling it would be.	16.411852601553214
From me.	23.317977075159916
Just a chance.	17.670607100906853
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	9.38057734359172
And the sergeant grinning up.	10.61688447616037
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	9.33036578031168
Give us a touch, Poldy.	13.253629415749861
God, I ’ m dying for it.	13.864873978488337
How life begins.	17.49641953473739
Got big then.	17.31540581683947
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	8.590062981684934
My son inside her.	15.460515868364354
I could have helped him on in life.	12.466038899568145
I could.	18.460512223431056
Make him independent.	18.109450748400462
Learn German too.	15.323665810238667
— Are we late?	13.611246113481558
Mr Power asked.	14.305751805946807
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	11.56630434114329
Molly.	27.93506674744532
Milly.	36.36718319993017
Same thing watered down.	11.7615300614759
Her tomboy oaths.	15.027952384941493
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	9.15163555658879
Soon be a woman.	18.793029728196565
Mullingar.	34.226276693969254
Dearest Papli.	21.646735057730606
Young student.	17.447519706190963
Yes, yes: a woman too.	15.664434289752743
Life, life.	17.680163604874988
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	9.037886355765593
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	8.623765740407483
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	10.774741335189832
Do you follow me?	12.266246848639652
He closed his left eye.	14.613976158929448
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	8.736980013898409
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	14.86284163267092
Crumbs?	44.632274217224825
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	8.439812185465884
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	6.337618996649166
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	9.12980274089111
What do you think, Martin?	15.364188971578038
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	8.874181109623601
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	12.673195753674152
Glad I took that bath.	13.741695924385295
Feel my feet quite clean.	13.12528284916536
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	8.196465368506885
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	12.869057502651604
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	13.713532936424556
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	12.009525385422572
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	9.257886848077158
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	10.787889542435728
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	10.473184320429448
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	12.233036603315625
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	8.362321605713444
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	10.142304253071904
He said he ’ d try to come.	14.783010207703603
The carriage halted short.	12.957289410786824
— What ’ s wrong?	13.98246496047521
— We ’ re stopped.	12.964813866857645
— Where are we?	15.859266204544982
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	13.760776574379205
— The grand canal, he said.	9.40938346859646
Whooping cough they say it cures.	11.876425496267867
Good job Milly never got it.	11.773386038914616
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	8.86081159392346
Shame really.	24.1325492762141
Only measles.	20.534055874555403

Canvassing for death.	17.323750065967616
Don ’ t miss this chance.	11.691471158299201
Dogs ’ home over there.	13.518917075152755
Thy will be done.	18.63398306013819
We obey them in the grave.	14.58096337304261
A dying scrawl.	15.90228091687623
He took it to heart, pined away.	10.894987671941529
Quiet brute.	24.291871530858607
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	11.613479924375953
A raindrop spat on his hat.	11.065438261208687
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	8.185741067157819
Apart.	44.80800061837366
Curious.	42.32107495181795
Like through a colander.	14.487410666517158
I thought it would.	17.968647032103153
My boots were creaking I remember now.	10.517509729605653
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	10.758142414531
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	8.310428705497467
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	11.317796927315662
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	12.105960563741396
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	7.290307682664278
— We ’ re off again.	11.689163306887776
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	7.053084492604101
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	9.68628101509977
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	12.496725468576717
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	11.833625706331645
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	9.751799951327637
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	10.643171750639445
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	10.25556209740361
And the retrospective arrangement.	12.292298380905493
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	10.535033348530009
Martin Cunningham asked.	12.879891768174636
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	10.496719506767695
Where is it?	16.47487418589592
— In the paper this morning.	12.832217118511338
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	11.375420410220725
That book I must change for her.	12.3568831031735
Later on please.	17.483500729810213
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	6.208551803094234
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	8.38007770438423
no, Sexton, Urbright.	8.456355796668381
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	7.7682194625992755
Thanks to the Little Flower.	15.263044405511257
Sadly missed.	24.51611695723421
To the inexpressible grief of his.	10.328248044820548
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	11.056703924364903
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	11.93050168369824
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	10.123431108936375
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	6.939774601919304
I tore up the envelope?	16.307912919387874
Yes.	14.818606210850463
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	12.915698334377645
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	12.272586299947447
There all right.	17.368018271710003
Dear Henry fled.	16.404257628313783
Before my patience are exhausted.	11.097149064566384
National school.	25.22396896583834
Meade ’ s yard.	16.035835360546024
The hazard.	21.491113247149375
Only two there now.	13.84710754091645
Nodding.	44.80800061837366
Full as a tick.	15.015888318666121
Too much bone in their skulls.	12.121852210206931
The other trotting round with a fare.	11.380142714730058
An hour ago I was passing there.	13.77896772733598
The jarvies raised their hats.	12.506579665088875
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	7.767611890690202
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	8.888690203330585
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	11.267317667590294
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	10.922984966322005
Antient concert rooms.	17.198063439051335
Nothing on there.	17.298547695325983
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	9.077147079830226
Not much grief there.	13.538188571575667
Quarter mourning.	24.25693356336934
People in law perhaps.	13.132144432184552
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	8.81759869271224
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	8.098023438319725
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	12.3874762472411
I said I.	19.420148636859167
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	9.547391393475065
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	11.923734100989655
Big powerful change.	16.66861908338782
Wet bright bills for next week.	11.042716482825915
_Fun on the Bristol_.	14.00292205878064
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	10.919795256588666
Have to stand a drink or two.	12.36709171822328
As broad as it ’ s long.	15.973939503385784
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	12.2354841954464
Her songs.	23.70354888592314
Plasto ’ s.	20.04525056646799
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	7.922714951126505
Who was he?	22.75532734153531
— How do you do?	12.115210387960634
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	9.9096159543184
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	11.151123032825495
Yes, he does.	17.10682732672577
How do you do?	13.596278647170378
— Who?	12.696584449771581
Mr Dedalus asked.	11.693952645412276
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	11.597449020362841
There he is airing his quiff.	10.171662865833595
Just that moment I was thinking.	14.841403952463715
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	11.708271355128282
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	8.042324130768153
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	10.832127668392449
The nails, yes.	14.841098854202347
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	11.848952294495684
Fascination.	44.80800061837366
Worst man in Dublin.	18.05953954715195
That keeps him alive.	12.880964730125388
They sometimes feel what a person is.	11.752735199009196
Instinct.	38.05020538600117
But a type like that.	11.89584332376378
My nails.	24.47141544827266
I am just looking at them: well pared.	11.046675352339335
And after: thinking alone.	11.31222197261822
Body getting a bit softy.	15.100285478164091
I would notice that: from remembering.	12.650772456136549
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	8.846423001270075
But the shape is there.	13.949470023964997
The shape is there still.	14.359974003300303
Shoulders.	44.80800061837366
Hips.	44.80800061837366
Plump.	44.80800061837366
Night of the dance dressing.	13.801032159262892
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	12.067073795567216
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	8.383259234074027
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	12.470352335968773
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	10.646088779563067
I hear great accounts of it.	11.43162499531944
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	11.763820095747242
— Are you going yourself?	11.697255647830616
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	10.523513686241287
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	11.928403837254839
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	10.101264368077327
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	12.17308740872825
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	9.034862052025513
Mary Anderson is up there now.	13.020697262431364
Have you good artists?	15.063409915449784
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	7.717056005202137
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	14.183258317396913
J.	9.522090257552765
C.	14.422967377726438
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	12.009346081715066
The best, in fact.	15.117056050958807
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	11.733706971254865
Last but not least.	17.543583982972308
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	8.375795970897183
Smith O ’ Brien.	17.61156210564159
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	10.163761884049173
Woman.	32.13023768519656
Must be his deathday.	12.997226571985536
For many happy returns.	13.014995434272208
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	7.82484919241499
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	11.352680962965927
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	11.946573796397841
Had his office in Hume street.	9.68136561926156
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	7.804001085343157
Has that silk hat ever since.	12.453071874484213
Relics of old decency.	16.01462665826358
Mourning too.	22.76639465348193
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	7.574867085830009
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	11.844637955124899
Twenty past eleven.	17.200068467859005
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	11.308727492374766
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	7.832520581424663
No: _vorrei e non_.	9.118022819053847
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	10.747921414329285
_Mi trema un poco il_.	8.186049908497024
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	9.968309295345195
A thrush.	17.16732347966152
A throstle.	18.15456329201798
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	10.130054627918865
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	9.287962965073051
Greyish over the ears.	15.988283594725178
_Madame_: smiling.	17.603601833290746
I smiled back.	18.777885721173725
A smile goes a long way.	14.072324905844914
Only politeness perhaps.	15.553395420659593
Nice fellow.	24.483113005055056
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	12.140804933831344
Not pleasant for the wife.	15.205095617191654
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	15.703578996732135
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	9.728891312019275
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	9.971171056574752
What is this she was?	16.033909964304858
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	11.079701749557424
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	8.235582214252076
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	11.290743812582564
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	9.67777306064534
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	7.2479068758461755
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	9.218971822511103
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	7.868535327098537
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	10.355566729864652
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	14.02286791054433
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	10.374725779042283
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	7.759050025763457
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	9.405985766036316
— Yes.	10.03743100058611
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	13.102734998492583
— What is that?	12.47445978417386
Mr Dedalus asked.	11.693952645412276
I didn ’ t hear it.	12.792345033801453
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	10.034623944933001
— What?	11.791741423260737
Mr Dedalus asked.	11.693952645412276
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	9.46728708167182
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	10.395933055488603
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	10.377053527974198
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	9.269314715740256
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	10.62394867088987
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	7.662411325645168
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	10.715096725018327
Is he dead?	18.629340254037874
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	11.150185201264858
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	8.531690355048939
Half the town was there.	14.713421026861731
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	7.737319950758759
But the funny part is.....	9.969911859211718
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	7.851977335863915
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	10.806417905572278
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	12.41418471623945
Like a hero.	18.311720165260315
A silver florin.	16.40789436610247
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	11.697081072519296
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	12.147324816550494
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	10.834975519104685
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	9.36543213142983
Nelson ’ s pillar.	16.132123522469936
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	8.38329552622641
Mr Dedalus sighed.	16.50344740902262
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	10.836599641832642
Many a good one he told himself.	15.212374450867324
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	9.494904982545965
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	11.163761568470834
He ’ s gone from us.	12.006472979045776
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	9.496708261488633
He went very suddenly.	13.611185137213543
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	8.390045209508147
Heart.	38.58142672405988
He tapped his chest sadly.	12.560257925364308
Blazing face: redhot.	14.920529753622159
Too much John Barleycorn.	11.93021787216687
Cure for a red nose.	15.54022402270432
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	10.884380785381508
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	9.416462578168025
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	8.645237085046887
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	11.087508648115508
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	10.32758931308109
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	11.794489283194773
— No suffering, he said.	10.340722037146012
A moment and all is over.	16.304745487031443
Like dying in sleep.	15.367375763929463
No - one spoke.	14.925250041346699
Dead side of the street this.	17.791883604245736
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	6.19376155629596
Why?	18.42545846291693
Some reason.	24.945886469084357
Sun or wind.	17.423027806347754
At night too.	17.511661928532686
Chummies and slaveys.	14.586516791990464
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	9.954977369781725
Foundation stone for Parnell.	14.453829823048252
Breakdown.	49.786713264135244
Heart.	38.58142672405988
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	7.742542657133529
A tiny coffin flashed by.	11.253318249306757
In a hurry to bury.	13.91268631052394
A mourning coach.	16.53033100192193
Unmarried.	44.80800061837366
Black for the married.	17.322767729499127
Piebald for bachelors.	17.42536966113249
Dun for a nun.	20.239240588148522
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	8.523616596076527
A child.	20.595268738684805
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	9.44403838374016
Dwarf ’ s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	8.467310394055367
Burial friendly society pays.	13.481047273239703
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	9.966181686430962
Our.	32.03659594849423
Little.	41.751346492141856
Beggar.	43.051840588071244
Baby.	49.786713264135244
Meant nothing.	22.989938633459246
Mistake of nature.	17.78893382939439
If it ’ s healthy it ’ s from the mother.	12.365884828234709
If not from the man.	14.77259537629323
Better luck next time.	13.458843858044897
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	10.661331451846154
It ’ s well out of it.	12.379113080613115
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	7.979006291344277
Rattle his bones.	14.247389483946089
Over the stones.	14.910423118466062
Only a pauper.	16.28164290996255
Nobody owns.	17.491303592536852
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	9.201351963881713
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	12.505149678644363
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	8.55808055339302
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	10.76871668449608
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	10.816831474947486
We must take a charitable view of it.	10.420740107673284
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	10.591751242201607
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	9.655108887993247
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	12.473148485736719
Looking away now.	17.288105415459416
Sympathetic human man he is.	14.266555887876569
Intelligent.	44.80800061837366
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	15.59366763008453
Always a good word to say.	15.31178172360678
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	11.07765076659731
Refuse christian burial.	16.3007230585768
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	9.029616297422974
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	10.732017799404137
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	9.67590059047299
He looked at me.	13.893513259793012
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	11.303884818346482
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	8.34225204924161
Leading him the life of the damned.	14.431602695820528
Monday morning.	26.20068782608009
Start afresh.	21.389793365873583
Shoulder to the wheel.	16.18411787358862
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	11.767773222453672
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	10.369358071705477
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	7.57009145406002
He looked away from me.	14.33404406935969
He knows.	20.208056394881805
Rattle his bones.	14.247389483946089
That afternoon of the inquest.	12.589475315428702
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	10.716967785687913
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	11.083999647717754
Stuffy it was.	20.728863363596528
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	8.883525683700807
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	8.489689422806094
Boots giving evidence.	16.851064716325904
Thought he was asleep first.	13.566798871368649
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	9.45902902464995
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	12.494711611738497
Verdict: overdose.	15.69199614949139
Death by misadventure.	15.254576595639236
The letter.	22.755964419778877
For my son Leopold.	17.306146644311102
No more pain.	16.77754080130384
Wake no more.	18.86323285586108
Nobody owns.	17.491303592536852
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	7.674933451653305
Over the stones.	14.910423118466062
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	8.971121549549881
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	8.752979796091736
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	10.986498156123018
The Gordon Bennett.	15.034005420638742
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	8.916476057185136
That will be worth seeing, faith.	11.062463212553427
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	7.227029799669909
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	11.459754924529584
Kay ee double ell wy.	8.619748398296492
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	11.240833720000662
He left me on my ownio.	13.871995119406554
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	11.47664765081778
Eccles street.	23.610095549795577
My house down there.	15.061329630775795
Big place.	23.924736530260393
Ward for incurables there.	12.576273567411157
Deadhouse handy underneath.	15.557693944370463
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	13.77232397934638
They look terrible the women.	12.637285979577205
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	10.242908140564907
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	11.180045073793487
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	9.133241148147881
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	9.301941228650938
From one extreme to the other.	13.663933257465084
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	9.736005191940603
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	5.728521258198991
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	7.739664026569859
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	10.118610668941557
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	8.120049532802936
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	13.613852988180954
Tomorrow is killing day.	12.705140997487506
Springers.	44.80800061837366
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	9.314169920869622
For Liverpool probably.	15.788881011065467
Roastbeef for old England.	16.36596425432125
They buy up all the juicy ones.	11.662991105062567
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	8.039243995738378
Comes to a big thing in a year.	15.46715851227729
Dead meat trade.	16.654560285338647
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	7.282098024570759
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	7.087338396244051
The carriage moved on through the drove.	10.815538301358103
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	8.218425289649256
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	9.8723287784406
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	6.820858831477002
Quite right.	17.455650413019644
They ought to.	15.753353807152594
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	8.844606270527906
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	14.940663987417867
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	10.084249009402459
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	11.674425644082797
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	9.878482022979044
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	12.945033013985796
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	9.65318383698931
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	14.223143381024457
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	8.220056900202206
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	9.52236777961666
Gordon Bennett cup.	17.56893280274898
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	10.336252669820654
Bom! Upset.	14.613608709239099
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	12.62523696202833
Burst open.	23.401007307635698
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	8.384368922207521
Red face: grey now.	13.466261601584034
Mouth fallen open.	17.247022167186604
Asking what ’ s up now.	16.59492031505292
Quite right to close it.	14.878801028414593
Looks horrid open.	16.4036106602853
Then the insides decompose quickly.	9.863093531743372
Much better to close up all the orifices.	12.276039058902573
Yes, also.	20.10765296370307
With wax.	24.647004341269135
The sphincter loose.	14.688514823030006
Seal up all.	20.334490320696656
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	11.787369344812703
Dunphy ’ s corner.	18.78968316178616
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	9.290409759759672
A pause by the wayside.	11.691953125897166
Tiptop position for a pub.	13.527237829157794
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	11.748450429482183
Pass round the consolation.	16.260328634308387
But suppose now it did happen.	12.25842843911719
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	8.794008202951717
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	12.898577255569077
Depends on where.	17.473690107814644
The circulation stops.	16.338365830852563
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	9.570501706934664
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	11.66225595541584
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	9.418159924838243
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	8.233143616223002
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	12.313104272884495
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	10.117487082952207
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	7.630769038908857
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	7.712664517785924
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	13.548187615318694
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	5.198905780373057
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	8.460200716610895
Or cycle down.	15.913537611504172
Hire some old crock, safety.	10.083619647628137
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	11.118585461356439
Developing waterways.	21.50892676324382
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	7.097633052695391
Cheaper transit.	22.85014878345074
By easy stages.	14.760018766096772
Houseboats.	44.80800061837366
Camping out.	24.21289629712111
Also hearses.	19.952669977723488
To heaven by water.	15.744991697734019
Perhaps I will without writing.	13.472295962421487
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	9.050354483337024
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	9.411500861722464
With turf from the midland bogs.	9.887759956922698
Salute.	51.72916675838559
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	9.361877801497641
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	8.535911455349966
Near it now.	17.276062183047415
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	9.078810071297175
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	9.297534087568877
— How is that?	13.61507116086841
Martin Cunningham said.	8.707693961679244
Left him weeping, I suppose?	14.484172263790676
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	10.369722014765424
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	8.00743354498391
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	11.492452873122657
Last lap.	20.772368062206095
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	7.4438564910679474
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	10.75251415268492
In white silence: appealing.	12.31582559687902
The best obtainable.	15.836412915483105
Thos.	44.80800061837366
H.	23.181231911338806
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	7.976749941454021
Passed.	44.80800061837366
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	6.842558392582326
After life ’ s journey.	14.292497015625761
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	9.622125346074105
Mr Power pointed.	17.534296910934234
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	8.08049876498314
The last house.	16.712127675026448
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	11.76934615325039
A gruesome case.	16.034046102933694
Seymour Bushe got him off.	16.138235010972398
Murdered his brother.	18.640696902799142
Or so they said.	15.389864335337162
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	9.360270504899603
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	10.076386996839645
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	11.437619163364735
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	7.068198859578591
They looked.	23.593343568570802
Murderer ’ s ground.	13.21966705766524
It passed darkly.	16.449591540758153
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	7.636918618722771
Whole place gone to hell.	14.514112916771072
Wrongfully condemned.	20.487164663877625
Murder.	48.81773021153708
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	11.134391222110693
They love reading about it.	12.481007403241643
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	14.167855660369142
Her clothing consisted of.	12.580749669410801
Recent outrage.	23.174055911093696
Murderer is still at large.	15.005726471297049
Clues.	44.80800061837366
A shoelace.	20.4185500985028
The body to be exhumed.	13.422391475896308
Murder will out.	18.430518282950732
Cramped in this carriage.	16.815048312328106
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	11.581588810896587
Must be careful about women.	12.379327874780614
Catch them once with their pants down.	11.444135606996216
Never forgive you after.	16.009061131932604
Fifteen.	34.61051803906296
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	7.309145708394569
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	9.632430628110667
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	6.4102452993299694
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	8.332405633688406
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	8.70480565239284
He stepped out.	16.274869629281284
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	12.857078371272252
Change that soap now.	13.993017729713356
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	7.006443375028376
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	9.22299679577533
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	9.751220551061143
It ’ s all the same.	11.783958076335665
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	7.247016471567986
Pomp of death.	17.588496471399893
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	6.916353030365672
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	9.327039197217594
Dogbiscuits.	44.80800061837366
Who ate them?	18.272673435859407
Mourners coming out.	19.14424472222064
He followed his companions.	14.82379144195581
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	9.101198422696067
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	10.395014655424783
He handed one to the boy.	14.346805163730137
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	11.205782736578616
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	5.500198852369503
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	10.439679756735686
Coffin now.	22.76427436003776
Got here before us, dead as he is.	13.142280452923265
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	12.069432772675599
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	8.28335775268722
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	11.44983490825038
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	7.550967605349681
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	11.851005501588443
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	13.107478367157393
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	10.027670359825978
Too many in the world.	13.73059393040557
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	12.507318731891377
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	9.017106339425476
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	10.8269803898902
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	9.17213528821588
So much dead weight.	13.515019243270222
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	11.4550165344525
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	11.881298755275887
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	10.430687922555498
Who is that beside them?	15.440371032872347
Ah, the brother - in - law.	10.57148129919394
All walked after.	17.616559607593214
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	9.811720368267693
— What?	11.791741423260737
Mr Power whispered.	14.953162109172947
How so?	22.816313510745378
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	10.158349967287785
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	12.157793152666484
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	14.091763760458365
Anniversary.	44.80800061837366
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	13.509545703380166
First I heard of it.	16.772119350401372
Poisoned himself?	24.83730666217161
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	8.738603661825705
Speaking.	43.60652022518163
— Was he insured?	13.37894665937839
Mr Bloom asked.	11.237967463862901
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	13.740201981659752
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	9.461849013898183
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	10.345650211081002
— How many children did he leave?	11.396350064458193
— Five.	24.550044879677564
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	12.700296396105944
Five young children.	17.299020125058018
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	11.824183419046083
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	13.400063460879664
Has the laugh at him now.	13.970582645530785
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	9.474540728057747
She had outlived him.	12.544206919666646
Lost her husband.	19.7842069987217
More dead for her than for me.	13.081693180880778
One must outlive the other.	11.56472168628953
Wise men say.	17.280789147184482
There are more women than men in the world.	10.24988512943527
Condole with her.	20.799026706783454
Your terrible loss.	16.25891084430875
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	12.579126648878072
For Hindu widows only.	11.44132786684067
She would marry another.	13.712998832107399
Him?	53.20232736081747
No. Yet who knows after.	11.967271668387134
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	13.102176571621921
Drawn on a guncarriage.	14.822132557316985
Victoria and Albert.	18.798110655174032
Frogmore memorial mourning.	14.663879940027018
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	11.383290554377195
Vain in her heart of hearts.	15.108369031266886
All for a shadow.	16.82671665756174
Consort not even a king.	15.865728648961205
Her son was the substance.	15.368196202075469
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	10.724772659936258
It never comes.	16.739452031961132
— How are you, Simon?	14.804097836496688
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	10.549608546578702
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	12.128395387015424
— Never better.	15.858449241242097
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	12.31758905824045
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	8.07392767747988
Same old six and eightpence.	13.557631255728584
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	12.577540776897656
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	10.03768449514502
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	10.119058830148456
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	9.853249456584596
Dick Tivy bald?	17.214619450082257
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	9.635170859573382
A few bob a skull.	11.691960487817749
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	9.343411113192763
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	12.070537396506658
Is that the eldest boy in front?	12.551774800144033
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	12.233725325895534
John Henry Menton is behind.	11.646838871432186
He put down his name for a quid.	14.60419601915801
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	8.96761492526855
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	9.621443336430085
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	12.673550163209384
— How did he lose it?	12.25244522197281
Ned Lambert asked.	12.728111308716791
Liquor, what?	20.470858209786314
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	12.471426726968945
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	12.518504428237634
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	7.79756788514251
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	12.739010294078327
Both unconscious.	21.04094706111007
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	11.984177230682784
All he might have done.	16.71057977097784
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	10.495620121168049
Would he understand?	17.610189759536237
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	10.093577388025897
Which end is his head?	17.377496628518767
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	9.768893663817563
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	7.29327075516021
Always in front of us.	15.987730391064275
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	8.191737116298613
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	10.558254862214305
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	7.562505975209666
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	8.464576358267134
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	10.582549590093253
Who ’ ll read the book?	16.973749310015602
I, said the rook.	12.021040258633574
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	9.886457166132907
Father Coffey.	24.85552001067181
I knew his name was like a coffin.	14.850564190845825
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	9.874405803284644
Bosses the show.	16.830351521678185
Muscular christian.	24.12735438235475
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	8.969682413273267
Thou art Peter.	18.31599694819275
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	9.556078061987884
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	11.505259375487707
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	10.930222614086295
Hhhn: burst sideways.	13.365323038203613
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	5.74131875360618
Requiem mass.	23.22571206494853
Crape weepers.	21.50892676324382
Blackedged notepaper.	22.85014878345074
Your name on the altarlist.	13.634718368920998
Chilly place this.	17.31556497258583
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	10.338431170854133
Eyes of a toad too.	12.303559285678421
What swells him up that way?	15.91205805447797
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	11.53541147847125
Air of the place maybe.	17.710845012672927
Looks full up of bad gas.	13.809388731315456
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	9.616174806765958
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	11.716413913281363
Who was telling me?	15.21661527670208
Mervyn Browne.	23.3898409561541
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	7.558935040864637
Out it rushes: blue.	11.595493628549379
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	13.598320327555816
My kneecap is hurting me.	8.99242283677412
Ow. That ’ s better.	14.888481760281184
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	10.611092371223629
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	12.088900029752871
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	13.172186444248899
As you were before you rested.	13.937461961935817
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	12.057148140046763
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	6.589924618713517
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	12.385455802730764
Up to fifteen or so.	14.097945912783933
After that, of course...	15.529183664719636
Holy water that was, I expect.	16.6449710454996
Shaking sleep out of it.	14.478675760760048
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	9.358706136573579
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	13.694078430281715
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	5.768003963605384
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	10.189368996014396
On Dignam now.	16.70997562437574
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	10.663733513205672
Says that over everybody.	13.464679575752484
Tiresome kind of a job.	18.20203253842277
But he has to say something.	16.72839480153664
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	11.25476800931969
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	8.52403474077639
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	9.111951151286085
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	10.463789551471638
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	8.881917423407662
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	9.051730447796228
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	6.3340278260391365
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	7.0458638022361715
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	11.422331467035962
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	12.628784469807089
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	9.805442018331428
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	11.337790254095308
But his heart is buried in Rome.	10.754931826865985
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	8.382236014298707
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	9.980711329354383
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	11.26850901102123
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	9.367566500920208
Mr Power took his arm.	14.191157834702862
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	13.66376501088437
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	11.896176491834565
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	13.188685774489459
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	6.979066241449771
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	10.67300100276561
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	10.336156675420902
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	10.156662877266474
I suppose we can do so too.	12.987594273894771
We are the last.	15.734372121774229
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	10.470058084962439
They covered their heads.	14.666402966822613
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	10.06988962601978
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	9.009381838910146
Mason, I think: not sure.	15.745800546145123
Beside him again.	16.485609293660534
We are the last.	15.734372121774229
In the same boat.	15.466118896792821
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	15.129945845200133
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	7.845491636705381
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	11.414643385909347
The language of course was another thing.	13.566606137878326
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	8.538503330503616
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	12.331471903127357
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	10.677692076643314
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	8.46754760500206
No touching that.	17.625787144859817
Seat of the affections.	15.177239024511573
Broken heart.	23.268962037458262
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	8.4049651723459
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	10.399459278708532
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	7.601764134914345
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	8.971658429742803
The resurrection and the life.	13.843221303667256
Once you are dead you are dead.	13.59997023822222
That last day idea.	15.524703405815329
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	13.718583919922466
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	9.842689934022767
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	8.382272207902764
Find damn all of himself that morning.	12.783357619979078
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	11.040420950637143
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	10.759167666734571
Troy measure.	27.40093885415884
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	9.8475186021762
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	8.566427568588127
What?	14.626800461768257
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	10.74058276909097
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	15.631347630476721
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	13.535178745880112
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	12.656870392584116
— What?	11.791741423260737
Corny Kelleher said.	12.352942479738685
Mr Kernan assured him.	13.35760012248307
John Henry Menton asked.	12.983860980995933
I know his face.	13.896277971302423
Ned Lambert glanced back.	14.12793005504841
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	12.175766400331476
She ’ s his wife.	15.19030071047866
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	11.296800001250949
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	12.346540606623169
She was a finelooking woman.	12.108875391511354
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	9.316305487906106
And a good armful she was.	11.897359945846707
He looked behind through the others.	12.119199976676311
— What is he?	13.841402229836643
he asked.	10.114487674314143
What does he do?	15.55667316113133
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	12.600575444946381
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	12.085099305566319
Ned Lambert smiled.	17.118951164470005
A traveller for blottingpaper.	13.553171908892747
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	10.553710479920356
She had plenty of game in her then.	10.029206481180395
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	9.975483278014138
He does some canvassing for ads.	10.218112932361645
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	8.82374918252402
The barrow turned into a side lane.	11.74627997322175
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	8.542406622940375
The gravediggers touched their caps.	11.539514487657133
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	12.45511388038894
He never forgets a friend.	11.628300879526169
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	11.194383662330848
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	11.941772006242383
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	9.736872420817582
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	9.759469251973094
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	8.696078821550762
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	11.892929191244765
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	9.452678547279833
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	7.933645955798482
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	7.195818761018557
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	9.66949649787735
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	10.020874244022725
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	9.936714878395122
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	9.327248369936074
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	8.320286400614654
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	10.38306786192266
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	8.903398905268721
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	10.471208619116398
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	7.668974908631585
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	9.205784379339063
— I know, Hynes said.	11.027653936883768
I know that.	16.459514591066
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	8.478920708213371
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	8.007576335203433
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	8.652582143688033
All want to be on good terms with him.	12.797218135203133
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	11.15756732741944
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	9.272411277050432
No passout checks.	13.395138021531329
_Habeas corpus_.	19.669709954004386
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	12.353847939114369
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	7.689905352937405
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	11.950468672414424
Be the better of a shave.	14.659992419433285
Grey sprouting beard.	14.379103797165465
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	9.674417864548934
And temper getting cross.	12.959105999116828
Silver threads among the grey.	13.838345892334878
Fancy being his wife.	17.04591767988776
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	10.107136589972892
Come out and live in the graveyard.	12.958109742128107
Dangle that before her.	16.816135910377028
It might thrill her first.	11.491783826400296
Courting death.	22.743590815172528
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	10.370015209987534
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	8.13909413457968
Will o ’ the wisp.	12.508343583582725
Gas of graves.	14.531001956054144
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	10.283529069768754
Women especially are so touchy.	11.780916726809393
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	12.040278367763339
Have you ever seen a ghost?	15.000942288776859
Well, I have.	18.903098204582324
It was a pitchdark night.	11.132607714856706
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	10.557124568814796
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	9.946689516234198
Learn anything if taken young.	12.429610373504088
You might pick up a young widow here.	11.601400943066416
Men like that.	19.138604072647944
Love among the tombstones.	13.733675991079895
Romeo.	49.786713264135244
Spice of pleasure.	17.428676252640262
In the midst of death we are in life.	10.82065975657388
Both ends meet.	16.616747561204985
Tantalising for the poor dead.	15.921817208042128
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	9.70592892057706
Gnawing their vitals.	16.19109977777339
Desire to grig people.	11.418253987913829
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	16.326864798014274
Eight children he has anyway.	15.670489927058128
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	8.720955278277026
Holy fields.	26.648616117414814
More room if they buried them standing.	10.978873353480086
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	9.708487978417102
Standing?	44.632274217224825
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	9.343317739169409
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	7.381560390835883
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	8.135220696879488
Well, so it is.	17.197132677264687
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	13.056706674180829
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	6.490188998420447
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	8.787534132233631
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	10.025293831506518
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	8.706309053376394
Every man his price.	13.877576182752449
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	6.4934039173709115
A bargain.	23.99215190540782
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	6.004033779501492
With thanks.	23.697694792119645
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	7.170883399255997
Charnelhouses.	44.80800061837366
Dreadful.	43.60652022518163
Turning green and pink decomposing.	11.528699108467785
Rot quick in damp earth.	11.636050727359262
The lean old ones tougher.	11.309276243893189
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	11.396464390053486
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	9.47306029822882
Then dried up.	16.16579664564075
Deathmoths.	44.80800061837366
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	9.408785829274947
Changing about.	25.80780128499486
Live for ever practically.	16.153626752921653
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	10.928909824203433
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	9.619564327492638
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	11.369248862731373
Your head it simply swurls.	10.221418655713489
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	10.935036610102772
He looks cheerful enough over it.	10.08263639146991
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	10.59807680265578
Wonder how he looks at life.	12.66624158208568
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	8.389367148532287
The one about the bulletin.	12.493569351169546
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	11.591515358234561
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	12.556597490790507
Not arrived yet.	14.012420732942468
Peter.	45.56465082008501
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	10.073001914109058
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	7.53612624464651
Keep out the damp.	16.06586419194119
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	9.944365475042849
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	18.31283884399796
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	11.48616378781103
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	11.354448241991093
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	7.202093302624724
Go out of mourning first.	14.669402190489116
Hard to imagine his funeral.	13.02693510672476
Seems a sort of a joke.	16.09937608600741
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	9.678672552026102
Gives you second wind.	13.832808902510271
New lease of life.	13.13672655463304
— How many have you for tomorrow?	13.649013026664562
the caretaker asked.	10.749072573326995
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	9.84087918868288
Half ten and eleven.	16.174552158243994
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	11.888098130253569
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	9.922153562854978
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	8.833969743015162
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	6.708500119492716
Burying him.	25.005495918299932
We come to bury Cæsar.	13.63057099524967
His ides of March or June.	9.414223888462622
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	11.144157541717783
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	10.48665103402217
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	16.161137053616745
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	12.082249170584587
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	10.367763778773792
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	9.706685822594647
Yes, he could.	18.84779160972053
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	10.424173581319112
We all do.	19.254698412568718
Only man buries.	16.67562022834297
No, ants too.	11.428820923394449
First thing strikes anybody.	13.57616363659122
Bury the dead.	17.959385634926857
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	9.58009250016424
Well then Friday buried him.	11.792594177543547
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	10.410326660985655
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	9.728096418830642
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	10.29783008804482
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	11.075160624274828
All gnawed through.	15.857308742020564
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	8.7027326558066
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	10.24398864978605
They ’ re so particular.	12.810350419150042
Lay me in my native earth.	14.891068112937942
Bit of clay from the holy land.	12.575304640809499
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	9.504430607479309
I see what it means.	15.598607819601588
I see.	15.487968460281955
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	11.616648403147295
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	12.84469781146583
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	8.06677836906549
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	11.432176310006206
Twelve.	47.920033669163324
I ’ m thirteen.	12.905666114340299
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	10.36218180300717
Death ’ s number.	15.258957547244211
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	9.915346724409224
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	12.422672003531169
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	11.483185627118347
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	10.365293977242104
Tinge of purple.	18.096773521497294
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	9.689994571953102
Dressy fellow he was once.	14.795877132882751
Used to change three suits in the day.	11.055880907075766
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	9.664416401740494
Hello.	26.156206652584363
It ’ s dyed.	14.648426518866264
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	9.340802460515334
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	7.862033725334359
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	13.04648517815644
Twenty.	44.31987736607068
Pause.	44.80800061837366
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	12.241932438090053
Far away a donkey brayed.	11.001432529293266
Rain.	35.31585665834903
No such ass.	17.023819224292346
Never see a dead one, they say.	12.953561035284016
Shame of death.	18.00267184733044
They hide.	24.74783592261005
Also poor papa went away.	12.518035769287405
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	9.032758501778831
Whisper.	30.418939827149135
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	8.630436531217505
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	9.579614342515127
Wellcut frockcoat.	22.35669612553341
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	12.05056771828418
Well, it is a long rest.	15.926797729818094
Feel no more.	19.190350571045666
It ’ s the moment you feel.	12.53054770177539
Must be damned unpleasant.	13.332360683755189
Can ’ t believe it at first.	15.005483821675439
Mistake must be: someone else.	12.795506093753023
Try the house opposite.	16.36955714973211
Wait, I wanted to.	15.935909629596043
I haven ’ t yet.	14.457645066569023
Then darkened deathchamber.	14.10188326931474
Light they want.	20.983477030327332
Whispering around you.	17.141864774000304
Would you like to see a priest?	18.2188215374056
Then rambling and wandering.	12.82764972172571
Delirium all you hid all your life.	11.110240200265165
His sleep is not natural.	14.971601361131505
Press his lower eyelid.	13.789965513403063
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	8.982787552188086
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	10.00841843720642
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	10.812313933254273
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	14.46096476888869
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	9.882354521071658
Bam! He expires.	14.848972929151795
Gone at last.	20.85855544807832
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	13.544459105139367
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	11.824236971787574
Remember him in your prayers.	16.09034369616919
Even Parnell.	23.892701330537008
Ivy day dying out.	13.639475609551805
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	10.403745980538865
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	10.25299350679136
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	15.096987773577437
Nice change of air.	16.75371296719155
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	8.799324158241676
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	13.514639374622385
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	10.738215566673334
Someone walking over it.	14.772670371053406
Near you.	23.960340156398196
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	9.412036136055532
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	12.533908076062323
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	8.321771103350656
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	12.202312918712106
And if he was alive all the time?	15.657972101210026
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	11.372249239207893
Of course he is dead.	14.309824473104138
Monday he died.	21.2622785713332
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	8.751316729504502
Flag of distress.	14.578180879128338
Three days.	23.11842126950461
Rather long to keep them in summer.	14.151074586705532
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	12.103321139319386
The clay fell softer.	13.246730018509608
Begin to be forgotten.	16.286928656941665
Out of sight, out of mind.	14.631040727408802
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	10.859685954168574
Had enough of it.	16.593137541428934
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	8.872232517844603
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	8.642219661179832
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	9.308026845939382
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	11.988603746460312
Ah, the names.	16.130321738873253
But he knows them all.	14.977272135823837
No: coming to me.	13.780550720706314
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	9.088832587319866
What is your christian name?	13.372422507514484
I ’ m not sure.	11.476485557486399
Leopold.	39.801171655851626
He asked me to.	15.700045183550483
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	12.693632786021006
I know.	14.309451232430849
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	10.008492847019019
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	8.993138865321155
Find out what they imagine they know.	13.000977685353849
He died of a Tuesday.	14.25925710866659
Got the run.	19.434018725672907
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	12.288039518250311
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	16.540048622084008
That was why he asked me to.	14.545710463935906
O well, does no harm.	13.223487734057143
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	11.993884866195083
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	11.623657692023649
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	8.653754945169387
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	11.13437762739893
He looked around.	17.013969098030998
— Macintosh.	20.281102279878485
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	12.060856426367218
Where is he now?	16.075613832487072
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	10.620617222438021
I don ’ t know who he is.	10.795812545256933
Is that his name?	18.638620745148593
He moved away, looking about him.	12.905760901383994
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	10.460433799239055
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	11.479457194884484
What?	14.626800461768257
Where has he disappeared to?	12.338984654621239
Not a sign.	18.41443655444171
Well of all the.	18.67912911120306
Has anybody here seen?	13.768145743140012
Kay ee double ell.	11.260175154649032
Become invisible.	22.97193917730511
Good Lord, what became of him?	14.485744466806825
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	7.531115938053159
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	10.84417887916649
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	11.268368223471192
It rose.	23.647402058200008
Nearly over.	24.12417691326989
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	8.504421522963296
All uncovered again for a few instants.	13.90982480664979
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	8.639956821150005
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	7.978958095177817
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	8.73586267528344
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	7.930029148882856
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	6.9606794285665305
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	8.254611696430933
His navelcord.	23.332887316605696
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	10.25541813487594
Thanks in silence.	16.993725295723237
Sorry, sir: trouble.	14.07845719961742
Headshake.	44.80800061837366
I know that.	16.459514591066
For yourselves just.	16.00819924762775
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	6.773902197120775
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	9.398639856341191
— Let us, Mr Power said.	10.821026800723535
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	11.66365809811439
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	10.761347589750386
That the coffin was filled with stones.	10.183847825156226
That one day he will come again.	13.847383468858016
Hynes shook his head.	15.798560968011836
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	10.900202651763703
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	12.04352141594754
Peace to his ashes.	16.310486912805082
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	5.774579503178155
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	8.930268940596283
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	12.085539304702042
Does anybody really?	17.318809017441662
Plant him and have done with him.	15.206580490723308
Like down a coalshoot.	14.175274384346604
Then lump them together to save time.	11.057356097563652
All souls ’ day.	13.560850517569468
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	15.981541103123817
Ten shillings for the gardener.	13.618526985198226
He keeps it free of weeds.	11.185978082318845
Old man himself.	17.41924721487833
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	9.548190392798704
Near death ’ s door.	15.012361282388827
Who passed away.	17.805358117362896
Who departed this life.	13.952348804516575
As if they did it of their own accord.	14.788201224439343
Got the shove, all of them.	12.303234909445568
Who kicked the bucket.	12.750932874810816
So and So, wheelwright.	11.633627167137872
I travelled for cork lino.	11.011764089264826
I paid five shillings in the pound.	12.291848708953115
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	14.357847354798434
I cooked good Irish stew.	11.346405286611546
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	8.24106408153226
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	9.987998629378245
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	11.680814744739703
The great physician called him home.	11.331231595700126
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	11.07479124107713
Nice country residence.	18.09064648951252
Newly plastered and painted.	12.932852146016812
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	7.986012929605609
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	6.643029074443384
Better value that for the money.	14.729556252362972
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	11.522594709835962
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	8.851709902492505
Expresses nothing.	22.989938633459246
Immortelles.	44.80800061837366
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	7.829162364431679
Like stuffed.	23.495170791730164
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	11.451691399234393
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	10.410592591523045
Dead animal even sadder.	12.256341688792162
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	7.004843457511736
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	11.525830243942185
Heart on his sleeve.	18.627456489146738
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	9.870963410617037
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	12.026604815447403
Seems anything but pleased.	15.433822812245284
Why this infliction?	14.69642337514113
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	8.935601243181488
Apollo that was.	22.30193936592605
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	9.451298224540869
Besides how could you remember everybody?	14.949241776624534
Eyes, walk, voice.	15.473549047956702
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	12.734832274154325
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	10.264650361741921
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	12.852701425040392
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	4.467339118064883
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	11.473529221805501
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	10.755362069649898
For instance who?	17.05808104152479
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	9.824743258565393
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	11.160533540731992
Wait.	16.117996620458218
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	11.861107020881558
Some animal.	25.0030799272744
Wait.	16.117996620458218
There he goes.	16.273487382438887
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	7.781184975014449
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	8.751623316701755
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	7.05631911341748
Good hidingplace for treasure.	11.855094911575009
Who lives there?	18.693239193420506
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	10.089131979051524
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	8.760029164133966
Making his rounds.	17.404390566421224
Tail gone now.	17.217499625413286
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	10.846608899208745
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	11.494395384450836
Ordinary meat for them.	14.333294434260125
A corpse is meat gone bad.	10.058893643456852
Well and what ’ s cheese?	15.420437488738644
Corpse of milk.	18.609932574788576
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	8.263703571463648
Cremation better.	23.528909592513717
Priests dead against it.	14.304770122565792
Devilling for the other firm.	18.35623117244771
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	7.178961752746881
Time of the plague.	14.683253451193458
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	11.621830323769927
Lethal chamber.	23.57414237017151
Ashes to ashes.	15.544460770663193
Or bury at sea.	14.10072503278226
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	10.005282315216494
Eaten by birds.	16.107231173297446
Earth, fire, water.	13.2706439514764
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	14.277266797946083
See your whole life in a flash.	12.659760411980217
But being brought back to life no.	12.765823533920337
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	13.423021686379442
Out of a flying machine.	12.661869135091678
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	8.877917359633688
Underground communication.	21.50892676324382
We learned that from them.	15.701328758306287
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	16.116315536859073
Regular square feed for them.	11.967822005581422
Got wind of Dignam.	16.934552728331816
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	12.621113353958835
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	6.127716781279295
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	8.62528436580239
Back to the world again.	18.810575127286512
Enough of this place.	17.35783881319528
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	13.22247799501261
Poor papa too.	15.552876026889304
The love that kills.	14.819866455672255
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	7.356874330792512
Give you the creeps after a bit.	12.979252565734486
I will appear to you after death.	12.5262105922518
You will see my ghost after death.	10.63056447195
My ghost will haunt you after death.	9.41845818124551
There is another world after death named hell.	11.33695235165525
I do not like that other world she wrote.	12.986996333506443
No more do I.	16.519223720957594
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	12.3801731778417
Feel live warm beings near you.	10.078991576585928
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	10.919343696247568
They are not going to get me this innings.	12.743509129637667
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	9.485584890138423
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	8.736375412162833
Solicitor, I think.	17.9135641296937
I know his face.	13.896277971302423
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	8.55736621056416
Dignam used to be in his office.	17.648777411755653
Convivial evenings.	23.812190079899757
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	7.996100970289689
Heart of gold really.	17.12643954972809
Yes, Menton.	18.63401965887071
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	7.714538186793307
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	10.845084952193712
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	9.325372815968299
Hate at first sight.	16.514292947938586
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	8.185697312664201
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	10.63419472627377
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	12.132821240581245
Carriage probably.	21.905704367307
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	13.87259876689789
They stopped.	22.791362137079368
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	12.486601263172654
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	11.410181494167961
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	9.742338299162665
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	7.394806270628341
He clapped the hat on his head again.	14.016265410501587
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	9.101997538063197
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	10.073922600561712
— Thank you, he said shortly.	13.834235061237264
They walked on towards the gates.	13.281482834807896
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	8.819939312441583
Martin laying down the law.	15.185515203187991
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	8.880929648779139
Oyster eyes.	23.561434799436668
Never mind.	22.561120462350804
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	8.66311271174867
Get the pull over him that way.	11.715913812856883
Thank you.	18.10652994144807
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	4.611451420011633
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	6.002132481204771
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	6.143278694650782
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	5.5600945697181965
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	6.5564026717419495
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	6.061589232719846
— There it is, Red Murray said.	11.209378366603604
Alexander Keyes.	23.71149994026264
— Just cut it out, will you?	12.29060220536519
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	12.149576116170682
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	9.233775002680158
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	7.737900751821232
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	8.059672334580906
Scissors and paste.	15.667778364966788
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	9.726103081946018
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	9.695500697766686
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	13.86939805436035
I ’ ll rub that in.	11.924582269119616
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	6.060237889251798
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	13.81903000358648
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	8.055796485179563
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	7.740662900638436
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	10.693578879920285

Red Murray whispered.	16.67265865581391
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	8.005981078881916

Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	8.678686367352995
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	8.881903070969676
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	10.206896907076352
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	12.36978508708779

In <URL> Co - ome thou lost one, Co - ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	6.270338736449896
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	10.513364482716865
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	8.881285385792257
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	7.7462369549808585
But will he save the circulation?	13.259639591210785
Thumping.	31.06813240985959
Thumping.	31.06813240985959
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	7.129711980600794
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	8.248908404581854

Working away, tearing away.	12.851513711845701
And that old grey rat tearing to get in.	10.768518838595124
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	5.473294094062261

— Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	9.651168815754705
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	11.49705352003911
Long John is backing him, they say.	10.336591149709083
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	9.273921254133352
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	9.701853987636868
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	9.583954640231772
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	14.078773646990006
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	9.626525774930624
— Did you?	15.72195359856021
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	9.68832484859937
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	13.791587067199215
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	11.72613921393784
I ’ ll tap him too.	11.02526949471909
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	8.337727081295201
Three bob I lent him in Meagher ’ s.	9.972737893249548
Three weeks.	24.906435695199537
Third hint.	22.850100374534687
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	6.5023147201570906
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	10.26371955014307
Keyes, you remember?	21.574057640327833
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	8.850901879782182
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	9.058576115901587
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	8.807722674272828
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	10.149069882286192
He wants it changed.	13.842804499049748
Keyes, you see.	17.524901696974826
He wants two keys at the top.	11.912176466024043
Hell of a racket they make.	11.344057720152964
He doesn ’ t hear it.	12.676018796607288
Nannan.	51.72916675838559
Iron nerves.	22.356447473716123
Maybe he understands what I.	13.006014711863914
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	7.877814991603294
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	10.776538524224128
Let him take that in first.	15.096708954624189
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	7.256724942302331
Clank it.	20.045403778764157
Clank it.	20.045403778764157
Miles of it unreeled.	14.899258572802337
What becomes of it after?	15.329489864438571
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	7.308424042939414
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	6.86376104526668
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	8.384726021413861
Two crossed keys here.	13.293153252959748
A circle.	24.1725952472902
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	10.030129926434705
So on.	20.55445675022638
Better not teach him his own business.	13.190324963403507
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	10.520907388546208
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	10.637224178642617
You see?	24.662666113912284
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	16.143368900362297
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	8.051875376436048
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	14.4649430011364
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	9.593102936214787
Innuendo of home rule.	14.983535520423281
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	13.665084786061087
Catches the eye, you see.	16.19792848117477
Can you do that?	19.54657075340359
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	8.421730927386967
Better not.	22.8288203255619
— We can do that, the foreman said.	11.814910535522703
Have you the design?	17.679926184085595
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	11.11076973923795
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	12.285883625048461
He has a house there too.	12.613820446568116
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	10.625674296539248
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	12.587117833646746
Longfelt want.	24.75738148519441
So on.	20.55445675022638
The foreman thought for an instant.	11.680452630525103
— We can do that, he said.	11.065478992871752
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	10.609506493502568
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	11.145181333671049
He began to check it silently.	9.39493620973738
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	7.3230134545893

Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	13.240329854986108
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	11.511706053240399
Thank you.	18.10652994144807
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	11.968278095433098
No. I could have said.	14.704925475269054

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	9.794946124961493
— Monks, sir?	14.597279308815795
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	10.71341101951839
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	12.902141036100183
Time to get out.	18.385239441647958
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	13.215355237685467
— Monks! — Yes, sir.	10.739821253631609

Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	6.879064118727367
Nearing the end of his tether now.	12.465251568798623

Seems to see with his fingers.	15.934070257462604
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	9.864860863151643
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	11.628666318772853
Better phone him up first.	12.98841640995567

Ah, the soap I put there.	13.703675456249199
Lose it out of that pocket.	18.625584225302738
Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	9.143933370931515
What perfume does your wife use?	10.873033170971041

Just to see: before: dressing.	11.053431207683143
No. Here.	16.29991462363979
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	7.923923250889867
Know who that is.	16.82556038598396
What ’ s up?	15.386805165592225
Ned Lambert it is.	14.848346204521128
He entered softly.	17.187993606612583
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	5.969961017027802
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	7.803416990002768
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	5.658201218515975
What about that, Simon?	17.83517650665989
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	10.892151717917388
How ’ s that for high?	15.137656934850105
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	9.696371802070242
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	8.17432432654466
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	9.552168142563204
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	10.425364873985044
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	10.278447878025547
High falutin stuff.	14.601881979998755
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	10.163504647612939
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	13.125412985976954
He has influence they say.	11.952683510186176
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	8.395117687073354

— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	8.216027192149093
— What is it?	10.27386930003328
Mr Bloom asked.	11.237967463862901
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	7.100822144167455
_Our lovely land_.	14.549895199850896
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	6.723723699941916
Mr Bloom said simply.	13.544190568496163
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	10.089673756417673
With an accent on the whose.	11.989066593716009
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	9.653894362993665
— Is it his speech last night?	11.964224138665523
Mr Bloom asked.	11.237967463862901
— But listen to this, he said.	11.253936153973482
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	11.131008422938443
— Excuse me, J.	11.967304711805314
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said, entering.	10.723129006877663
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	11.28058617942415
— I beg yours, he said.	10.192669979100359
— Good day, Jack.	13.139682396395354
— Come in.	14.37565739999802
Come in.	20.265830792116883
— Good day.	12.759257947046288
— How are you, Dedalus?	15.076448168231106
And yourself?	23.942105737503752
J.	9.522090257552765
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy shook his head.	10.28216534480247
SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	8.830466632042542
Decline, poor chap.	16.05218493297776
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	8.93258024332181
Touch and go with him.	15.24686441063881
What ’ s in the wind, I wonder.	14.508669941710883
Money worry.	19.66961619420162
— _Or again if we but climb the serried mountain <URL> — You ’ re looking extra.	8.19901650754098
— Is the editor to be seen?	14.073346178431446
J.	9.522090257552765
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	9.939774058112764
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	9.294367047527604
To be seen and heard.	15.260643176066617
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	9.445033495982932
J.	9.522090257552765
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	8.39019424051398
Practice dwindling.	21.508903979344055
A mighthavebeen.	20.4185500985028
Losing heart.	23.270206417233574
Gambling.	44.80800061837366
Debts of honour.	17.844021233574043
Reaping the whirlwind.	14.546925296100705
Used to get good retainers from D.	9.084527064893253
and T.	10.187217039413008
Fitzgerald.	52.92306722684477
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	11.854204106410888
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	10.328696851803363
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	8.49584730697426
Wellread fellow.	24.013560876856122
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	8.397198906667725
Weathercocks.	44.80800061837366
Hot and cold in the same breath.	15.82773082514557
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	13.549297416993017
One story good till you hear the next.	12.9293003529012
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	10.61707107784931
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	11.53544790859846
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	9.819182221081475
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	8.313257189759724
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	8.144576015864978
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	13.352321010050527
Is he taking anything for it?	15.065001516759937
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	5.181352934342749
He forgot Hamlet.	17.616587095326512
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	13.663047330224176
Life is too short.	17.599037774165037
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	7.022806542659848
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	8.41992617745897
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	6.991504924147876
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	10.22234892070222
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	7.131054608019654
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	9.87165122707607
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	11.625177341867756
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	10.533839261286326
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	8.90178446444951
Hooked that nicely.	15.89251501245128
Entertainments.	49.786713264135244
Open house.	23.575379182522173
Big blowout.	20.177936877822894
Wetherup always said that.	17.92250441877923
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	11.40365889338281
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	6.941586599966528
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	9.899600521079892
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	7.550699738115046
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	8.600535850832719
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	12.9312399842457
I must get a drink after that.	13.684679347903419
— Drink! the editor cried.	11.315896607164733
No drinks served before mass.	11.269874106068384
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	12.939777389295855
Come on, Ned.	17.40402903601733
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	10.92226937710623
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	9.753987970419931
— Will you join us, Myles?	11.76237310630228
Ned Lambert asked.	12.728111308716791
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	6.667423072726301
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	9.93680943867805
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	9.191459326859833
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	11.00658831792934
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	10.702280702090166
Passing out he whispered to J.	11.47620672830962
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	8.374942942330629
Sad case.	24.71899384291222
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	7.8166312784082885
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	8.750039572672003
Long, short and long.	13.037255224508124
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	7.182945757756947
— Bingbang, bangbang.	10.334687528179026
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	9.620155713660738
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	11.858328563266165
I just want to phone about an ad.	10.302735557622766
He went in.	17.66147812514629
— What about that leader this evening?	11.151982708820501
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	10.53535675173978
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	9.653163694683254
Never you fret.	14.486060466859517
Hello, Jack.	18.15161995326307
That ’ s all right.	9.998213734559666
— Good day, Myles, J.	10.62449742189484
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	7.905839371619874
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	9.72160553920259
The telephone whirred inside.	11.431500499892396
— Twentyeight...	14.562818434814428
Double four...	16.246101022146746
Yes.	14.818606210850463
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	8.367494910917259
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	9.688985768789564
he asked.	10.114487674314143
Sceptre with O.	19.248116644011795
Madden up.	23.063132066235976
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	12.193294157944866
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	9.348935252326559
— Hush, Lenehan said.	10.535575365671207
I hear feetstoops.	16.305373014431122
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	8.491802351038112
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	8.500274280699482
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	11.427648525435286
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	10.174600475914005
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	10.323111749888193
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	11.404400923612192
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	9.195811715735545
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	9.650955232676571
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	9.076037840289276
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	8.694705930933981
— Him, sir.	14.301063964264564
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	11.754009052097675
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	10.151752767861737
J.	9.522090257552765
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	6.712882158130686
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	8.435352498167918
Is the boss...?	14.85305537488747
Yes, _Telegraph_...	12.436062962552588
To where?	26.478843513151073
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	9.338649121653539
Aha! I see...	15.963916299199223
Right.	26.286511886983153
I ’ ll catch him.	11.478672690545205
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	7.185800275936114
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	9.137914370807838
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	8.832815927937906
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	10.901913512442498
Are you hurt?	18.47661272139072
I ’ m in a hurry.	11.183344023162128
— Knee, Lenehan said.	10.010451678872279
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	7.243808957404787
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	10.739404967541589
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	11.722863802361024
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	9.387837376468182
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	6.769561661423485
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	9.880655313837678
Want to fix it up.	12.17747343895436
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	11.919069709248477
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	11.447700174458912
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	8.59360660250818
— Begone! he said.	11.172583111111546
The world is before you.	13.513996893130553
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	11.784592985150306
J.	9.522090257552765
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	8.85986870495228
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	9.555042883055455
Look at the young scamps after him.	10.605874905718712
— Show.	21.49025212546052
Where?	20.27410746882259
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	14.681323545513806
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	6.806045041846141
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	10.806431196171193
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	7.727774668869721
Small nines.	21.508881195564953
Steal upon larks.	14.585968651320346
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	6.40232483152815
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	7.818383143576106
— What ’ s that?	10.254129274625361
Myles Crawford said with a start.	14.419425945467388
Where are the other two gone?	15.050931811233365
— Who?	12.696584449771581
the professor said, turning.	11.551186332076124
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	10.111166624297576
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	11.918155568145247
Came over last night.	14.447417681335239
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	9.145700766463069
Where ’ s my hat?	16.746933796183395
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	7.597633899246022
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	10.004378961798746
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	10.602827205427404
— Seems to be, J.	12.858327921878322
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	9.08941153476404
Who has the most matches?	15.867640108172614
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	8.38385232368127
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	9.489146156128772
J.	9.522090257552765
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	9.343429015085185
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	8.971904228838364
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	10.172287601736553
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	6.029300560670133
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	8.286870312352631
— Eh?	17.54159321837913
You bloody old Roman empire?	13.615981733997739
Myles Crawford said.	10.20262890230167
He took a cigarette from the open case.	12.137820443279367
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	8.532854275423277
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said gently.	10.717103326781888
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	7.9628120559751165
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	9.357875286126077
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	8.451984783068923
— That ’ s it, he said.	10.09116021918016
We are the fat.	16.888850684630405
You and I are the fat in the fire.	12.102499150697232
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	9.811490579275407
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	7.533318119994035
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	10.282105948701663
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	7.305801756767923
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	7.041718201720239
Vast, I allow: but vile.	11.917944030466648
Cloacae: sewers.	14.609046625888158
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	7.933073534556144
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	8.947756451117067
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	7.588232419715022
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	9.807257468045481
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	8.53555263798375
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	9.202773090951752
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	9.92852258975417
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy murmured.	12.513695251143536
But we have also Roman law.	11.47285969344282
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	6.96824930290902
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	8.301020343003428
J.	9.522090257552765
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy asked.	10.859959043188601
Everything was going swimmingly...	11.395206905106019
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	9.604860261796851
Are you ready?	19.04006710468005
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	7.512549208006449
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	12.15764356601242
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	7.8067087994318785
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	8.585027912142316
— How do you do?	12.115210387960634
the editor said, holding out a hand.	10.642902125055622
Come in.	20.265830792116883
Your governor is just gone.	11.885084745324681
???	12.073985761664545
Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	9.221889833569113
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	7.260569928521944
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	8.839121703052864
— Who?	12.696584449771581
the editor asked.	10.763289966660032
Bit torn off.	16.859872265688164
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	8.89448957946436
— That old pelters, the editor said.	8.708246666162504
Who tore it?	19.362981778452838
Was he short taken?	14.339924084452987
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	6.752914701914813
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	10.43370784688956
Foot and mouth?	21.811092983081156
Are you turned...?	16.871150014738394
Bullockbefriending bard.	22.12882018319144
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	9.787397362260258
The letter is not mine.	13.968132424431923
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	12.331881228438817
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	13.008744890341175
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	8.104409803301005
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	9.040074176205744
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	10.502829414272156
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	7.9010184379833595
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	8.817921613182564
— Is he a widower?	13.38572132470302
Stephen asked.	15.303264734747627
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	8.811093363375289
Emperor ’ s horses.	15.033816746817104
Habsburg.	44.80800061837366
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	8.619001875158597
Don ’ t you forget! Maximilian Karl O ’ Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	6.176890984081307
Going to be trouble there one day.	11.608989522781453
Wild geese.	20.486947654256923
O yes, every time.	15.575954774988311
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	9.330311594635738
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	8.618874742158226
Saving princes is a thank you job.	10.716855113345776
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	13.488149466983188
— And if not?	16.642051910353544
he said.	10.24588778153892
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	11.18701301937047
A Hungarian it was one day...	13.838552693571296
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	6.413517685470052
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	11.926711357694817
We were never loyal to the successful.	11.827106879937308
We serve them.	16.830976147603298
I teach the blatant Latin language.	10.741914577149384
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	8.132567287142715
Material domination.	19.669699536138168
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	12.182627711848756
Lord Jesus?	28.37333034134864
Lord Salisbury?	22.467321165887334
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	6.414446199803933
— The Greek! he said again.	14.276366478872719
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	7.693625194352187
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	13.22799058636489
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	9.694664732952317
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	8.49872519030176
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	6.466918701850271
They went under.	19.11302719564106
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	6.994403125497805
Loyal to a lost cause.	13.684929524567545
He strode away from them towards the window.	12.518665480457125
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	8.66758250659626
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	9.770914761801597
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	9.893960125549274
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	6.442573221385367
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	8.12087165779559
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	11.541194049566332
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	9.525183992046182
Whose mother is beastly dead.	12.836680986680122
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	9.519046412561268
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	9.94997611106706
I ’ ll read the rest after.	12.289829139273246
That ’ ll be all right.	10.158524163175993
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	14.618558548295981
— But my riddle! he said.	10.38248880777109
What opera is like a railwayline?	12.118262109533703
— Opera?	23.114410966387492
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	7.589541048950536
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	9.52587824937965
See the wheeze?	18.03528955392717
Rows of cast steel.	12.771873923867876
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	8.820404421283387
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	8.05053694987616
— Help! he sighed.	12.190185958532274
I feel a strong weakness.	13.31651459228969
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	7.901799333077658
— Paris, past and present, he said.	11.09709593399312
You look like communards.	13.803503674784181
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	7.973625349272459
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	10.00333825621743
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	8.851269249509746
You look as though you had done the deed.	11.284896032366703
General Bobrikoff.	20.75004433473241
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	10.408562629806033
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	7.492067268598149
Law, the classics...	12.486907139240945
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	12.13443785842492
— Literature, the press.	12.001986965096746
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	9.639076357792453
The gentle art of advertisement.	13.11536413134991
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	10.242404236271001
The vocal muse.	14.626659071596855
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	15.036052544319325
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	14.968597514563907
— Ahem! he said very softly.	13.149622140367628
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	10.635516004755097
The gate was open.	13.945965697364278
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	6.935353936733644
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	11.731640801202705
Something with a bite in it.	12.954938379756266
You can do it.	15.462474981609143
I see it in your face.	14.851113782117997
_In the lexicon of youth_...	8.103114431554042
See it in your face.	14.287521989753754
See it in your eye.	15.159186275288521
Lazy idle little schemer.	9.904732318789614
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	8.150654378386275
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	8.375732324009482
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	7.862804356532069
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	11.558479281195064
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	7.940946829412751
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	6.823398711321481
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	11.216990616496371
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	8.943719500436014
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said.	8.650999131034373
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	8.894936892186317
Wait a minute.	16.62634283617722
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	7.895052470210358
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	16.093218102098657
That was a pen.	16.78863180362021
You know how he made his mark?	14.924323370094516
I ’ ll tell you.	9.783327087299405
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	8.157623134565265
I ’ ll show you.	11.538087667165748
He pushed past them to the files.	13.916526970089866
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	8.213636145309447
Remember that time?	21.478137011384437
Professor MacHugh nodded.	16.13065841386801
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	7.430393514655814
Where it took place.	14.917083231029457
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	11.275869204439205
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	12.711623627468684
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	8.67899790320442
Whole route, see?	14.667351432924622
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	7.901971850751754
Fitzharris.	51.72916675838559
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	9.797378590422845
Holohan told me.	18.81230930189259
You know Holohan?	17.26034030401228
— Hop and carry one, is it?	11.13750300794653
Myles Crawford said.	10.20262890230167
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	10.376443686258177
A night watchman.	16.22023277740282
Stephen turned in surprise.	15.770388473494931
— Gumley?	24.36703429066821
he said.	10.24588778153892
You don ’ t say so?	14.959496484475988
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	9.722202816750906
Look at here.	14.689176367951523
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	11.71000649910715
I ’ ll tell you.	9.783327087299405
Inspiration of genius.	17.38518426091407
Cabled right away.	16.7854187026237
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	9.238508638264864
Right.	26.286511886983153
Have you got that?	14.529589805197036
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	9.108408702691358
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	7.582930647177194
Have you got that?	14.529589805197036
Right.	26.286511886983153
The telephone whirred.	14.359357593983946
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	12.959659779004214
— B is parkgate.	12.557247774288935
Good.	25.732617673280004
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	7.450319230438401
— T is viceregal lodge.	10.836835216113654
C is where murder took place.	11.841676460744155
K is Knockmaroon gate.	11.821376634857206
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	10.095416205238013
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	8.453560527067456
— Hello?	18.68404111415988
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	13.70007328213637
Hello?...	14.703362330362067

Yes...	13.206010816745593
Yes.	14.818606210850463
— F to P is the route Skin - the - Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	5.680871073500981
<URL>. Got that?	15.967587579814742
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	8.03273030639625
The professor came to the inner door.	13.06584740754187
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	10.127009395497744
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	11.984514987696356
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	9.504934322812572
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	7.520005364122149
Very.	40.8371634248276
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	10.445874037994457
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	13.344627767818034
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	12.695329355117947
I was present.	18.88135766983295
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	8.745079565986144
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	10.86893883114715
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	9.21751209575492
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	10.38644995027508
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	10.27528955242221
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	8.576212975168549
Out of an advertisement.	17.94791668944724
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	11.578062821038905
That gave him the leg up.	15.181010407609895
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <URL> Now he ’ s got in with Blumenfeld.	9.68732110020558
That ’ s press.	14.503389192901448
That ’ s talent.	13.38171540512003
Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	8.809841973728886
— Hello?...	10.539869991212583
Are you there?...	13.635334128390927
Yes, he ’ s here still.	14.616386573152166
Come across yourself.	17.125295276280493
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	9.859261378664202
the editor cried.	9.127249991176768
He flung the pages down.	12.915443628092058
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	9.515551112880319
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	8.73541823968288
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	11.521051809371302
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	10.177205375861346
— O yes, J.	12.539146886165787
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	10.082374892123363
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	8.864914219982367
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin - the - Goat.	7.639054968776959
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! — They ’ re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	7.695110299695041
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	8.653191391655517
Eh?	23.58146863325907
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	9.657095838082766
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	6.160611968608489
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	10.46134541240625
Why did you write it then?	14.331796210172108
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	9.222177600581391
Is the mouth south someway?	14.165949573543216
Or the south a mouth?	13.146929259961015
Must be some.	18.300031072600717
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	8.913217051567118

O ’ Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	8.520774402940773
— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	9.689040503598534
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	7.20552039216495
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	7.122179367908763
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly ’ s Budget_, _Pue ’ s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	5.701494804398809

O ’ Molloy said, Bushe <URL>., for example.	10.812042610440159
— Bushe?	24.70805605657127
the editor said.	8.224198584004345
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	12.810199969507428
He has a strain of it in his blood.	14.263695334017164
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	12.194920368798222

O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	9.273056690280264
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	9.786649161287466
Bushe defended him.	16.591882284511755
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	10.191240391768838

Or the other story, beast with two backs?	10.64570165090167
— What was that?	15.599010075777773
the professor asked.	10.089229279025393
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	7.733601376015625
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	6.375079368025193
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	7.971177623186415

False lull.	21.389793365873583
Something quite ordinary.	16.894788448049923
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	9.46399743772043
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	7.913002858229602
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	8.967031833718947
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	6.487714648389229
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	10.647365704420006

Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	8.734970756532842

A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	6.915833917230646
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	11.619362994142937
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	7.890670680035834
E.	17.819059343782875
the mastermystic?	10.886698444879613
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	12.160602697705402
A.	12.93983968749198
E.	17.819059343782875
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	8.475593310164445
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	13.329945271309775
E. ’ s leg.	14.532789231514375
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	9.987975899157755
Speaking about me.	18.80688935983813
What did he say?	14.492833182235326
What did he say?	14.492833182235326
What did he say about me?	13.544414205927017
Don ’ t ask.	15.830729894593375
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	8.470608592572928
Wait a moment.	14.854743750037965
Let me say one thing.	13.48995049674029
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	7.701578466863789
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	7.100056216321718
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	10.732685243977988
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	10.760159472102803
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	7.998993141281181
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	8.68139606809049
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	10.755526120233096
Go on.	21.7199948705138
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	6.733306935426672
It was then a new movement.	14.657796874831616
We were weak, therefore worthless.	9.68481183066021
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	7.228242445032567
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	8.115000678113718
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	10.246553166373111
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	9.681887475932822
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	7.788922798910368
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	8.624469550158624
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	9.243919622841474
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	10.509701467372196
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	7.687409141818337
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	9.305229791793822
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	12.78103089755931
He raised his head firmly.	13.329334872108756
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	9.947868879256832
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	7.262129353909795
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	7.708063693957058
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	7.9948602517372365
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	8.671042297523064
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	12.760504068138076
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	9.010401174626523
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	6.924927612376638
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	12.370320479290953
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	8.552405252918225
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	8.268033027291533
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	5.444543268561857
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	7.308027737787333
Child, man, effigy.	16.38408707588517
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	5.442584087120588
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	4.894054561352061
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	8.295228031089298
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	6.768177105327794
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	8.04109884763178
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	7.532685112165548
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	7.997909600853698
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	8.408784535203248
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	5.338481515693562
And with a great future behind him.	11.833154703061423
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	7.022088259973139
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	10.219723769823739
Gone with the wind.	17.878145785787506
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	8.366096047877349
Miles of ears of porches.	11.042441984354477
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	9.253218414127597
A people sheltered within his voice.	11.236842377899118
Dead noise.	24.203705718765338
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	10.179695217715901
Love and laud him: me no more.	10.488346947446058
I have money.	18.429874924952127
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	11.143513979423222
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	7.60571613043325
— You take my breath away.	12.096387480062527
It is not perchance a French compliment?	10.513535388436669
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	10.455242610115238
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	6.14533566874031
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	8.442702442279971
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	11.191678299161326
The contrary no.	16.995540388915778
I declare it carried.	13.469055436488368
To which particular boosing shed...?	10.410358463616483
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	7.9629624605519895
Yes, we will not.	17.536921662929558
By no manner of means.	13.579125391473521
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	7.311233729736561
Let us go.	18.063554970561636
Where are those blasted keys?	12.412386172770738
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	9.687402349560672
— Foot and mouth.	12.678098074480031
I know.	14.309451232430849
That ’ ll be all right.	10.158524163175993
That ’ ll go in.	15.01812154640912
Where are they?	19.00145010571692
That ’ s all right.	9.998213734559666
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	10.88648925161587
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	11.813380662047926
Myles, one moment.	17.914818965795742
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	10.169995886671613
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	11.08067573837225
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	10.484283709774123
It has the prophetic vision.	11.908551414803549
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	9.72446680320355
Kingdoms of this world.	17.40786466200235
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	8.046669961305959
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	7.758742098133129
I have much, much to learn.	13.82653997877281
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	12.48991963572965
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	10.389794150812849
— Yes?	16.576671962240066
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	9.937576432336217
Crawford will follow.	17.052564739234025
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	6.672288963390617
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	7.021283766703
— Where is that?	15.419406109519224
the professor asked.	10.089229279025393
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	9.315484687531418
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	8.448508667914464
Against the wall.	18.0628611466909
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	8.305144697903694
Frantic hearts.	22.97193917730511
Akasic records.	19.46619032892918
Quicker, darlint! On now.	9.93295092584983
Dare it.	23.83813679680877
Let there be life.	14.654169464722976
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	10.130385552296497
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	8.017113390235668
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	6.848099424547365
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	10.849188053346337
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	8.46562038602396
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	9.08883329262923
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	5.297182075308763
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	8.356897247833352
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	7.224728883169938
Glory be to God.	16.184264407194366
They had no idea it was that high.	13.876342151573247
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	7.599467188582026
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	7.496836183097328
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	8.169005511405647
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	11.437586363107911
Vestal virgins.	22.18984628924021
I can see them.	16.766961109816368
What ’ s keeping our friend?	12.438894035707536
He turned.	16.264341045904594
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	7.109849919028893
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	8.753387138860038
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy.	12.587809059951704
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	10.688945315743139
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	12.973775268652687
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	10.794073956485423
I see them.	18.037973425731202
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	6.692722700114596

A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	7.699216879760954
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	11.55575021957003
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	10.447762357365068
After he ’ ll see.	19.299061753835133
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	8.880807281024218
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	9.233671033605152
I can have access to it in the national library.	11.580735494533997
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	12.52664286448833
His name is Keyes.	15.962738101741254
It ’ s a play on the name.	11.911769694697208
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	10.451409271094416
But he wants just a little puff.	13.116621375692853
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	17.738917230236638
<URL>. — Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	12.343176859718673
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	10.123164158907375
Tell him that straight from the stable.	11.365767060772137
Look out for squalls.	14.92403966417509
All off for a drink.	16.38417597566922

Usual blarney.	21.508903979344055
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	11.537762381431572
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	14.179162712105526
Been walking in muck somewhere.	11.158844173220393
What was he doing in Irishtown?	13.688729258898759
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	11.488742294881343
He ’ d give the ad, I think.	11.622664090233672
I ’ ll tell him...	10.571321997519291
<URL>. — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	8.853159153388274
Any time he likes, tell him.	12.788035252250351
RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	9.760208679246302
I ’ m up to here.	11.318954507046554
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	9.120537049587455
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	11.131817706250077
Sorry, Jack.	19.222605008256508
You must take the will for the deed.	12.396913195883243

O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	10.60862556612779
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	12.329495112658075
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	8.016644483976744
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	11.873063077442858
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	9.074190856575227

Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	9.995757402506374
Two old trickies, what?	12.43473081345156
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	9.828980329747413
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	5.964706841824347
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	5.731406001902495
No poetic licence.	15.042533525451276
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	9.808413703026284
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	8.849049327888487
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	10.246522888048633
I like that.	17.280852337438372
I see the idea.	15.496387993386339
I see what you mean.	16.779592049257122
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	7.305211979067318
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	7.848743055031576
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	9.98785157399795
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	8.164967128524717

So long as they do no worse.	14.42950121749569
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	12.002269938960216
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	8.254873099501788
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	8.25373552110452
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	11.090884437658634
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	8.831587001551647
Poor Penelope.	22.517522871596153

Call it, let me see.	14.776596234986995
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	7.328269713101069
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	7.0790939062846645
He laughed richly.	16.29954609355465

He wouldn ’ t surely?	14.845506942842837
No, no.	14.90202603781987
Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes.	10.24496301365455
Think no more about that.	17.321736269144335
After one.	24.77416120876498
Timeball on the ballastoffice is down.	12.028001854835532
Dunsink time.	25.04944333996013
Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball ’ s.	10.336824401263708
Parallax.	47.12018689325502
I never exactly understood.	14.480698860897771
There ’ s a priest.	15.569941959683735
Par it ’ s Greek: parallel, parallax.	10.17926125743324
Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration.	9.88517570655211
O rocks! Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice.	10.181191956995525
She ’ s right after all.	14.24368471717052
Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.	11.258646780601861
She ’ s not exactly witty.	13.646506736519571
Can be rude too.	13.13211449388988
Blurt out what I was thinking.	16.714762052193127
Still, I don ’ t know.	12.551347250480333
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.	10.100695731476344
He has legs like barrels and you ’ d think he was singing into a barrel.	10.42753123120832
Now, isn ’ t that wit.	13.534680461180129
They used to call him big Ben.	12.900425736885312
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	7.807674536298724
Appetite like an albatross.	13.958259779406216
Get outside of a baron of beef.	10.185772062420362
Barrel of Bass.	16.986423946037895
It all works out.	12.824465346051202
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	6.216737929746286
Bargains.	44.80800061837366
Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	10.68728894225952
He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H.	7.960936236171644
E.	17.819059343782875
L.	21.061707040844677
S.	16.571640904015453
Wisdom Hely ’ s.	12.99270772967584
Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	8.215590062531557
Our staple food.	15.820941383991947
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	9.597243749880706
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	8.45753830779536
Doesn ’ t bring in any business either.	12.423295667525949
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	6.71194197738527
I bet that would have caught on.	12.043025457379175
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	10.472750700807685
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	14.781766933862148
Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing.	10.201759958330113
Women too.	19.313858013174737
Curiosity.	44.19093781523242
Pillar of salt.	19.218490481743242
Wouldn ’ t have it of course because he didn ’ t think of it himself first.	11.558754665808245
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid.	8.291954639196861
His ideas for ads like Plumtree ’ s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	7.228625747122124
You can ’ t lick ’ em.	10.89733639899502
What?	14.626800461768257
Our envelopes.	25.55729821610646
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	12.828916346050308
Can ’ t stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser _Kansell, _ sold by Hely ’ s Ltd, <NUM> Dame street.	6.958112328596118
Well out of that ruck I am.	14.826006645836769
Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.	10.121092900027497
Tranquilla convent.	22.81510010993768
That was a nice nun there, really sweet face.	10.792893937688955
Wimple suited her small head.	11.912676247058084
Sister?	34.584020507668754
Sister?	34.584020507668754
I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.	10.099054516543413
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	12.528424493351146
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	10.108637766281527
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	9.793577614773515
Our great day, she said.	12.682585811072924
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.	10.162866087791638
Sweet name too: caramel.	13.579691266245112
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	15.907591736234474
If she had married she would have changed.	12.546206760904498
I suppose they really were short of money.	10.194418224115518
Fried everything in the best butter all the same.	13.17045005820887
No lard for them.	13.886797720303205
My heart ’ s broke eating dripping.	10.222722462809108
They like buttering themselves in and out.	11.33291468920379
Molly tasting it, her veil up.	13.499102932662831
Sister?	34.584020507668754
Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker ’ s daughter.	10.674954779933687
It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.	9.136578891732526
He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by.	7.164854024598536
Rover cycleshop.	19.669709954004386
Those races are on today.	13.166174691329514
How long ago is that?	14.870431078155976
Year Phil Gilligan died.	11.346768104062443
We were in Lombard street west.	10.40156660685146
Wait: was in Thom ’ s.	10.89964020002003
Got the job in Wisdom Hely ’ s year we married.	9.100874254826175
Six years.	24.37937413606502
Ten years ago: ninetyfour he died yes that ’ s right the big fire at Arnott ’ s.	8.24176176301487

Couldn ’ t hear what the band played.	13.77041471139374
Milly was a kiddy then.	12.719971781211132
Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs.	9.92112542073189
Mantailored with selfcovered buttons.	11.188030030319398
She didn ’ t like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf.	7.860022343911702
As if that.	20.257563628571035
Old Goodwin ’ s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	9.570825917817595
Flies ’ picnic too.	12.839492331468302
Never put a dress on her back like it.	12.837786608091843
Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips.	10.434828906758966
Just beginning to plump it out well.	10.966148840603685
Rabbitpie we had that day.	17.744782351653676
People looking after her.	17.071387698760855
Happy.	30.922865660223028
Happier then.	24.02882683961066
Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.	13.06726713613968

Milly ’ s tubbing night.	11.979778395391154
American soap I bought: elderflower.	11.868362574133966
Cosy smell of her bathwater.	13.767457973448627
Funny she looked soaped all over.	10.82803730192019
Shapely too.	22.76161815854022
Now photography.	22.319826138903274
Poor papa ’ s daguerreotype atelier he told me of.	9.489998204161749
Hereditary taste.	23.762106696825565
He walked along the curbstone.	13.742878537469633
Stream of life.	17.631221021161647
What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed?	9.89108190218819
Weak eyes, woman.	18.50784809958628
Stopped in Citron ’ s saint Kevin ’ s parade.	8.883368504841865
Pen something.	23.990899492474355
Pendennis?	44.699101331895235
My memory is getting.	14.413812986545963
Pen...?	21.562810111201447
Of course it ’ s years ago.	13.133356670527782
Noise of the trams probably.	12.248166545591967
Well, if he couldn ’ t remember the dayfather ’ s name that he sees every day.	11.020517085280181
Bartell d ’ Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	9.947756406490946
Seeing her home after practice.	12.653605612138577
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	11.514794452256643
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	9.043774217424106
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin ’ s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	7.155804460091219
He and I behind.	11.280796300946472
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	11.460914460902092
Lucky it didn ’ t.	12.631640251787623
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	10.829997589600389
Professor Goodwin linking her in front.	11.720998785745236
Shaky on his pins, poor old sot.	11.344271789893375
His farewell concerts.	15.466406590641226
Positively last appearance on any stage.	11.5370377634803
May be for months and may be for never.	11.594237187002063
Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up.	10.078391781599656
Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust.	8.685610947512465
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.	7.82048547961677
She did get flushed in the wind.	11.12409726408165
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	6.667731518383905
And the mulled rum.	11.247809277167425
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	8.458523087992253
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	9.181858081454905
Always warm from her.	15.720689834020588
Always liked to let her self out.	12.864447103357096
Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins.	9.617019079875295
Milly tucked up in beddyhouse.	13.493580673781594
Happy.	30.922865660223028
Happy.	30.922865660223028
That was the night...	14.990587983695098
— O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	12.688730628861405
— O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	14.434404976423544
— No use complaining.	12.368864692435807
How is Molly those times?	12.804628625601051
Haven ’ t seen her for ages.	13.228014656235974
— In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	13.730693827277408
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	12.10352709104889
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	10.411883701502612
— Yes.	10.03743100058611
In a photographer ’ s there.	11.052501211673558
Getting on like a house on fire.	12.53235012175183
How are all your charges?	13.625747420241542
— All on the baker ’ s list, Mrs Breen said.	8.609729525479104
— You ’ re in black, I see.	11.872075102793168
You have no...	14.949243253809724
— No, Mr Bloom said.	8.798071943558138
I have just come from a funeral.	14.44533540900918
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	12.182531612437346
Who ’ s dead, when and what did he die of?	13.199093166590051
Turn up like a bad penny.	16.097502937142266
— O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	11.141907350017076
I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	10.421457977789892
May as well get her sympathy.	13.23300245806088
— Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	11.670611003491787
An old friend of mine.	13.479822869774715
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	11.687498307531502
Heart trouble, I believe.	19.143418811517897
Funeral was this morning.	14.76330466994659
Your funeral ’ s tomorrow While you ’ re coming through the rye.	9.200018635856031
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	10.313886392538125
— Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen ’ s womaneyes said melancholily.	8.004667889183706
Now that ’ s quite enough about that.	13.696039237538583
Just: quietly: husband.	12.072574885738378
— And your lord and master?	12.54908750034679
Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	11.826394473455775
— O, don ’ t be talking! she said.	9.882804870344271
He ’ s a caution to rattlesnakes.	9.374061305638364
He ’ s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	9.693651130059411
He has me heartscalded.	12.668456545407818
Wait till I show you.	12.16556855967198
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison ’ s.	5.6135112134644345
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom ’ s gullet.	10.511901827589375
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they ’ d taste it with the hot tea.	8.442748527722074
Or is it from her?	19.90603813470181
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	7.85825206027191
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	8.59016760500959
Pleasure or pain is it?	12.810577045456942
Penny dinner.	24.071007710082732
Knife and fork chained to the table.	10.729462842380741
Opening her handbag, chipped leather.	9.058311100056596
Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things.	11.153905026722985
Stick it in a chap ’ s eye in the tram.	13.619133572169435
Rummaging.	44.80800061837366
Open.	42.32107495181795

Please take one.	19.108162001660816
Devils if they lose sixpence.	13.853465665746178
Raise Cain.	19.669709954004386
Husband barging.	20.455761874480615
Where ’ s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday?	12.382626945991818
Are you feeding your little brother ’ s family?	11.015557656021743
Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle.	11.836876075032956
Pastille that was fell.	16.75110820146203
What is she?...	12.696175618332765
— There must be a new moon out, she said.	11.196868166183725
He ’ s always bad then.	11.899280795136946
Do you know what he did last night?	13.009560626796967
Her hand ceased to rummage.	11.87942614785855
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	9.246036251869903
— What?	11.791741423260737
Mr Bloom asked.	11.237967463862901
Let her speak.	17.418334297405195
Look straight in her eyes.	15.052271101437368
I believe you.	19.093395129014112
Trust me.	23.47615985906543
— Woke me up in the night, she said.	12.687830280698169
Dream he had, a nightmare.	16.349546846253848
Indiges.	44.80800061837366
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	8.620463702688502
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	8.543436281750127
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	11.35465053129516
— Read that, she said.	12.311169529688996
He got it this morning.	14.415400241903583
— What is it?	10.27386930003328
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	13.568014560628946
U.	20.10413265164004
P.?	23.523404604939348
— U.	20.267612406708732
p: up, she said.	11.355855045735884
Someone taking a rise out of him.	12.887306541681136
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	10.23121000428818
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	11.058570374445836
She took back the card, sighing.	12.877482705607418
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	11.676199631519603
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	9.940914153993083
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	9.020385546516293
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	9.441470713143259
Seen its best days.	13.302830676411533
Wispish hair over her ears.	14.196538119433686
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	7.474884384781837
Shabby genteel.	19.669709954004386
She used to be a tasty dresser.	13.289097956633132
Lines round her mouth.	16.89890117276389
Only a year or so older than Molly.	11.281756157459288
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	12.336296405892426
Cruel.	37.06710308108618
The unfair sex.	13.832780437856337
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	10.229944298197058
Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	9.19420196320875
I ’ m hungry too.	10.753045093840898

Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese.	5.825219351768892
Sips of his wine soothed his palate.	9.774784107093556
Not logwood that.	14.615724538891891

Nicely planed.	19.669709954004386
Like the way it curves there.	13.791494129742055
— I wouldn ’ t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said.	9.831734739692202
It ruined many a man, the same horses.	14.257631733700318

I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.	7.951533554521893
— That so?	13.356811734294967
Davy Byrne said...	11.221766379287347
He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.	9.456645926998124
— I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	8.877719924671016

Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O ’ Gaunt.	9.964348246841466
He put me off it.	14.667505825537951
Ay. He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.	9.420220321928548
— Ay, he said, sighing.	14.643230291802553
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	10.18331020481746
Will I tell him that horse Lenehan?	15.398908187779668
He knows already.	16.80526051897035
Better let him forget.	17.507294860285935

No sound.	19.908853261184188
The sky.	20.55374854729334
Green by Drumleck.	15.82370526805344
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	15.663586357442457
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	7.582656822863287
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	9.356757834517985
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	7.411520374659632
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	10.234403047073496
Yum.	44.80800061837366
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.	11.321490441469972
Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.	7.616315555544992

Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips.	9.740867285091564
Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes.	12.893079385543292
Pebbles fell.	23.506116214440105
She lay still.	17.466882656700232
A goat.	23.19405632889339
No - one.	13.231919638003063
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	8.9113784919594
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	8.389512197684802
Hot I tongued her.	11.977235613283648
She kissed me.	15.042363558589582
All yielding she tossed my hair.	10.267711758009677
Kissed, she kissed me.	14.579558927103683
Me. And me now.	13.698261460194468
Stuck, the flies buzzed.	12.953829641265322
His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.	7.849213559819383
Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty.	10.228415090915668
Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires.	7.905589159676987
Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked goddesses.	9.510998679853122
Aids to digestion.	15.678869879424097
They don ’ t care what man looks.	11.65338564514927
All to see.	16.262120365595162
Never speaking.	23.962199706844665
I mean to say to fellows like Flynn.	10.817288786234409
Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?	7.974812398808824
Mortal! Put you in your proper place.	12.16195753860399
Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial.	6.956778926801381
Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop.	6.7347939758803586
Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian.	9.347238107717553
Immortal lovely.	24.072049453008905
And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.	6.783036352803365
They have no.	18.379419841321727
Never looked.	24.571903278503456
I ’ ll look today.	11.742396734087505
Bend down let something fall see if she.	10.598475502046387
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	10.996788493895156
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	7.189594366577952
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	11.516224022753578
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	12.620867213736956
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	9.94927293946424
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	10.656186213941666
Is he in trouble?	17.14051462616856
— Trouble?	22.208162588570556
Nosey Flynn said.	10.048708128416855
Not that I heard of.	18.548111723626022
Why?	18.42545846291693
— Was he?	15.678588370356819
Nosey Flynn said.	10.048708128416855
So he was, faith.	15.467027255660527
I asked him how was all at home.	13.344779620636098
You ’ re right, by God.	13.567291148184971
So he was.	18.109816934510803
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	8.738758634773275
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	10.4994521697929
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	8.444462077036945
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	9.311157292112538
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	10.535800799274893
Plovers on toast.	16.347092545872865
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	8.70877604109976
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	10.219112448708554
You can make bacon of that.	12.335829273256648
— How so?	16.31450422025592
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	13.701089163782656
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	8.993553836279258
He winked.	23.351173285541204
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	9.492745669270143
— Do you tell me so?	14.11145694237769
Davy Byrne said.	11.082287405937914
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	8.203547084792117
Ancient free and accepted order.	13.12633824762217
He ’ s an excellent brother.	10.963547142990311
Light, life and love, by God.	14.105496453788135
They give him a leg up.	15.356324602455338
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	12.51396169577601
— Is that a fact?	10.989235786507487
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	10.094544926239987
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	13.81348748267575
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	11.059503220738238
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	11.818336127782308
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	9.470412533843621
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	8.905049425798422
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	9.510566622733991
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	9.32534367139199
Decent quiet man he is.	14.478051476404866
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	12.52372717642216
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	9.26530345746551
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	11.140222669753376
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	15.211424479462364
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	12.260419825141607
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	10.484546904843592
Declare to God he does.	16.14307851098714
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	9.324649627233486
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	9.503625366981748
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	9.93418046778107
Give the devil his due.	13.030566773469829
O, Bloom has his good points.	13.863103037982246
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	15.16822162460859
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	7.9231839506086645
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	9.050880272831197
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	9.36163102440455
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	10.352089142739537
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	8.767207635735948
— Day, Mr Byrne.	15.024019198068393
— Day, gentlemen.	14.134886563766452
They paused at the counter.	13.319313744869598
— Who ’ s standing?	13.149929977706194
Paddy Leonard asked.	14.202131139288904
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	8.946579525172124
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	14.07808637167858
Paddy Leonard asked.	14.202131139288904
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	8.227395603809043
— How much?	15.765608867852645
Paddy Leonard cried.	16.65191668330958
Since when, for God ’ sake?	16.106640932814905
What ’ s yours, Tom?	13.293791935307066
— How is the main drainage?	11.319257078515225
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	13.120869668603643
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	9.515416765050233
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	11.515854833768419
he said.	10.24588778153892
— Certainly, sir.	10.719058296804677
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	10.38547033791937
— Lord love a duck, he said.	9.715952640154782
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	7.778214644239781
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	9.697142200789004
A dead snip.	14.798028090045818
— Zinfandel is it?	14.127965534171839
Nosey Flynn asked.	14.855679022565985
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	8.173814088030234
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	10.482254753016012
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	8.523072643365326
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	13.13518028004234
— Is it Zinfandel?	13.093951834778911
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	9.118730860262005
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	8.830528254559233
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	9.377365244452099
Who gave it to you?	20.396114647546536
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	10.147727749846693
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	8.40705509624147
The others turned.	17.528425951398166
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	9.3974468733123
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	11.262486150059972
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	8.61391642343037
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	9.422897446313568
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	9.949439706670077
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	11.768810104298627
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	9.028221290234091
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	6.260999837512809
Surfeit.	44.80800061837366
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	7.48057222836564
First sweet then savoury.	13.448607239680385
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	12.125527865601065
Ruminants.	44.80800061837366
Their upper jaw they move.	11.297844116781805
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	10.53779150725926
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn ’ s mouth.	10.484301488139717
Lean people long mouths.	12.857917657620147
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	9.51259824288425
Course then you ’ d have all the cranks pestering.	12.43742970090891
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M ’ invitasti.	5.746890471554735
Feel better.	22.68334171806683
Burgundy.	43.61016457105117
Good pick me up.	15.701407109256653
Who distilled first?	15.513355046180658
Some chap in the blues.	13.758404093827398
Dutch courage.	24.83216436935507
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	10.07998930957132
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	8.194067163609898
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	6.587032855518803
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	9.634598125815437
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	8.808241281527117
Tonight perhaps.	22.21880186038325
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	7.600696386089989
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	11.89918729430751
That ’ ll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight.	9.393439368312343
Three Hynes owes me.	12.655103042080253
Two eleven.	24.133839024054726
Prescott ’ s dyeworks van over there.	10.906211166182608
If I get Billy Prescott ’ s ad: two fifteen.	9.544812568221491
Five guineas about.	16.83653369183252
On the pig ’ s back.	12.669070962026383
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	10.905296352529147
Today.	33.7025101547714
Not think.	24.21529305685152
Tour the south then.	16.050945766800908
What about English wateringplaces?	12.178324991418446
Brighton, Margate.	18.90815079877796
Piers by moonlight.	18.025164902063374
Her voice floating out.	13.566073110552832
Those lovely seaside girls.	11.159333593760142
Against John Long ’ s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	6.516292775210569
Handy man wants job.	13.918915407610225
Small wages.	19.66968911829955
Will eat anything.	17.85813856643754
Mr Bloom turned at Gray ’ s confectioner ’ s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan ’ s bookstore.	6.541587445206759
_Why I left the church of Rome?	14.635261131684109
Birds ’ <URL> Women run him.	11.387704579030238
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	8.830260787943562
Same bait.	21.894379153425433
No tram in sight.	15.224563629631632
Wants to cross.	18.367461155984316
— Do you want to cross?	11.866930967558712
Mr Bloom asked.	11.237967463862901
The blind stripling did not answer.	11.284375867866952
His wallface frowned weakly.	10.181152598096432
He moved his head uncertainly.	14.041236930920785
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	8.967185072309848
Molesworth street is opposite.	14.217077729221081
Do you want to cross?	13.762364152054095
There ’ s nothing in the way.	13.525991799126073
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	10.508777049711213
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	7.863575110254638
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	11.338584835543541
Horse drooping.	25.44974424682588
Driver in John Long ’ s.	12.264191857465072
Slaking his drouth.	16.847968445477658
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	13.032917905155513
I ’ ll see you across.	12.26906308893644
— Yes, the stripling answered.	7.930617119269114
South Frederick street.	17.627223954514616
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	10.337090012230435
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	7.889416047386662
Say something to him.	18.260665817714678
Better not do the condescending.	12.908521752248346
They mistrust what you tell them.	12.397824044207944
Pass a common remark.	13.078925970463207
— The rain kept off.	11.397768375448955
No answer.	21.755331626154653
Stains on his coat.	18.153570952737386
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	13.992332005972262
Tastes all different for him.	12.353264895261637
Have to be spoonfed first.	11.884490431016234
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	15.227957130289392
Like Milly ’ s was.	15.440554110103124
Sensitive.	44.19093781523242
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	11.743055142682591
Wonder if he has a name.	17.162834116893304
Van.	44.19093781523242
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	8.019705643446873
That ’ s right.	12.248601286602097
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	13.93872717548173
— Thanks, sir.	13.275207982044433
Knows I ’ m a man.	17.775107663904585
Voice.	44.80800061837366
— Right now?	16.618198354688335
First turn to the left.	16.676451459097
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	9.272357585305379
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	7.1078931061729005
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	10.904967927089091
Must have felt it.	15.740109909457662
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	10.293389702562639
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	11.171531585327763
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	12.145638105210246
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	11.167234893474806
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	10.281317952908038
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	13.169430565013519
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	14.926577708083165
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	12.785280913784923
Read with their fingers.	16.707952693693297
Tune pianos.	21.50892676324382
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	11.642726801319306
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	7.4452392760179755
Of course the other senses are more.	11.368276133459238
Embroider.	44.80800061837366
Plait baskets.	21.50892676324382
People ought to help.	17.04348904508654
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	12.700342025567435
Hates sewing.	19.669709954004386
Might take an objection.	14.099386777629917
Dark men they call them.	14.19497323136491
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	9.136584397361235
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	10.67789616088743
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	10.625865927339584
Tastes?	44.565844956426126
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	10.358246320145488
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	11.631079065666372
And with a woman, for instance.	15.33188581854174
More shameless not seeing.	13.307845190701727
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	9.571477256549118
Look at me.	18.022449457214915
I have them all on.	17.07275065372291
Must be strange not to see her.	14.296266635346619
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	13.660329117601139
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	9.492951416826656
His hands on her hair, for instance.	14.694251188694452
Say it was black, for instance.	13.884982888892845
Good.	25.732617673280004
We call it black.	17.898474297050534
Then passing over her white skin.	12.83118163669979
Different feel perhaps.	16.060043667690827
Feeling of white.	21.607960985013452
Postoffice.	43.60652022518163
Fag today.	21.817252479886417
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	10.008068905566136
Accept my little present.	14.673236905162343
Stationer ’ s just here too.	13.514917192251467
Wait.	16.117996620458218
Think over it.	18.315140998172723
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	8.234199197378956
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	11.23190824301044
Downy hair there too.	15.023899945178893
Not smooth enough.	16.81590223243189
The belly is the smoothest.	14.022967818609612
No - one about.	14.801972922234933
There he goes into Frederick street.	10.788021703238805
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	8.295852677950249
Might be settling my braces.	10.1489507668956
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	8.189684828621171
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	12.401114838645041
Want to try in the dark to see.	14.282218173455034
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	11.446225491476403
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	12.516961680881073
Terrible.	45.634394343290865
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	14.11027486210273
Life a dream for him.	13.52674130629281
Where is the justice being born that way?	11.092821642249808
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	6.665294573473879
Holocaust.	44.80800061837366
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	7.541898079532036
Dear, dear, dear.	16.05795259081888
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	11.0128419094999
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	8.939892438774647
Solemn as Troy.	16.184168384129496
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	9.529617487241472
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	8.772507173979042
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	7.505861898139361
I sentenced him to ten years.	11.616205475745735
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	11.247848355503274
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	11.941287264370796
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	9.550844424011093
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	6.240468935722197
Sends them to the rightabout.	16.687579200726567
The devil on moneylenders.	11.849340541853902
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	11.639760242857266
Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	12.2818473057556
Power those judges have.	13.739328827441565
Crusty old topers in wigs.	10.249821978185642
Bear with a sore paw.	13.214916899777059
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	10.447478453171934
Hello, placard.	15.513312008628791
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	11.961532449907974
Sixteenth.	44.80800061837366
Today it is.	19.5123050269405
In aid of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital.	8.159413407801438
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	9.989737422099882
Yes.	14.818606210850463
Handel.	49.786713264135244
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	13.143808415404564
No use sticking to him like a leech.	12.769678423679014
Wear out my welcome.	12.963557737269477
Sure to know someone on the gate.	12.069804455795527
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	11.280399218773528
First I must.	21.04104857945703
Library.	52.58152020057017
Straw hat in sunlight.	16.706279186318508
Tan shoes.	25.51730258375177
Turnedup trousers.	23.111577609280815
It is.	14.214041752081366
It is.	14.214041752081366
His heart quopped softly.	11.687064922179673
To the right.	18.068880645837186
Museum.	44.192859498998985
Goddesses.	44.80800061837366
He swerved to the right.	14.681081322030689
Is it?	23.59846177905207
Almost certain.	25.889949128223652
Wine in my face.	18.484277327648595
Why did I?	18.924069753503687
Too heady.	19.98956693594679
Yes, it is.	13.934787423365371
The walk.	23.47445268789089
Not see.	23.9020609642044
Get on.	24.595099487259986
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	8.823514976875256
Handsome building.	23.173933174514502
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	11.110719134074404
Not following me?	19.725126276442968
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	14.32041287091697
Light in his eyes.	18.3280073977225
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	10.661098909124124
Quick.	32.272501947498284
Cold statues: quiet there.	12.47303814985503
Safe in a minute.	15.690874218948997
No. Didn ’ t see me.	12.546479480866276
After two.	25.242719485463347
Just at the gate.	16.128522619263478
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	7.586263244519162
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	9.740251390372416
Look for something I.	17.904769302612177
Where did I?	20.08778256216062

— Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare ’ s Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.	7.188568240869283
— All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow.	7.868105900638135

Aristotle was once Plato ’ s schoolboy.	11.393561094229423
— And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.	8.962479105353248
One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	10.063922390990628

Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	10.464688662660045
He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	9.364516230653512
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	6.192215779093356
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	6.777516071852827
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	11.265105331963726
Unsheathe your dagger definitions.	11.135308727696808
Horseness is the whatness of allhorse.	10.40296374237856

Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.	9.317224909288372
— Haines is gone, he said.	11.664765461070115
— Is he?	15.099441473194663

France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer ’ s Phæacians.	7.474285806595593
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	9.642557845322901
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	8.338755866409455
The one about <URL> He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui - même_, don ’ t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	5.732323551031598

His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	8.38053174373229
_Hamlet ou Le Distrait Pièce de Shakespeare_ He repeated to John Eglinton ’ s newgathered frown: — _Pièce de Shakespeare_, don ’ t you know.	5.4919584594382895
It ’ s so French.	13.571759177627174
The French point of view.	13.538194895389323
_Hamlet ou_...	13.170162473464952
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	10.120545788281435
John Eglinton laughed.	17.5679502046986
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	11.401394325022292
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	9.481477032606968
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	8.59243443883273
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	8.4410140163733
Not for nothing was he a butcher ’ s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	7.9218198799716895
Nine lives are taken off for his father ’ s one.	13.202492968061204

The devil and the deep sea.	13.479225348682654
— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	9.419001437322644
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	8.61381226087181
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	7.41205362091048
If thou didst ever...	10.954422695777296
— What is a ghost?	13.03053709671729
Stephen said with tingling energy.	12.658964041343658
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	7.968513841289495
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	6.897154460181248
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning to the world that has forgotten him?	8.918908295055584
Who is King Hamlet?	15.423420808324531
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	9.898675629610592
Lifted.	44.80800061837366

Make them accomplices.	14.70299406027107
— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	7.98339664963233
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	7.184263317902691
The swan of Avon has other thoughts.	7.818995407562762
Composition of place.	18.25934338001972
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	8.158779173194002
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	9.235376717503847
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	8.030852759291417
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	9.32474187875617
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	8.005559101017752
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	8.90273916330025
Art thou there, truepenny?	12.461935997894741
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	10.997479426376973
I mean, we have the plays.	14.668249609302556
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	9.640498348156688
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	7.748958879715449
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	8.49504647424483
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	11.539199336998415
Mr Best ’ s face, appealed to, agreed.	10.910928406040162

John Eglinton ’ s carping voice asked.	9.845298162557562
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	10.564729916029926
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	11.06023396510483
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	9.410794470671624
She saw him into and out of the world.	13.830578104754558
She took his first embraces.	14.371677614792226
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	9.669722912395184

_Liliata <URL> I wept alone.	12.416171726258353
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	9.51511649185474
— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	11.071234464462394
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	11.263911274773074
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	9.646990688968092
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	7.998894066359348
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	6.2672774569811525
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	7.909914931370193
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	7.507186621237377
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	10.934307339341752
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	7.6452244183860305
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	5.851016609044384
Mr Best ’ s quiet voice said forgetfully.	9.611601794026297
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	8.881264213575717
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	5.432480010264537
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	10.354908162895699
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	6.610819838430982

Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.	9.956453352566264
He chose badly?	16.787816009295526
He was chosen, it seems to me.	10.328806655765176
If others have their will Ann hath a way.	9.403951059769998
By cock, she was to blame.	14.923074748350542

The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	5.7904877912329065
And my turn?	18.999729929855512
When?	27.367246722985968
Come! — Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	7.9299667472272475
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	6.946494042491358
Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.	12.23740718331348
A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch.	6.338664340614431

Shall we see you at Moore ’ s tonight?	11.424884184971575
Piper is coming.	20.80624727515174
— Piper! Mr Best piped.	12.956108605826051
Is Piper back?	17.686407168448756
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	6.100937806003862
— I don ’ t know if I can.	12.254422107436023
Thursday.	38.58735493210183
We have our meeting.	15.905029223465732

In quintessential triviality For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.	6.39425191446281
— They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest.	9.165992712084716
Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses.	7.782742850686232
We are all looking forward anxiously.	11.135770641517661
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	7.288252673155236
See this.	25.016275444601767
Remember.	32.432162396480486

I liked Colum ’ s <URL> Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius.	10.25465116036522
Do you think he has genius really?	12.685437654280319
Yeats admired his line: _As in wild earth a Grecian vase_.	6.863232589051226

I hope you ’ ll be able to come tonight.	12.189610793896632
Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	16.37919477776665
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	17.08886827437127
Did you hear Miss Mitchell ’ s joke about Moore and Martyn?	7.295450085489456
That Moore is Martyn ’ s wild oats?	9.572398032790195
Awfully clever, isn ’ t it?	10.258475386233485
Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.	8.370656296562156

— Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	12.168948424814316
— O, yes.	11.55973724354989
If he considers it important it will go in.	9.02820797983355
We have so much correspondence.	14.139552819821974
— I understand, Stephen said.	11.61162852089886

Bring Starkey.	19.669595358993362
Stephen sat down.	20.69338891901481
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	10.077292107744787
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	10.74042522599785
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	8.533319784967794
Alarmed face asks me.	13.801137343035638
Why did he come?	15.707554417774169
Courtesy or an inward light?	14.168363676097542
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	10.663834691333253
— Yes.	10.03743100058611
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	8.576129290846692
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters ’ wives.	7.225781954682453
Fox and geese.	16.433253968677523
And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	5.807222838441417
— Yes.	10.03743100058611
So you think...	15.631840364830492
The door closed behind the outgoer.	10.468693208213043
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	6.713614869110624
A vestal ’ s lamp.	11.937936161812212
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	7.089346144691577
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	7.262266064662956
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	7.332073711933008
And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest.	11.835940046122882
_In painted chambers loaded with <URL> They are still.	8.818871349163631
Once quick in the brains of men.	11.752784790599437
Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	8.553242072433099
— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	10.711427132258049
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	12.069547419984756
Not even so much.	16.882142029144312
Others abide our question.	12.664578428759071
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	13.100088146398162
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	9.133179385823013
Mr Best pleaded.	15.759395978599827
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	10.497276127436727
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	9.55070439564097
His private papers in the original.	12.668123856882723
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	8.937861930165335
Taim in mo shagart_.	11.125900953525848
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	12.81667563415132
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	7.895033037532132
Bear with me.	18.828513046509606
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	5.267544628369991
A basilisk.	22.32113799667934
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	5.944296934037641
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	9.830914441568078
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	7.066770167588998
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	8.246851362072714
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	9.333317035416455
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	9.54193836050698
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	9.146770016285375
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	10.452492313438595
I feel Hamlet quite young.	12.389714590333215
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	8.715265200355686
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	10.424627221909375
He is in my father.	15.26796020242209
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	12.395404537141237
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	9.373987570960903
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	9.655856125679765
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	7.420378598534885
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	9.039747834576053
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	10.677550699364643
Said that.	26.426227707150705
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	7.331425624974956
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	6.670639443023359
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	7.463039849354783
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	12.427085276585286
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	6.703963839467438
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	8.843029649799455
Good Bacon: gone musty.	10.18519567921046
Shakespeare Bacon ’ s wild oats.	11.925010156543134
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	14.396383668023214
Seekers on the great quest.	14.854703240752551
What town, good masters?	16.137457267503468
Mummed in names: A.	12.819456080103938
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n - og_.	9.097865583037224
Booted the twain and staved.	9.489094787877004
How many miles to Dublin?	13.491358454393662
Three score and ten, sir.	11.33192331910399
Will we be there by candlelight?	11.610040129407203
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	10.265543350727839
— Does he?	18.55197304716184
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	7.851705992193657
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	9.413983565592456
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	10.911104390532353
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	7.64376542916615
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	10.680835238215076
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	7.790161242886526
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	11.102798967801627
Do you know what you are talking about?	13.37493722326667
Such an appeal will touch him.	11.060638596076602
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	8.952727869171646
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	7.170877553532634
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	8.651960089643051
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	7.803220662370226
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	9.600451116468475
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	6.780748897144571
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	8.208089899968229
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	7.202987124322355
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	7.51020323592667
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	8.09955265895528
Dost love, Miriam?	15.432055568930991
Dost love thy man?	13.909619555316304
— That may be too, Stephen said.	10.941792206921063
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	10.045933725831174
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	7.246853613088469
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	8.598521833992868
Why?	18.42545846291693
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	7.3965374708593234
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	10.89978915786307
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	9.041646536680735
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	6.987344419896327
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	7.609934031342834
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	8.956012022845675
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	8.166081646696936
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	9.902357672027284
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	7.8580829617227925
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	7.856748630480326
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	7.397986226829623
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	8.845368179274415
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	6.887124080968712
His beaver is up.	13.771227688775276
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	10.294475633555674
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	10.18238681377076
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	11.869753623815857
_Entr ’ acte_.	14.598765547011718
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	7.7490739605177765
My telegram.	23.714624635085173
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	8.048902605025596
he asked of Stephen.	15.114112074247503
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	7.930031697925122
They make him welcome.	15.287617175613763
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	4.296834555564736
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	5.643742232456517
He lifts his hands.	14.63774529654667
Veils fall.	23.238393998048885
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	7.8558434894575315
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	8.932724202620303
A most instructive discussion.	13.173017284381116
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	11.190250274492044
All sides of life should be represented.	12.516335198983018
He smiled on all sides equally.	13.677617963782948
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	10.777152733396784
he said.	10.24588778153892
I seem to know the name.	16.689788641270194
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	8.412177533664183
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	13.527988001596125
The chap that writes like Synge.	10.554458133131401
Mr Best turned to him.	14.716364776922774
— Haines missed you, he said.	10.490953273262434
Did you meet him?	16.196846899077517
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	11.645609789995824

Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	11.281618179462754
— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	10.100064539226887
<URL> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	8.859566500885546
— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	12.918356340425502
the quaker librarian asked.	8.269497799100941
Or Hughie Wills?	13.056706843223308
Mr William Himself.	18.992077714994515
W.	26.858432004718157
H.: who am I?	14.325314979836875
— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	8.159853465042788
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	8.721695724605677
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	8.706862912393026
The light touch.	16.583711082478473
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	9.1017388832984
Tame essence of Wilde.	14.16952503477375
You ’ re darned witty.	11.175588539034939
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy ’ s ducats.	6.629492757997277
How much did I spend?	14.650306995338918
O, a few shillings.	13.941926802159402
For a plump of pressmen.	10.80849241696381
Humour wet and dry.	14.987258054488352

— Do you think it is only a paradox?	11.705688409829616
the quaker librarian was asking.	8.359582550770876
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	9.33021359180246
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	7.811388406865805
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	8.106394457172946
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	10.805686009644601
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	9.71992771179537
— Telegram! he said.	11.627180652190027
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	6.24460605867935

Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	9.748239305141057
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	8.011797378656688
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	7.049319694209935
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	6.850064644473753
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	7.466869511854735
Stephen laughed.	26.025547891835416
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	10.122923231988274
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	10.597097408006238
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	8.383348809156947
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	8.693121926520583
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	12.456763831470004
That was your contribution to literature.	10.425156025384213
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	9.171900641274094
— Murder you! he laughed.	13.154101803654525
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	5.2390914639609845

— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	9.77177312189845
—...	7.713744315454603
in which everyone can find his own.	9.586028788924988
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	6.791139183076374
Yes?	31.41359560432161
What is it?	11.96707899805774
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	10.9823179000707
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	9.809736706828156
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	10.953808929664504
Is the gentleman?...	13.099170061342404
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	8.231719322825525
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	9.051298835692148
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	6.068930384756532
— This gentleman?	17.99764402833042
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	14.52009579397539
Good day, sir.	13.36073521039774
_Kilkenny_...	18.627633969083096
We have certainly...	13.490352323341423
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	9.4891314051057
— All the leading provincial...	10.245971787999716
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, _ <NUM>...	6.634624066741939
Will you please?...	12.494549112755267

This way...	16.726691328672032
Please, sir...	14.755871233468184
The door closed.	16.45304337269906
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	9.777331262232511
He jumped up and snatched the card.	11.908056293270848
— What ’ s his name?	11.330017069172554
Bloom.	18.147734167807787
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	7.877945856768295
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	9.717637463910242
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	8.928884824630693
Every day we must do homage to her.	11.532096917915192
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	12.274365534396335
He knows your old fellow.	11.421574819210703
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	12.35312727204757
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	8.168695569467388
Venus Kallipyge.	22.174148395774097
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	6.942398497939445
— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	10.303004175318813
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	10.261291947473284
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	10.367273268986036
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	6.33379722188927
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	10.16260142868522
His life was rich.	16.06555006786751
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	8.996166310924025
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	4.972071803459146
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	8.814257806399679
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	6.142994295193742
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	6.34495883424095
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	6.469253569222636
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	6.719502707943546
Cours la Reine.	15.470268185303672
_Encore vingt sous.	12.002264853453642
Minette?	44.699101331895235
Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	10.163898425182484
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	7.580448260235325
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	6.897654562170423
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	6.290253543089891
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	8.022478850262319
Do and do.	18.38333568988841
Thing done.	23.55662228465106
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	6.34518033633042
An azured harebell like her veins.	8.988231000892235
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	10.95680749547154
He walks.	24.098120732810052
One life is all.	15.8075471627764
One body.	20.416633897927277
Do. But do.	11.52653441738472
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	8.45388938912848
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	9.361561774635218
— Whom do you suspect?	12.156003996543005
he challenged.	20.50672046414343
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	10.824343535881981
Once spurned twice spurned.	12.880055624242466
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	10.708229413054358
Love that dare not speak its name.	9.701417269171657
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	10.083832939254329
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	9.032832883056766
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	9.65632326711282
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	10.75237591283595
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	8.695975029676482
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	6.462402332460223
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	12.721354702296635
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	9.719651915011285
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	12.840477520871488
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	11.87640657492025
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	8.420270290350244
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	8.092373041924871
O, yes, mention there is.	12.532463783057752
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	8.622109162597681
Explain you then.	19.276876850494393
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	7.136143602530668
He faced their silence.	11.33422479360353
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	11.383830233269418
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	8.02804692190211
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	8.209423597262646
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	7.3967126160995065
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	5.946442893316094
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	7.700069739066848
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	8.06883025591568
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	8.963980296262392
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	7.944005924025087
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	6.222129215448661
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	5.5931114818359395
Let me think.	19.192407562398035
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	5.933727443546347
— Do you mean he died so?	11.469298628634355
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	11.09085672444582
I mean...	13.290141060663858
— He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	10.435034557498096
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	9.94880683040132
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! — What?	11.95005521930566
asked Besteglinton.	20.34820202906136
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	13.346602079140705
The people ’ s William.	13.906381363574067
Dowden, Highfield house...	10.597654022461079
— Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	9.261661581935249
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	9.030453671324137
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those <URL> Lovely! Catamite.	8.51343150206624
— The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	6.849719799453416
Steadfast John replied severe: — The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	9.099506509878694
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	10.301646454867903
Sayest thou so?	17.443033681539262
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	12.15521265717139
— And the sense of property, Stephen said.	9.032756305219689
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	12.239373729515577
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	6.185218295203072
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	5.254864850180344
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	6.423178491971357
How else could Aubrey ’ s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	7.220289514006387
All events brought grist to his mill.	9.36694559686526
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	6.39355045955406
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love ’ s Labour Lost_.	6.7541957223625975
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	6.054551142484378
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter ’ s theory of equivocation.	8.752055962802192
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	5.968218358521525
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’ s.	8.246628022560797
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	4.674835646662592
I think you ’ re getting on very nicely.	11.289636082506352
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	9.572325981451543
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, <URL> — Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	8.330526786851953
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	11.431267837855987
_Sufflaminandus <URL> — He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	9.375992469533783
— A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	12.941108036571341
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	14.901562487676191
_Amplius.	35.564133659099035
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter <URL> — Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	5.392518298088028
— _Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	5.833870872230206

— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	6.738890917941388
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	7.598011087928429

Why did he take them rather than others?	11.672618946361181
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what ’ s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	7.747312504423713
Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.	8.385837981727999
The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	8.279615329920357
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare ’ s reverence, the angel of the world.	8.157762358716013
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney ’ s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?	6.183921493889629
— That was Will ’ s way, John Eglinton defended.	10.434315454846377

He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	6.366472600461584
— Why?	18.219719893590444
Stephen answered himself.	17.79195347425864
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	8.71436877270262
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	5.34605521861532
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	7.172145329418451
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	8.62929103914031
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	7.812614095180265
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	9.728482281137614
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	8.08276472264062
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	9.85185615886682
Age has not withered it.	12.378019665058464
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	11.213372120781647
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	6.787338281024086
He laughed to free his mind from his mind ’ s bondage.	10.496752412539779
Judge Eglinton summed up.	12.183513965765217
— The truth is midway, he affirmed.	9.040700510717295
He is the ghost and the prince.	12.713169979327995
He is all in all.	17.5513633624869
— He is, Stephen said.	11.89440312931823
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	9.87888192695329
All in all.	18.841157994189906
In _Cymbeline, _ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold.	8.223907300419079
He acts and is acted on.	10.539736794250219
Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen.	7.687045753447034
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	6.094450821668706
— Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.	6.912738072269761
O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	8.190808869653182
— And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	7.238095089561923
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?) _ is right.	7.646205769801626
After God Shakespeare has created most.	11.656691948123074
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	7.782072846327136
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	8.555932593081714

The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	7.4105598369042465
_ — Eureka! _ Buck Mulligan cried.	10.203323007482206
_Eureka! _ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton ’ s desk.	7.586023047307075
— May I?	19.308005349439533
he said.	10.24588778153892
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	10.80428270293335

Do you believe your own theory?	13.20690942979563
— No, Stephen said promptly.	13.878322128952876
— Are you going to write it?	12.180583536954785
Mr Best asked.	15.293318649857381
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	9.091992197219644
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	11.61867040687444

— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	11.0431286176782
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	6.6801549563403855
He broke away.	16.781580319576904
— Come, Kinch.	12.445376759857899
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	10.411568013360197
Come, Kinch.	15.7749287400262

Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	8.263849932399422

Life is many days.	14.346960648382002
This will end.	17.15322914656832

_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	8.812474106452601
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	7.833087276668319

Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	6.841450721961654
What have I learned?	15.773825112386477

Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	9.708694461405665
I halt.	26.344441971966827
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	9.444041143164515
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	11.211422036641045
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	8.02812930705619
A laugh tripped over his lips.	11.354450598001746
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	9.466966417423256
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	7.333452822969815
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	12.362829874821731
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	9.01622618966318
One thinks of Homer.	14.731290357898544
He stopped at the stairfoot.	11.40839174809639
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	8.423582209967577
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	8.333999351299784
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	6.358160606867383
But listen.	23.445234707664977
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	4.900850661379828
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	7.999797570068361
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	11.488499069145918
Part.	43.051840588071244
The moment is now.	14.34981661293262
Where then?	25.29003084083402
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	8.486072243530074
Why?	18.42545846291693
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	10.560322867869097
My will: his will that fronts me.	10.245717717921591
Seas between.	24.522970523287302
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	10.640092615780867
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	8.800001099462484
The portico.	20.343936973191635
Here I watched the birds for augury.	10.32093149314658

A creamfruit melon he held to me.	10.215742374847176
In. You will see.	12.41765495184935
— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	8.85286576394939
Did you see his eye?	18.218687680400716
He looked upon you to lust after you.	10.219633121968444
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	11.902997168229534

A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	7.7854526548051135
They followed.	22.93894279127998
Speak on.	26.51357019478226
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	6.853005846273305
No birds.	23.281337189124713
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	6.644905545452689
Cease to strive.	15.595628880620076

Five to three.	17.322193899028548
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	11.984351405979268
What was that boy ’ s name again?	14.560461818731527
Dignam.	28.52766606093321
Yes.	14.818606210850463
_Vere dignum et iustum <URL> Brother Swan was the person to see.	7.20638686606974

Oblige him, if possible.	17.62511350678526
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	7.8071488651933185
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	6.175879888430394
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	6.526113318582909
J.	9.522090257552765
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	10.862086372895662
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	10.509716385212757
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	7.918320761562432
And you, father?	18.82462921899779
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	9.564492196563751
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	10.39336950029318
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	10.136322678716626
Was that so?	20.555454858140656
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	10.453928838245076
And Mr Sheehy himself?	13.149312150752694
Still in London.	16.45778252313887
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	12.75921670817645
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	13.719723314811786
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	9.449525411658545
O, yes: a very great success.	14.27008038584175
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	8.643041356259511
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	11.856491852241257
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	8.654465029382726
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	9.481002672747415
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	7.897044496745024
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	8.107678197464736
A zealous man, however.	13.564648691887566
Really he was.	21.720562142568408
And really did great good in his way.	11.988714358418797
Beyond a doubt.	16.65918844216516
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	15.244589027705622
Of good family too would one think it?	10.687572867451765
Welsh, were they not?	19.02967912876854
O, lest he forget.	13.119230109257664
That letter to father provincial.	12.980349049015688
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	13.084492321674638
The little house.	17.533823956199896
Aha.	36.14131809176049
And were they good boys at school?	11.665672578510272
O.	16.60830871151788
That was very good now.	15.45549191525101
And what was his name?	16.90710733226683
Jack Sohan.	22.320360196277413
And his name?	18.795093935048218
Ger.	49.786713264135244
Gallaher.	51.4632726102284
And the other little man?	15.735491034700722
His name was Brunny Lynam.	11.951693226257905
O, that was a very nice name to have.	15.329262801447628
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	8.552996913964769
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	9.25518085725141
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	10.147948221255067
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	10.923327449345033
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	8.573941514395333
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	8.901777107142715
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	6.625510365207377
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	11.797516689966304
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	7.492403850008487
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	12.49363661207115
A fine carriage she had.	13.447946990792698
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	11.00850027989108
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	10.220315037460882
what should he say?...	10.033583375972285
such a queenly mien.	12.726224717604143
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	8.03623054618223
The reverend T.	13.851287661232297
R.	23.020313355369172
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	13.508560268957414
The incumbent they called him.	12.819087972071461
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	12.221024029531394
But one should be charitable.	13.18030743712954
Invincible ignorance.	22.356731648350408
They acted according to their lights.	11.837929581000614
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	10.285854098735323
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	11.654447768254435
Surely, there ought to be.	14.56326494426199
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	7.661813617040518
All raised untidy caps.	12.5611630670476
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	9.736596225308602
Christian brother boys.	18.238640914833983
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	11.265840184065125
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	11.507278242875758
For aged and virtuous females.	10.7492895011905
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	11.596884849286646
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	10.555241013468248
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	8.843262668497523
And now it was an office or something.	13.093025973131539
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	8.925775772555385
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	6.154492043287633
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	6.86070280116776
In America those things were continually happening.	9.468724600796703
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	13.16323018587975
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	12.448731157072201
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	7.848248980024468
They saluted him and were saluted.	13.35081305289506
Father Conmee passed H.	12.071650443769824
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	6.42209060654789
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	9.39249008907806
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	8.157156404448765
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	6.169049990124125
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	7.511808792478225
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	8.681696661637448
J.	9.522090257552765
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	7.052658546235418
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	7.895175389043423
C.	14.422967377726438
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	7.670188045825509
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	6.531423604916011
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	7.608338746295764
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	6.532268405310497
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	8.479368123303287
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	10.188005338774772
It was a peaceful day.	12.752398707169476
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	8.922888912047
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	14.284199109662556
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	11.06921941305203
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	6.213054077907959
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	10.28805128108691
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	8.249969429712705
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	11.109659464361448
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	8.734917677093671
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	8.68706899862355
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	6.117683918398357
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	7.908441401464612
J.	9.522090257552765
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	7.3431386774054515
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	5.977031525772115
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	8.422226135478617
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	10.126720125935844
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	9.399513189730836
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	7.874226116528569
The Malahide road was quiet.	11.61137853503182
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	10.787758790215348
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	8.267077561396464
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	7.003092331515211
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	10.510267907886263
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	7.157456244607849
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	7.504436393619487
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	6.607566519921086
Who could know the truth?	15.844909999857174
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	6.007607069514403
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	9.49841059583352
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	12.1388722472213
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	8.671579496913296
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	10.551760971575252
He was humane and honoured there.	9.315647415259187
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	7.984279290847993
It was a charming day.	13.69346739518662
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	6.770831411714584
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	7.966385746253541
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	14.480347644818066
A just and homely word.	11.321388659966294
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	6.935698175958749
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	7.046685571247804
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	9.499711174389931
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	8.523818653946119
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	8.73602750143404
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	11.552089595283856
Nones.	44.80800061837366
He should have read that before lunch.	12.271479415573335
But lady Maxwell had come.	12.305418369610036
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	7.031428065976236
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	5.838447984726017
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	7.263989542719298
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	8.542357734202872
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	5.0840092667799786
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	7.797098383728948
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	9.519406824994451
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	7.737912238725575
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	8.116371284422176
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	7.332278197504751
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	11.615585391913372
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	12.059925571216114
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	9.050123265360675
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	10.345562482901961
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	6.807135177322191
— What ’ s the best news?	10.81476532693258
he asked.	10.114487674314143
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	8.554710417557905
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	7.626026255876623
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	6.886200814562384
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	8.334301795525327
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	8.588292789013186
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	7.030417157442326
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	7.439070244741953
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	6.766424664522608
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	6.713093205673321
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	11.821789943959146
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	7.414881669581937
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	10.427809664281988
It fell on the path.	13.576663135737004
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	9.606678901794192
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	8.381453845562175
— Did you put in the books?	13.143147394951072
Boody asked.	20.27124574629384
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	6.28773682944946
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	11.838194564736233
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	7.210863170787838
— Where did you try?	16.8743513601384
Boody asked.	20.27124574629384
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	11.56181724364431
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	9.86949971748885
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	9.175250517911962
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	10.672342081718888
— What ’ s in the pot?	12.937498971493966
she asked.	16.272589937368405
— Shirts, Maggy said.	9.01214905884025
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	10.852869038591065
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	10.844166384825366
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	9.476970193098582
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	9.01214905884025
Katey asked.	24.14769204911432
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	8.869999225312444
The lacquey rang his bell.	10.060865111254115
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	9.46777183964469
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	9.669572653586433
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	9.155273748139253
Where ’ s Dilly?	15.986633289307466
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	9.70131177930963
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	8.942438859365252
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	5.80456521815471
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	5.8864580405237525
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	8.369267926265458
— Put these in first, will you?	10.831029158544652
he said.	10.24588778153892
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	9.314274289531191
And the fruit on top.	12.996119142035065
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	8.549383840007389
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	7.197502095314961
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	6.525852841879461
H.	23.181231911338806
E.	17.819059343782875
L.	21.061707040844677
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	7.294662350532002
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	7.920495203898293
— Can you send them by tram?	12.391254854579346
Now?	35.95266239213238
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	6.234089237175286
— Certainly, sir.	10.719058296804677
Is it in the city?	21.64885997171693
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	10.528266725796376
Ten minutes.	25.038097883994773
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	9.479718885451671
— Will you write the address, sir?	11.257711239745808
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	9.006793399897537
— Send it at once, will you?	12.35812752577229
he said.	10.24588778153892
It ’ s for an invalid.	11.802524990197849
— Yes, sir.	7.6724029537384775
I will, sir.	13.4562266471606
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	9.834907899147643
— What ’ s the damage?	11.863035689608488
he asked.	10.114487674314143
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	8.485893908038062
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	11.961339119544114
A young pullet.	14.79077647226773
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	9.21431847199313
he asked gallantly.	14.754816841635753
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	8.741562724335257
— Yes, sir, she said.	8.828755347961103
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	7.0162969761870935
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	8.461920991892791
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	10.924276616866408
he asked roguishly.	13.736889308462981
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	7.581381529274753
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	8.096229038694249
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	6.538837365184255
Palefaces.	44.19093781523242
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	9.113962743249926
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	7.729508212330508
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	4.113740461676087
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	4.63242199436551
È peccato.	19.669709954004386
Perchè la sua voce...	8.46182860796639
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	6.561845045384917
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	8.48160641926013
_Ma, dia retta a me.	8.59788528740463
Ci rifletta_.	19.669709954004386
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	6.110047607157068
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	9.517141818771998
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	6.532305998050512
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	10.698092239103083
Human eyes.	23.553758928401496
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	8.605253408375557
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	8.629529883008678
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	7.810765784077783
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	9.594428119446562
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	7.358660045122316
_Scusi, eh?	15.38048730055059
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	5.052969515629048
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	5.9956140081530185
Too much mystery business in it.	10.761631558623174
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	15.452726981395882
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	9.310426622807821
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	6.487572113588941
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	9.421888847288336
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny ’ s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone ’ s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	6.29559743891084
E.	17.819059343782875
L.	21.061707040844677
Y. ’ S and plodded back as they had come.	10.845127812210055
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	5.777433444498087
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	13.157068542151782
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	12.636931950946162
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	12.375661917262038
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	11.907757155466912
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	7.481105769857351
They kick out grand.	13.62129325123295
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	10.846909424410434
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	10.607181241195336
— Hello.	14.770413032095936
Yes, sir.	9.980117867118919
No, sir.	12.165774184559005
Yes, sir.	9.980117867118919
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	9.788965771928131
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	13.124391709612697
All right, sir.	14.624268822667377
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	11.762831647998645
A quarter after.	18.458206612970052
Yes, sir.	9.980117867118919
Twentyseven and six.	17.15289667676098
I ’ ll tell him.	10.62502952981945
Yes: one, seven, six.	14.277167710304944
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	10.36492520598365
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	8.14101937537547
Mr Lenehan, yes.	17.76934642337711
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	13.710118901707776
No, sir.	12.165774184559005
Yes, sir.	9.980117867118919
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	9.788965771928131
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	7.356104586025463
— Who ’ s that?	12.594638725146751
Ned Lambert asked.	12.728111308716791
Is that Crotty?	15.6069665487625
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	8.181755848160165
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	11.56302853475852
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	7.2305868399232285
Come on.	18.31575871878564
Mind your steps there.	14.731288497978614
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	7.950828283806055
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	7.470643217899397
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	8.69482511514469
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	9.469312175602246
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	7.137742043672541
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	11.451429926064344
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	7.915473415009243
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	13.40357789286496
— No, Ned.	13.866493933370235
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	7.561759823072438
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	9.364924113571297
That ’ s quite right, sir.	11.649852764099963
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	10.49400220380965
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	9.169582252117824
Bring the camera whenever you like.	10.518677638569617
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	9.5485393074694
You can take it from here or from here.	12.581592752049541
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	6.660805115588685
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	9.771301609584633
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	8.806354946849806
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	10.143870960043039
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	9.274453143765587
Drop in whenever you like.	12.793201769467808
Next week, say.	15.37966633051946
Can you see?	20.8355037131131
— Yes, yes.	10.319329343686517
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	15.540071662248108
Very pleased to have met you.	15.084476115419417
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	10.987468694451515
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	7.904606934116614
With J.	21.29673035124218
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	5.702763507952138
He stood to read the card in his hand.	12.331450363630582
— The reverend Hugh C.	9.837009641355655
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	10.711490508940225
Nice young chap he is.	12.934147118907925
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	9.004879054739778
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	10.811219795989928
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	7.590206796970279
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	9.321028386163592
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Molloy said.	8.650999131034373
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	11.561671153461495
— God! he cried.	14.347083047611553
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	10.300385822984715
You know that one?	19.391439085201505
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	10.038248351103245
What?	14.626800461768257
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	14.379848321749165
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	10.382624943385084
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	14.313052055092912
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	8.596339654359307
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	7.6179322027763305
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	11.804504763814238
What is it?	11.96707899805774
What ’ s the trouble?	15.212420776605347
Wait awhile.	18.6207345603246
Hold hard.	22.078542423565782
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	9.461054124954483
— Chow! he said.	11.291244421197645
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	10.176243730700477
J.	9.522090257552765
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	9.330205400664193
cold night before...	14.908504429928106
blast your soul...	15.602983107490061
night before last...	13.541705792507916
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	11.841998076071107
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	10.821069597473551
— I was...	11.769733493855352
Glasnevin this morning...	16.18878898378171
poor little...	15.174188762675083
what do you call him...	12.58497213564181
Chow!...	15.411247405184344
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	7.614808829859109
— See?	18.27233718651035
he said.	10.24588778153892
Say it ’ s turn six.	14.574980985824869
In here, see.	17.689864497856092
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	10.020678826295457
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	6.9418250643398
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	5.656719876118051
— See?	18.27233718651035
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	10.627157912085437
The impact.	22.23443618821369
Leverage, see?	18.58498536404308
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	8.745245656803627
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	9.278451566226082
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	9.346367643852496
— See?	18.27233718651035
Tom Rochford said.	14.024487168411023
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	6.887674335900362
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	12.36390198446204
One good turn deserves another.	12.04836960487339
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	10.15780303838859
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	12.876058517553249
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	10.132676082939462
When you two begin...	11.827636539443455
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	8.353676123789931
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	11.65338997507159
he asked.	10.114487674314143
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	10.010451678872279
See you later.	17.47316769729028
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	13.393110112393293
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	8.326816846869153
The drain, you mean.	13.68434298418197
— Drain?	20.244123350173457
Lenehan said.	15.184925532898774
It was down a manhole.	13.957884410420123
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	6.516708453374303
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	7.909203712894885
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	8.912666770811551
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	9.512912793283975
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	10.584731143406414
— The act of a hero, he said.	10.710011780518492
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	6.352113856692892
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	14.907566392378774
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	8.367386864302112
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	11.757149056986764
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	7.385500416306939
— After three, he said.	11.712636282873682
Who ’ s riding her?	13.458684346992309
— O.	13.92375821519351
Madden, Lenehan said.	15.039894636872067
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	6.579295703628817
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	8.379910214249968
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	8.754632877432543
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	13.465932761655344
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	8.910254055393732
Through here.	23.6334369805202
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	11.195375223493354
— There he is, Lenehan said.	11.184752298978788
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	10.129153959527091
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	8.97156249635093
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	7.813526183013318
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	11.289491151596808
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	9.139576298082874
Astronomy it was about.	20.962507509913426
Lenehan laughed.	25.72078603700453
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	8.154456242950113
Come over in the sun.	16.408921943234887
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	9.101913701698496
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	9.226888379123404
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	9.086119852219143
The annual dinner, you know.	12.457570936244482
Boiled shirt affair.	16.021350543371284
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	8.72808276924223
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	8.810741075571308
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	10.338840741507674
My missus sang there once.	11.69028813873895
— Did she?	17.7317074432689
Lenehan said.	15.184925532898774
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	6.2361133513927465
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	8.97758170015551
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	9.484253105987632
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	6.810259421178033
Bloom and the wife were there.	16.1645531698175
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	7.274906286654283
Fast and furious it was.	13.680352526796016
After liquids came solids.	10.446020717378017
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	6.671568215801509
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	8.326816846869153
The year the missus was there...	11.368693414876747
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	13.296406519364638
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	9.484253105987632
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	8.317307616876167
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	9.442967208883891
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	12.567107891790027
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	6.210144998883301
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	7.418987159921328
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	8.874781307731949
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	10.375170233932122
Like that.	17.107892394552803
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	7.579344675983619
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	8.621733359882862
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	11.173484588438132
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	10.041216216134226
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	8.007963369890385
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	12.447537742576912
He knows them all, faith.	14.300736130892835
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	12.11800165351906
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	13.633751366123745
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	9.894316298419664
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	8.867546545716868
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	10.144758702476269
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	8.826337886456693
Lenehan walked on again.	17.27784875171561
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	7.174148899263736
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	9.246108617768655
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	11.259615888202122
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	10.69444557404854
you know...	12.869077979874906
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	10.073583933330108
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	6.169670388800501
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	6.212121548371702
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	12.65449869887275
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	11.41346655469109
Child born every minute somewhere.	12.957023127193656
Mrs Purefoy.	23.24941089577332
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	6.296963985519914
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	13.574304330545415
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	8.539508508011068
— Them are two good ones, he said.	9.049488269719157
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	11.513339914021218
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	7.994688721368361
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	6.66575826964355
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	12.075586205756672
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	10.80903989530631
Know the kind that is.	14.326222064939365
Had it?	24.56945207122086
Yes.	14.818606210850463
He opened it.	16.765854898497494
Thought so.	20.91018932536612
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	11.547773958516723
Listen: the man.	18.83511989687272
Got her it once.	14.585790073911829
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	9.189009371159823
More in her line.	16.90992371067659
Let us see.	17.48523989807566
He read where his finger opened.	13.107520462880743
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	12.210230775400117
This.	28.773406683791585
Here.	19.774642670857872
Try.	41.684170622041364
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	7.0841438504892436
Take this.	25.62435547376532
The end.	21.342216362654238
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	7.75859762292398
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	6.118278045779325
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	9.156049316332243
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	6.760711597831258
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	5.872240313651411
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	9.9602373082744
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	8.774023685756234
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	11.339320461128647
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	8.04179065790387
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	5.784200003820342
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	8.434599606469675
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	7.902423914414329
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	6.990268443689755
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	7.074394904839979
Mr Bloom beheld it.	13.906455561719099
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	12.567918816099958
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	7.260584378364223
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	10.840759151209875
That ’ s a good one.	12.612096734155998
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	8.596598500714828
Four and nine.	17.639150733611615
Those lovely curtains.	15.848343339077426
Five shillings.	23.307665896203755
Cosy curtains.	21.19072365806589
Selling new at two guineas.	12.571256869814691
Any advance on five shillings?	12.76732355030344
Going for five shillings.	14.561683812850918
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	6.026519007801632
J.	9.522090257552765
A.	12.93983968749198
Jackson, W.	14.769064952713524

Munro and H.	16.121165265797647
T.	20.94091146181396
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	7.4019668041384
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	7.725357631928599
He halted near his daughter.	13.9507688107372
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	12.724887777775134
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	9.065676252702715
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	8.269820641616406
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	9.717494300162873
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	12.613603565323086
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	8.933178617674777
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	9.718265149709966
Do you know what you look like?	14.207283157488641
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	7.6698312963656345
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	11.779488689636485
All the people are looking at you.	12.188088923092256
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	8.9658476735208
— Did you get any money?	13.016631864578688
Dilly asked.	25.03954687679941
— Where would I get money?	14.063706227449579
Mr Dedalus said.	8.513263235908282
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	10.892460826090591
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	10.944057542606025
— How do you know that?	13.84101514429888
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	12.48682534605708
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	7.726085360908324
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	12.124565484115562
Were you in the Scotch house now?	12.803388107848473
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	11.659559080054029
Here.	19.774642670857872
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	12.01330574550765
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	9.093168726339037
Give me more than that.	17.223234301885256
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	12.755420712725114
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	13.473107022988168
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	8.136230883001696
But wait awhile.	15.728692736238473
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	9.659524280430297
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	12.166243861486587
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	12.479878358207799
He ’ s dead.	13.699592357421201
The man upstairs is dead.	11.369696991630962
He left her and walked on.	15.074186002071189
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	12.18336770760083
— Well, what is it?	12.535501034015132
he said, stopping.	12.749502890078839
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	8.258070671721553
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	9.458968531567715
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	6.629902183893484
— Watch him, he said.	11.907538787415183
It ’ s instructive.	14.946165391963824
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	10.506482587706763
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	9.654194993816352
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	9.643800035723729
Look, there ’ s all I have.	17.0682133829406
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	9.002479566347994
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	8.766845859995179
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	13.676930909178434
Dilly said.	19.272021180258943
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	12.793008368381946
— I will, he said gravely.	13.796328558091352
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	9.567694389750361
I ’ ll try this one now.	10.57702400208802
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	9.308303844715285
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	10.774813264197196
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	10.492709760042292
I ’ ll be home shortly.	10.368749701751137
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	11.28520394474442
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	7.921857657109741
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	8.150215157567088
The lacquey banged loudly.	11.044075756927635
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	6.818926086598439
Got round him all right.	15.936573496597338
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	14.119166895026993
First rate, sir.	14.269780367061701
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	10.288966932903264
How are things going?	14.289875008175237
Just keeping alive.	15.006568165232016
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	15.480371734558293
Yes, indeed.	16.153672235198908
Good for the country.	18.697761185168265
Those farmers are always grumbling.	11.12152396504519
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	8.384478541718014
Yes, sir.	9.980117867118919
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	7.352269619193506
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	10.728414157313196
And heartrending scenes.	15.36054913163177
Men trampling down women and children.	10.942103746885332
Most brutal thing.	16.05263691375511
What do they say was the cause?	14.373815835333382
Spontaneous combustion.	20.487164663877625
Most scandalous revelation.	15.186299355072865
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	7.359382868344621
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	8.850467514860549
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	12.725179356115312
You know why?	17.872418812434148
Palm oil.	22.8500035582409
Is that a fact?	14.098810335805986
Without a doubt.	19.576698839644504
Well now, look at that.	18.212210941815584
And America they say is the land of the free.	13.378157702955852
I thought we were bad here.	12.07410183268215
I smiled at him.	16.791281405270016
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	15.231118100980995
_What is it?	19.47602445481773
The sweepings of every country including our own.	9.136043270218034
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	13.40857615666593
Graft, my dear sir.	15.365837737659003
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	11.245878556027987
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	13.68632812126191
Dress does it.	17.67988639280829
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	12.786234665064516
Bowls them over.	18.496991345961995
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	8.561120160884263
How are things?	15.712966043032832
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	10.202846692100358
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	7.614612568926021
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	12.391278553348016
Scott of Dawson street.	13.10168226930244
Never built under three guineas.	12.255273734643694
Fits me down to the ground.	15.727994831252625
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	9.356875528361936
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	8.316075859711448
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	10.783882581937048
Knight of the road.	16.589789557750347
Gentleman.	51.72916675838559
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	10.106766769058517
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	9.458007250654452
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	6.085317930826762
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	10.410387577688487
High colour, of course.	16.660854974384637
Grizzled moustache.	22.925021111502165
Returned Indian officer.	15.789079728975246
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	6.486755294919866
Is that Ned Lambert ’ s brother over the way, Sam?	12.56023437497092
What?	14.626800461768257
Yes.	14.818606210850463
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	10.748954105318019
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	9.428532558830836
Damn like him.	19.376710739719975
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	6.579153742240492
Good drop of gin, that was.	12.2871042663756
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	7.902324870500217
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	8.804830847575438
Greasy black rope.	16.544582089298228
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant ’ s wife drove by in her noddy.	10.059975187586563
Bad times those were.	15.242852642605744
Well, well.	16.81888006694632
Over and done with.	17.11872954510666
Great topers too.	15.84141823960117
Fourbottle men.	23.711855941156188
Let me see.	13.541932993565945
Is he buried in saint Michan ’ s?	10.14264331793369
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	11.565689418400488
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	12.276209747361133
Dignam is there now.	17.607726133763677
Went out in a puff.	17.746340299834284
Well, well.	16.81888006694632
Better turn down here.	13.947136194001363
Make a detour.	14.670411130717655
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	6.843810496072503
Damn dangerous thing.	15.476415355072076
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	7.968448541727522
Runaway horse.	23.743825884989803
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton ’ s office, led his wife over O ’ Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	7.649755767606057
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	10.952463459246236
Times of the troubles.	18.33167537661989
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	12.450130371289161
Gaming at Daly ’ s.	11.30169864980736
No cardsharping then.	14.636534286141336
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	10.847380577259997
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	7.032898824630363
Stables behind Moira house.	12.057540892673291
Damn good gin that was.	12.917549319629991
Fine dashing young nobleman.	11.562286256338526
Good stock, of course.	15.874527412552021
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	9.523940309513439
Course they were on the wrong side.	15.240470725054939
They rose in dark and evil days.	11.56386607491994
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	13.483172796477003
They were gentlemen.	17.043691262426048
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	9.6261514400202
Masterly rendition.	21.50892676324382
_At the siege of Ross did my father <URL> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	6.4527642674386225
Frockcoats.	44.80800061837366
Cream sunshades.	20.80079920813608
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	9.965793902012846
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	8.308362577426085
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	6.973218462853529
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	11.02404380698538
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	8.576818133792715
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	5.846383843155954
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	8.64870563773363
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	9.38452418707475
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	5.989687202233976
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	6.723025983389164
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	6.314286116289929
A long and seafed silent rut.	9.592373989607186
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	6.464608184821638
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	8.182103237706182

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	7.266720324943843
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	5.959460480892063
Beingless beings.	22.35669612553341
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	9.05702765374888
Your heart you sing of.	12.716664840015717
I between them.	19.176250669757223
Where?	20.27410746882259
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	9.190800139901512
Shatter them, one and both.	18.45561746113403
But stun myself too in the blow.	10.893157490114408
Shatter me you who can.	15.013428975896797
Bawd and butcher were the words.	12.748916167675311
I say! Not yet awhile.	12.880631645200094
A look around.	17.22048333039888
Yes, quite true.	15.149312212901224
You say right, sir.	12.903522012590653
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	8.279440456712058
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	6.757014706179104

The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	6.126611296331501
And they are throbbing: heroes ’ hearts.	8.58685336382759
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	8.852460316661352

Shut the book quick.	16.366234339023922

Stephen said.	11.94982048593145
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	6.589176345395931
It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	8.419528992843412

Stephen asked.	15.303264734747627
— I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.	11.076925105620345
Is it any good?	17.735616308126517

— What did you buy that for?	12.879581652663637
he asked.	10.114487674314143
To learn French?	18.006530494036408
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	7.94230794386408

Quite natural.	25.272001879640506

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	8.04439039796811
How are things?	15.712966043032832
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	10.202846692100358
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	7.036742623054231
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	7.584100567407623
— What ’ s the best news?	10.81476532693258
Mr Dedalus said.	8.513263235908282
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	9.471704133964062
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	8.357921913432017
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	10.442225073568157
Who is it?	17.668547095409632
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	11.476320790315102
— With a broken back, is it?	11.959707008898013
Mr Dedalus asked.	11.693952645412276
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	12.003217297487044
Reuben of that ilk.	17.87676709113586
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	11.423120051336104
All I want is a little time.	14.884520318250061
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	9.562271110736546
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	12.709535852902222
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	10.72409834866581
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	10.46291284307773
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	12.639987518756586
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	6.2975838005405755
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	7.181865829654904
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	10.276517534215479
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	10.32533170189383
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	8.17236387645629
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	9.6595479406871
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	8.080197689908196
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	9.17901606570281
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	8.858195689945125
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	14.368962142839107
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	8.44795952216791
Father Cowley asked.	15.83780998581792
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	5.997617206454012
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	8.706515695539006
— Aw! he said.	10.5958880729917
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	10.129179928912189
— What about that?	16.034154156958834
Ben Dollard said.	12.4200690821962
Not too dusty?	17.309000665828886
What?	14.626800461768257
He turned to both.	14.038352863164718
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	10.472799700578383
The reverend Hugh C.	10.183827855696345
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	8.034334280622186
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	10.00664718506589
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	10.060021227482082
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	7.739545403427673
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	10.71205194280701
Come along.	23.736534788809912
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	8.246100344088296
Wait awhile...	14.10009595118898
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	11.199599794193901
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	11.278409340222515
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	7.0373044343952404
— What few days?	15.172715313283362
he boomed.	20.50672046414343
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	9.231918697496438
— He has, Father Cowley said.	10.00899559879483
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	8.819727526030071
The landlord has the prior claim.	10.090434413631321
I gave him all the particulars.	14.182145818675085
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	13.332640760471577
Love is the name?	21.58477722820695
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	9.753865847886006
The reverend Mr Love.	14.129892535068683
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	10.699755246294096
But are you sure of that?	17.50042165006524
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	9.10015051795158
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	9.57611273070997
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	9.807173988654743
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	9.779192345470518
The policeman touched his forehead.	12.598333581628284
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	10.732940279848618
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	7.865069134888237
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	8.941238358648954
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	9.486018833993645
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	11.094994391337691
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	10.758578186346904
— Boyd?	23.114410966387492
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	12.50718809691977
Touch me not.	18.84452451463269
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	7.8280345098852635
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	6.010853520900135
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	7.684630708102704
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	8.81118329121016
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	11.328360840091925
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	11.222808277329566
And put down the five shillings too.	12.781033123385296
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	9.566628507226095
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	10.385142466059127
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	10.18306019670632
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	7.889303682842962
They went down Parliament street.	12.266739874436443
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	8.496452251715299
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	8.743572769284537
Here goes.	21.261082093776924
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	6.694185026632687
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	7.090767117562855
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	7.280397649473296
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	9.709390807791829
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	7.842382728386673
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	7.481423440475737
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	9.691614511369075
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	10.241917717456458
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	9.699768032189613
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	10.187997416073888
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	7.045603397950735
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	5.814453426643211
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	8.239175028854673
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	7.53973892278756
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	10.81035297880102
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	6.429485264045511
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	11.252128182609452
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	8.906033142934557
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	7.432742790467411
— What Dignam was that?	13.500167509149996
long John Fanning asked.	13.002551657655262
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	11.419189178394886
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	11.35333752780922
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	9.232216363622989
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	7.3902656599136005
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	10.978774268999706
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	11.674937705835505
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	9.151037642022654
— Rather lowsized.	14.151101533112445
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	10.226170821765768
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	10.625826171926686
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	9.097409224346844
— What ’ s that?	10.254129274625361
Martin Cunningham said.	8.707693961679244
All turned where they stood.	14.593006616897485
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	11.058039511349666
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	7.822181287997986
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	9.729316966588634
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	8.309746761764192
— What was it?	15.768852098152268
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	12.513282053219179
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	7.819470665674167
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	7.532680921147666
There in the corner.	16.427477804873014
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	7.455004532683093
— Is that he?	14.500431565494884
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	12.857791027946991
— Yes, Mulligan said.	11.17348951053059
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	10.545679796707198
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	7.974865794158692
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	8.155051686766893
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	9.517573740290118
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	8.329484979425922
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	9.549180066915909
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	11.4863099866292
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	7.895193640029847
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	8.975359892322386
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	9.596442556134992
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	7.466824142532031
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	8.474326701997766
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	12.037019911233642
Wandering Ængus I call him.	13.086607190715357
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	7.49394716731882
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	11.100746450316539
Such persons always have.	13.421068100860918
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	10.522600866361604
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	10.436998970521186
He will never capture the Attic note.	8.094247475747089
That is his tragedy.	15.971014275263478
He can never be a poet.	15.330817807723218
The joy of creation...	11.505542639010537
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	10.649775456932645
I see.	15.487968460281955
I tackled him this morning on belief.	11.47483423761094
There was something on his mind, I saw.	16.409026079165933
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	7.753535241888414
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	8.567379235125173
He helped her to unload her tray.	9.381143135422441
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	7.992466589535533
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	8.380794340681186
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	10.868315313065857
Does he write anything for your movement?	11.841393277108695
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	6.991471936281922
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	6.318504813628288
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	12.586522261545454
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	14.378255890594298
He is going to write something in ten years.	12.507518822861893
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	10.564862383272928
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	10.992795038317848
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	8.19022837911683
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	11.201076868747267
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	9.841558952180069
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	4.992014238104856
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	7.378588063343526
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	6.171179536073089
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	10.171168951249655
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	6.06281470815227
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	8.139466593837694
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	9.736681537286284
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	6.432756867241101
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	6.080104626780854
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	7.768013694858776
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	7.414178764876939
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	6.666701224268383
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	6.4963997232202
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	7.183787678539234
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	6.220733955992073
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	12.060932382109025
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	13.055806875695682
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	8.708551019649999
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	9.75838643367653
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	13.918996709076417
That ’ s me in mourning.	12.896863842080247
When is it?	18.98982733540653
May the twentysecond.	16.17080935484296
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	11.992527448641432
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	10.8100545728154
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	8.39694989342148
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	8.487604094004157
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	10.543654456768472
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	8.621652428961374
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	9.522923038208464
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	6.456037614905566
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	8.692543425515854
No Sandymount tram.	16.715308925674652
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	8.628982961617677
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	10.94027492998205
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	7.782658921834268
He met schoolboys with satchels.	10.677789938258547
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	8.2676496973756
He met other schoolboys.	13.205437334802735
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	13.669332980479039
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	13.612938008355922
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	11.084589639784905
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	10.727250571326367
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	8.603471564384295
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	8.767251018552567
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	11.842152188858929
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	8.358902882488483
Never see him again.	15.583925448262233
Death, that is.	18.77693350549306
Pa is dead.	17.77772250716604
My father is dead.	15.16696558395628
He told me to be a good son to ma.	13.73755315868118
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	11.800082274306003
Poor pa.	23.77835046748529
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	14.108853977962164
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	9.807279984507277
* * * William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge.	6.149850399954508

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.	6.731816209156673
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis.	9.53293075938478
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar.	7.2679133820158865
Between Queen ’ s and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley ’ s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B.	6.494770790015974

White ’ s, the pawnbroker ’ s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.	7.078676222601057
In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	6.934900378801923
Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King ’ s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty.	6.056617981322029

From Cahill ’ s corner the reverend Hugh C.	9.95072778942259
Love, M.	16.84534637366247
A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	5.151008923270258
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	7.856884626139854
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	6.092324271210152
The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	6.947701843412669

Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade.	7.294167227061893
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	9.056854229212783
A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	5.717323876430962

Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently.	6.472474111187193
In Fownes ’ s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal ’ s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	5.788794040416894
John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it.	6.110255621628063
Where the foreleg of King Billy ’ s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders.	6.876558252553947
She shouted in his ear the tidings.	13.050315049908797
Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage.	9.490930177973501
The honourable Gerald Ward A.	10.318952929768129
C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply.	8.007001876824964
At Ponsonby ’ s corner a jaded white flagon H.	7.716788217692962

Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	8.556809508097642
— Is that her?	15.072011040666156
asked miss Kennedy.	19.115771595304203
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	7.528009434037832
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	9.996804086549627
— Who?	12.696584449771581
Where?	20.27410746882259
gold asked more eagerly.	11.536514778545726
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	10.39129587923576
He ’ s looking.	14.781116949770427
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	7.321043056949418
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	11.019707093399575
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	8.981811843485886
With sadness.	21.118367177155736
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	7.365583002381684
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	9.64723450792995
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	7.822088513927477
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	8.654687175166496
A man.	17.66272508527008
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	6.453092632954473
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	11.82410997610155
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	10.999185928069979
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	6.290864771270279
— What is it?	10.27386930003328
loud boots unmannerly asked.	11.424467375850675
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	9.082603282497635
— Your _beau, _ is it?	10.620054653610524
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	8.635814636626433
Bloom.	18.147734167807787
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	8.182161938133806
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	9.647431760256104
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	12.882911398499548
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	10.739703219898871
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	10.190521605023347
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	7.026977609166306
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	8.57166192582479
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	7.627637625657421
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	10.38759596928069
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	11.348211052507438
It gets brown after.	13.854761610266985
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	7.9953459976818175
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	11.203500471526196
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	10.752930838438319
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	7.194275582928239
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	10.219553147668188
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	9.151393205467045
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	7.780777635138805
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	12.007209083940408
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	11.056890048918342
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	7.405841317289266
says he.	14.955382316123046
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	10.79991379653887
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	8.217322075910982
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	7.149098922625151
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	7.64968244430855
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	7.655695351912905
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	5.844266725182581
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	9.71812900055267
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	11.243359603567521
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	7.018330246097334
Why do I always think Figather?	13.0985464266034
Gathering figs, I think.	13.606278909001645
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	8.070393307831917
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	9.693695649196234
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	13.883542106417249
God they believe she is: or goddess.	13.03686906108982
Those today.	22.536962356893127
I could not see.	15.716251720317914
That fellow spoke.	17.495588791051293
A student.	22.98259016242343
After with Dedalus ’ son.	12.72240562763075
He might be Mulligan.	15.953609442290903
All comely virgins.	15.73000306139634
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	8.935423888470977
By went his eyes.	14.997433446246218
The sweets of sin.	11.024475708992146
Sweet are the sweets.	16.170354136068365
Of sin.	23.162021222258215
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	6.232684280141852
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	7.690756223271151
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	7.843632058238853
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	7.850014529665548
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	7.094765595884884
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	6.893107082576296
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	9.497196431869764
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	6.269668540724826
And then laughed more.	13.785428268764713
Greasy I knows.	18.54561616821094
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	5.867227342863231
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	11.315663095803776
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	15.58093502975568
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	8.30435545263886
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	12.10568078715964
I feel all wet.	15.561109694039613
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	10.16067520213411
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	9.03687724344254
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	6.611455690436869
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	8.870140095605565
Religion pays.	23.02722228403958
Must see him for that par.	16.98358368588844
Eat first.	23.650848096368833
I want.	19.69023235224184
Not yet.	17.95654893996674
At four, she said.	12.635074749962632
Time ever passing.	17.187567318316443
Clockhands turning.	23.602969148653447
On. Where eat?	13.926890585728891
The Clarence, Dolphin.	13.305520962800703
On. For Raoul.	12.476378387856451
Eat.	41.08374488525613
If I net five guineas with those ads.	9.168879990132073
The violet silk petticoats.	14.50895460811087
Not yet.	17.95654893996674
The sweets of sin.	11.024475708992146
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	9.323291137026992
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	11.331999690970694
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	9.164495415514134
He strolled.	21.322918892210552
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	11.547035305006455
He held her hand.	14.845674691574445
Enjoyed her holidays?	15.727557288704492
— Tiptop.	19.63543908355642
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	8.627640427836711
— Gorgeous, she said.	11.246896793003993
Lying out on the strand all day.	14.220608937641467
Bronze whiteness.	21.4536840214305
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	10.044885150162305
Tempting poor simple males.	12.82709495857863
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	8.163373410394966
— O go away! she said.	10.876808054700476
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	10.873683350090243
He was.	16.076476437509932
— Well now I am, he mused.	13.922366613585803
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	8.467190787784368
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	9.243243339997877
And what did the doctor order today?	12.635046106576024
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	10.77639760287769
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	11.460502320034175
Jingle.	31.625606075377878
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	9.866890490233242
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	7.723814373886966
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	7.644494520021637
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	9.611406598801326
Alacrity she served.	16.410192671035542
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	7.568370193827838
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	9.714303535801415
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	12.05430539008485
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	10.15476753060477
Yes.	14.818606210850463
Yes.	14.818606210850463
Yes.	14.818606210850463
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	10.12885916733106
Chips.	43.60652022518163
Shreds.	44.80800061837366
Musing.	44.80800061837366
Mute.	49.786713264135244
None nought said nothing.	14.274238110827483
Yes.	14.818606210850463
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	7.7936952804615265
In came Lenehan.	17.396738619465484
Round him peered Lenehan.	13.471900486670592
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	11.070130530447313
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	10.603402097366768
To Martha I must write.	14.33545332776612
Buy paper.	22.88452386385486
Daly ’ s.	19.356827192411796
Girl there civil.	17.67040664285035
Bloom.	18.147734167807787
Old Bloom.	20.954725231575445
Blue bloom is on the rye.	12.119069595299859
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	9.312446057038217
Lenehan came forward.	21.502648513068397
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	12.884841958685465
He asked.	18.215181885293365
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	11.021161224069854
She asked.	19.437681336916967
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	10.06652442117333
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	9.175291479434796
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	15.715465719046547
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	8.393460024693901
To mind her stops.	13.947698369421934
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	8.060182825046986
Jingle jaunty jingle.	14.93749378027121
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	13.250060456873788
Take no notice.	18.517990563287775
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	6.663248602512963
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	5.971236446885842
He droned in vain.	12.235879258026385
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	12.858033688675565
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	10.211458255371824
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	11.188752402057997
— Who may he be?	11.313842259185266
Mr Dedalus asked.	11.693952645412276
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	11.714611367164766
Who?	24.00141934869033
— Who may he be?	11.313842259185266
he asked.	10.114487674314143
Can you ask?	20.77009789381894
Dry.	44.80800061837366
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	8.857859199133175
— I see, he said.	10.750830815671577
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	12.326720898551606
I hear he is keeping very select company.	9.534966893724878
Have you seen him lately?	13.210572240574079
He had.	18.8656564526718
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	9.181669028538023
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	8.134623107836422
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	6.7361933706297386
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	8.849244828958824
I see.	15.487968460281955
He see.	21.32897087849914
He drank.	19.771261499643366
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	10.567811758252887
Set down his glass.	16.663974144104778
— I see you have moved the piano.	11.802663663451671
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	8.627332878271027
— Is that a fact?	10.989235786507487
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	15.36446899240708
The real classical, you know.	12.445854813555835
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	14.495313621028904
— Is that a fact?	10.989235786507487
Mr Dedalus said.	8.513263235908282
He drank and strayed away.	10.60742146489592
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	11.83780893564625
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	9.67364885181786
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	9.422565448674822
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	8.870589102197892
Lager for diner.	17.412678192789915
Lager without alacrity she served.	10.597274306528325
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	7.642117726751834
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	7.836791114842539
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	7.265212099903075
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	7.263246058936472
Are you not happy in your home?	11.704850746176545
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	9.925493348723407
Means something, language of flow.	12.561753276434358
Was it a daisy?	14.76682644168826
Innocence that is.	19.541917237819522
Respectable girl meet after mass.	11.342907141844133
Thanks awfully muchly.	15.130893434776672
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	7.612103647874697
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	8.3379571942297
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	11.80963018010051
For some man.	19.106457475318514
For Raoul.	18.908469142825542
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	7.219684250877286
It is.	14.214041752081366
Again.	34.96590279256636
Coincidence.	32.13850438451833
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	7.501971471565637
Follow.	44.19093781523242
Risk it.	23.83813679680877
Go quick.	24.732576684861886
At four.	18.61851896913681
Near now.	22.71238082411604
Out.	30.126521725037115
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	10.682866526867985
— Aha...	14.747637511087499
I was forgetting...	13.111178119225718
Excuse...	18.630115237132205
— And four.	16.681537231983558
At four she.	15.139788966370094
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	10.66431347966451
Bloo smi qui go.	11.489842624585501
Ternoon.	44.80800061837366
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	11.26648715200399
For men.	24.570646697108764
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	9.876488057073182
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	9.664630926648105
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	9.729924851268107
A call again.	16.608958400408557
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	10.812591543853154
You hear?	23.56798802860394
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	6.280919569549043
Longer in dying call.	14.68138488853974
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	6.783274878621461
— _The bright stars fade_...	9.25998921410699
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	8.630234840444672
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	6.064665852820034
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	8.394522311240344
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	8.445121868883009
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	9.017596683698489
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	12.050154157299131
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	9.525083386817425
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	6.722040656047449
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	10.439007231118975
he asked her.	14.779618408609798
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	8.954702385656562
Like lady, ladylike.	15.267125910171641
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	7.624172064117445
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	11.204844834528382
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	9.055462247540094
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	9.36406114785465
See me he might.	19.89195320439562
The seat he sat on: warm.	12.979365978816093
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	6.9746660980573045
— _And I from thee_...	8.946543768068322
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	11.076254068905882
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	8.270016476816146
She smiled on him.	16.996939154361115
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	7.955879302423044
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	11.043456470543836
— What ’ s your cry?	12.882961969983333
Glass of bitter?	17.850478196729703
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	10.580793210685977
Not yet.	17.95654893996674
At four she.	15.139788966370094
Who said four?	18.54113886991088
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	9.317106818418159
Avoid.	44.80800061837366
Goulding a chance.	18.962393416431294
What is he doing in the Ormond?	14.046591535242229
Car waiting.	24.093099615303878
Wait.	16.117996620458218
Hello.	26.156206652584363
Where off to?	21.20354565997117
Something to eat?	19.73222228382561
I too was just.	19.303804289126262
In here.	21.562644267318362
What, Ormond?	14.90754230578506
Best value in Dublin.	14.470377051502878
Is that so?	18.81120412462808
Diningroom.	44.80800061837366
Sit tight there.	17.037482014362535
See, not be seen.	17.58809950037739
I think I ’ ll join you.	13.260432244100839
Come on.	18.31575871878564
Richie led on.	20.80459122661198
Bloom followed bag.	18.65728313891144
Dinner fit for a prince.	17.072721971766818
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	7.971379771228452
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	9.081992544447727
— Why don ’ t you grow?	14.046893865096676
asked Blazes Boylan.	15.05008265429529
That is to say she.	18.212582664187856
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	9.477094440496096
He pitched a broad coin down.	10.234314232640793
Coin rang.	19.486928937811467
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	12.437461080527166
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	8.424297671203886
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	8.89799197953534
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	9.06765514116913
Not on my own, you know.	15.517596372545217
Fancy of a friend of mine.	14.305089753331194
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	7.6644136228939495
Idolores.	48.507117681250556
The eastern seas.	16.171002667131788
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	8.143562160083171
Clock clacked.	15.566878809434535
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	8.370745940126051
It clanged.	22.24338196464855
Clock clacked.	15.566878809434535
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	7.3577258657514975
Look to the west.	16.286580932598504
A clack.	22.32113799667934
For me.	21.61091459424095
— What time is that?	14.09694032496441
asked Blazes Boylan.	15.05008265429529
Four?	47.36342042628462
O ’ clock.	18.16625565432105
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	6.498255548245959
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	11.144784097321546
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	6.820369840747943
Be near.	24.02566443723078
At four.	18.61851896913681
Has he forgotten?	17.636287994054765
Perhaps a trick.	16.56843446079245
Not come: whet appetite.	9.839253303814479
I couldn ’ t do.	15.080207504842603
Wait, wait.	16.990522759242673
Pat, waiter, waited.	11.150485242876291
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	7.1256088448748365
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	11.429815214707451
There ’ s no - one.	11.255736770069209
He never heard.	19.576284002348725
—...	7.713744315454603
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	8.192003389706874
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	7.873303284257635
— Please, please.	13.762794089898279
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	7.696234241420511
— _I could not leave thee_...	10.229357677801607
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	9.681391587405585
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	12.233966892277788
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	10.19116646962165
She looked.	22.4953275560553
Quick.	32.272501947498284
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	11.864222671185313
Sudden bent.	24.065710007776936
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	9.702868088513892
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	9.346882382106035
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	7.136874213095181
Delayed.	44.80800061837366
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	8.273784142185157
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	11.348296829590703
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	5.998025154493659
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	8.911914618740369
Trained by owner.	15.769145555265375
No sawdust there.	16.62434005647003
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	7.122160507280989
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	7.406390065654742
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	14.103144436907973
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	6.642226088119345
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	5.9570185409148815
Yes, bronze from anearby.	12.65384210895031
—...	7.713744315454603
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	12.172463932542197
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	8.279591840119238
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	9.466801081132575
I wanted to tell you.	15.03817102389741
Tom Rochford...	13.614419690198032
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	10.327527223197249
Lenehan gulped to go.	14.284630153640204
— Got the horn or what?	12.2086159934318
he said.	10.24588778153892
Wait.	16.117996620458218
I ’ m coming.	12.871611736682045
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	13.947029538315691
— Eh?	17.54159321837913
How do?	20.004764717454588
How do?	20.004764717454588
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	8.615034970165313
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	12.035599959305532
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	12.073247691492353
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	8.731329031161588
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	8.816626029984446
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	9.533329256945336
Come on, Simon.	15.734787462770074
Give us a ditty.	14.455605797794547
We heard the piano.	17.161516082449285
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	7.85352278177512
Power for Richie.	19.826338372741887
And Bloom?	24.264027758608215
Let me see.	13.541932993565945
Not make him walk twice.	13.416635310662052
His corns.	24.18033787517526
Four now.	23.973006166265947
How warm this black is.	11.957457684521373
Course nerves a bit.	15.03441492830362
Refracts (is it?) heat.	14.72033565875942
Let me see.	13.541932993565945
Cider.	44.19093781523242
Yes, bottle of cider.	13.171326193485793
— What ’ s that?	10.254129274625361
Mr Dedalus said.	8.513263235908282
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	12.875081515719879
Begone dull care.	17.72579776488775
Come, Bob.	19.558018966221177
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	8.200647975700935
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	8.870416478735994
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	13.174665416575493
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	9.143653196378498
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	12.923045013678603
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	10.996377901898867
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	12.268913970547514
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	12.163429079977321
He ’ s off.	15.054070303795363
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	7.903811088730939
Jingling.	43.051840588071244
He ’ s gone.	11.379345982159853
Jingle.	31.625606075377878
Hear.	45.634394343290865
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	9.204197140377424
God be with old times.	17.04366279693167
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	7.818816513162469
Gone.	25.531946322204362
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	7.860912107034191
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	6.597572895933996
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	8.660252824558393
There was.	18.92917281356788
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	10.095888660820917
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	12.210761889542715
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	8.663374765949044
— God, do you remember?	16.059749622768106
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	10.573544153133867
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	9.220121824776054
They laughed all three.	14.921080430024976
He had no wed.	15.682175987064486
All trio laughed.	13.870894818910246
No wedding garment.	15.391867499673287
— Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	9.099493188982581

By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady ’ s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.	6.441036361245053
The harping chords of prelude closed.	9.46515773174929
A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.	7.76232100088065

Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet.	9.15044958649203
Love ’ s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	8.590211879592625
Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	5.760425298505104

at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye.	7.877401995948356
I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.	8.335174023549987
— Lo, Joe, says I.	11.05318527170045
How are you blowing?	16.296734221199458
Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	9.522839651869585
— Soot ’ s luck, says Joe.	9.127677375202401
Who ’ s the old ballocks you were talking to?	12.426397513787471
— Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	14.417759858200373
— What are you doing round those parts?	10.831178730089363
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Devil a much, says I.	12.251257092259447
There ’ s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane — old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him — lifted any God ’ s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop - of - my - thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.	7.0006910233802655
— Circumcised?	20.244123350173457
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Ay, says I.	9.563808337931215
A bit off the top.	16.109868884155368
An old plumber named Geraghty.	10.647206230763915
I ’ m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can ’ t get a penny out of him.	10.464439807320979
— That the lay you ’ re on now?	11.404582237734173
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Ay, says I.	9.563808337931215
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts.	6.952744841370216
But that ’ s the most notorious bloody robber you ’ d meet in a day ’ s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.	9.873998028496363

— Are you a strict <URL>.?	11.347800620388268
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	9.357107488816036
— What about paying our respects to our friend?	9.407966752024237
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Who?	12.696584449771581
says I.	14.93050077080704
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	15.06911575573525
— Drinking his own stuff?	13.564922044720266
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Ay, says I.	9.563808337931215
Whisky and water on the brain.	13.155112693437394
— Come around to Barney Kiernan ’ s, says Joe.	9.190384300502858
I want to see the citizen.	14.356758931352438
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	9.908804967134705
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	12.20660644448869
— Not a word, says Joe.	12.327478608937707
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	11.543253033755269
— What was that, Joe?	15.397308087915233
says I.	14.93050077080704
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	10.520920053299072
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	10.193959626226953
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	9.07861400270439
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	11.764461174173293
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	10.472030417304186
For trading without a licence, says he.	10.592714382876354
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	10.081111848039669
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	8.874367182655346
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	7.293437275608286
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	5.258431347004564
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	5.484353141097766
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	5.300107435696763
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	6.263410582775609
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	5.383680128625004
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	4.0601942792473125
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	14.67903730451289
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	4.488641296050177
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	10.091237527070556
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	9.156554116535416
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	10.537546832706635
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	10.144102648837467
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	8.321789115905144
— Stand and deliver, says he.	9.955159018291635
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	9.427948260001076
Friends here.	24.497930941952617
— Pass, friends, says he.	11.231658588897526
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	12.74011938729313
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	8.573764075363671
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	11.168653138453765
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	9.85708443337824
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	8.888562070851249
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	10.280909284797598
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	8.295967398417512
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	9.052377953480924
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	10.765769450634094
— Wine of the country, says he.	12.850207644128362
— What ’ s yours?	12.790749420886415
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	9.29258109435375
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	8.803378663384402
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	14.959087079288558
says he.	14.955382316123046
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	8.440883106711581
What Garry?	22.60327697090462
Are we going to win?	15.005171032592875
Eh?	23.58146863325907
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	10.61072627967866
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	4.769186185984854
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	6.047362242547905
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	6.482939340266273
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	8.202498321540169
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	5.584813917679022
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	6.12933143637364
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	6.208995077394057
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	5.451733489672663
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	4.160922372217593

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	5.2045901427761825
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	8.46185849361412
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	12.178763956803264
A goodlooking sovereign.	16.512091297508853
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	10.311903104788401
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	8.802203691099457
says I.	14.93050077080704
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	9.672275298902136
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	8.378804673179985
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	9.033835314952796
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	7.989345324081308
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	13.169868545935023
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	9.509960164405193
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	9.78914752458128
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	11.097974820861028
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	10.264286883657892
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	8.488741195386114
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	9.259403861705124
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	6.663058520567662
How ’ s that, eh?	12.768208070659758
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	5.2325340509296545
Eh?	23.58146863325907
Deaths.	44.80800061837366
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	5.938748720647222
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	12.147678715750263
— Cockburn.	22.153287018045344
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	6.211990631490373
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	9.232257996009858
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	10.833568753801151
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	12.122063942540482
Drink that, citizen.	16.943006093011366
— I will, says he, honourable person.	12.980373450386928
— Health, Joe, says I.	10.651257433004787
And all down the form.	15.447501695358078
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	9.716094706010573
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	9.493633226120563
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	6.787823551528585
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	8.294201595027152
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	10.384016914087962
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	9.826513647957603
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	7.276494475470768
I thought Alf would split.	12.075136178719436
— Look at him, says he.	13.497678725771415
Breen.	46.91518688748365
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	8.498510723684308
p: up on it to take a li...	11.409525960222851
And he doubled up.	13.643544872830837
— Take a what?	14.145209315585152
says I.	14.93050077080704
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	10.848832978572128
— O hell! says I.	12.476305463439038
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	8.977146864423643
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	7.449361232288272
— Who?	12.696584449771581
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Breen, says Alf.	13.441636252043708
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	10.170847464492828
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	14.630798061716076

The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	9.077421134930185
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	10.066535796314527
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	10.542068743777564
Is that Alf Bergan?	14.667329433466337
— Yes, says Alf.	9.200435929179845
Hanging?	46.33315554496968
Wait till I show you.	12.16556855967198

— Who are you laughing at?	11.689180731303026
says Bob Doran.	13.19929730908105
Is that Bergan?	17.380457575899268
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	10.685146882373209
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	6.000741222817534
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	5.58174501758565
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	7.224103289187083
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	6.513660131076995
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	6.701843791428955
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	9.467548742897163
— What ’ s that?	10.254129274625361
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	9.72586764079328
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	11.760616509331765
Hangmen ’ s letters.	14.98087648788515
Look at here.	14.689176367951523
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	9.441676119023414
— Are you codding?	12.320576184130845
says I.	14.93050077080704
— Honest injun, says Alf.	9.4870012155042
Read them.	23.900676461823885
So Joe took up the letters.	14.054340799273806
— Who are you laughing at?	11.689180731303026
says Bob Doran.	13.19929730908105
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	15.45184881736688
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	10.87823888385316
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	9.806195620624917
Only I was running after that...	12.961258849806757
— You what?	16.20499786282993
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	11.234874589907712
With who?	26.95868878916584
— With Dignam, says Alf.	12.004737604138466
— Is it Paddy?	14.705375044226919
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Yes, says Alf.	9.200435929179845
Why?	18.42545846291693
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	12.536914634842155
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	10.274661488025115
— Ay, says Joe.	8.220110769393216
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	9.408963194292559
— Who ’ s dead?	13.686111319081043
says Bob Doran.	13.19929730908105
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	10.763849250488265
— What?	11.791741423260737
says Alf.	13.175221141786889
Good Christ, only five...	12.424229399161485
What?...	11.099823805993042
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	11.634789236457493
What?	14.626800461768257
Dignam dead?	29.650499200884784
— What about Dignam?	15.39633949707359
says Bob Doran.	13.19929730908105
Who ’ s talking about...?	14.923063539258754
— Dead! says Alf.	11.412745090452884
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	11.481132519376207
— Maybe so, says Joe.	11.332787798769521
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	9.198685994779678
— Paddy?	24.397689833016045
says Alf.	13.175221141786889
— Ay, says Joe.	8.220110769393216
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	9.204193694998914
— Good Christ! says Alf.	9.86977341896007
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	13.834206663624485
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	5.900972294678788
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	5.823146255519989
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	7.0642726613265445
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	8.236239455492917
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	6.139685454440353
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	6.645004524845628
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	6.469392977611454
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	8.023975142823915
Mind C.	23.33188235882017
K.	25.805990245550035
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	7.425870582565936
J.	9.522090257552765
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	8.211057293460897
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	8.492336224737297
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	7.701922031293702
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	9.659397668842159
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	8.378826492696069
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	8.60238463861482
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	9.113058111065465
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	11.371012026945186
— Who?	12.696584449771581
— Bloom, says he.	12.991565358550522
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	11.115331832948801
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	8.40210068931254
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	11.670766165277255
Faith, he was.	20.492734407356796
— Good Christ! says he.	11.269984237518665
I could have sworn it was him.	11.170244481224092
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	9.856700312141768
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	8.705737615408276
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	9.662532951936907
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	11.987945694976833
He ’ s over all his troubles.	13.023230631420475
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	11.411143600784726
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	10.610547264281438
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	9.449372378879993
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	9.232636194222232
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	10.20449485485441
Talking through his bloody hat.	15.27885723946324
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	7.533139236508673
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	9.316739824099106
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	11.182186366440597
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	8.425167971527298
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	9.08585583399407
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	11.1700083423433
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	8.525840993953283
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	10.033218353962276
Listen to this, will you?	15.474486269064181
And he starts reading out one.	11.346319464632995
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	6.604674104023532

— _...	9.869859724632455
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	9.0054709485438
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	7.08467942524206
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	9.093850846893332
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	8.24656068356011
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	14.05956890864508
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	11.068269243111443
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	8.383102138562785
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	9.430701244458946
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	8.77972687297037
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	7.517370351991014
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	7.702478447002283
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	5.772362940925102
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	8.369843690867686
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	8.778050660749601
— What ’ s that?	10.254129274625361
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	8.332762129116931
— That so?	13.356811734294967
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	11.36329400440267
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	9.358283144253864
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	10.847216651823876
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	10.462993802808914
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	9.803604919090906
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	9.779517387609276
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	8.913348849105953
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	5.930960686297705
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	11.190394859338955
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	7.4169905149348665
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	9.80262617506825
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	8.174422083336319
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	10.243478885792335
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	10.215866031060537
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	6.490519126862709
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	9.004855471719628
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	9.550787464394665
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	7.89396866030647
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	9.988915147231562
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	11.049433012766539
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	7.687663007970506
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	10.521275365017578
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	8.307198437365479
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	9.88639357100212
What I mean is...	13.223564668866864
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	9.62604218485223
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	7.847547958774281
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	9.097476001678812
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	5.426388587753502
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	6.182550482601283
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	4.831863850926234
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	5.3405373433788075
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	5.9062789420676065
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	5.769774433264252
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	5.140558963549577
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	4.685087778184176
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	2.73977735659847
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	6.009880907743602
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	7.823580802046719

as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	8.012301031008278
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	4.529152263364314
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	5.317456167647772
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	8.00865096953085
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	8.261684228534515

I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	8.377091264992194
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	6.192568620928772
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	6.28709102789689
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	6.467377543442714
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	5.9528888740793775
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	4.749489168114039
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	9.192801474360007
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	6.4251360348334305
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	6.391691275878847
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	6.303543128499944
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	5.473780607439819
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	4.881081835303204
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	5.620683577080075
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	5.724207228320416
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	6.33148197919399
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	6.213403147872076
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	6.136101458455066
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	8.023500738386003
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	6.852926313954668
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	8.515523437877194
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	6.1588791367069025
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	8.4064352790345
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	6.3246897651684035
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	5.921242006360661
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	6.280482955200433
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	7.631826682113033
Antitreating is about the size of it.	12.427268619470794
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	9.42961651578089
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	7.156836883253402
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	12.082976014188365
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	7.976412806271081
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	7.598416913995699
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	9.227279705700935
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	11.599653459064978
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	8.51977164046318
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	13.147807551336504
says the citizen, jeering.	12.233801674824132
— No, says I.	11.76068434456368
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	10.604245187844738
So he calls the old dog over.	14.676776527642913
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	12.550108746259113
says he.	14.955382316123046
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	9.083639306090166
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	10.353097088469092
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	7.8192618963949085
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	8.789510624552095
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	5.839397906130893
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	6.695054754532337
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	5.382738123275902
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	5.837256437421885
O.	16.60830871151788
C.	14.422967377726438
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	6.78749550718671
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	6.641823793698667
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	5.629597762249684
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	6.342108745184618
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	5.699519981133714
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	9.222583551121287
And Joe asked him would he have another.	13.190282514332718
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	10.076860888362202
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	11.637659846897586
Entertainment for man and beast.	13.650074944000941
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	10.729346527063312
— Could a swim duck?	11.282008283957415
says I.	14.93050077080704
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	9.654758297890233
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	12.266677183424203
says he.	14.955382316123046
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	13.369658121974783
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	9.389615981232588
Martin asked me to go to the house.	17.968355521689567
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	8.975664092144555
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	10.434425695497017
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	10.951532800332341
— Whose admirers?	15.03878021063283
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	10.845262217363455
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	8.92323093863561
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	8.95104382657155
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	7.2875124796902275
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	8.739686632412013
Choking with bloody foolery.	12.85091126219673
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	11.423161865309282
Shake hands, brother.	16.549874354822656
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	11.739348259428589
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	8.055789541077509
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	7.026206496341268
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	6.453083682941166
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	13.148263553990754
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	7.002631618850198
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	14.173311912782577
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	10.405744710443871
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	8.756500475018363
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	7.519713510664264
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	8.15491068864806
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	9.451175461376796
_How is your testament?	15.381000804433727
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	10.976997723977137
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	9.064495887580946
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	15.735312143634458
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	8.342294077816199
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	11.025141860543876
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	10.255412249406714
So Terry brought the three pints.	13.433392155404588
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	13.260579719501234
Here, citizen.	17.782200614524857
— _Slan leat_, says he.	9.746328640504002
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	10.232818850359404
Good health, citizen.	15.002866773020424
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	11.292962051852209
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	11.376670415596672
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	8.979798248755213
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	10.675935809899297
— Nannan?	21.419745075396328
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
The mimber?	20.306843475763657
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	9.541531496864138
— I thought so, says Joe.	11.198518642703968
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	9.727347572982488
P., the cattle traders.	12.574100448659042
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	8.036843659746033
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	7.175473750734955
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	10.08518099789868
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	8.77723505435572
Mister Knowall.	19.669709954004386
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	10.599172877496729
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	9.0285414162962
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	7.095089637481408
What ’ s your programme today?	13.046414406071964
Ay. Humane methods.	12.16443442722707
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	7.338484461646248
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	11.54840914992795
Klook Klook Klook.	12.983027203254506
Black Liz is our hen.	11.721817592677006
She lays eggs for us.	12.216351828254588
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	9.920259330454613
Gara.	43.61016457105117
Klook Klook Klook.	12.983027203254506
Then comes good uncle Leo.	11.055478096922444
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	8.807582666698757
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	8.437765945908433
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	11.695757978600744
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	16.542119503736096
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	11.2164374198612
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	11.115434614771074
I wanted particularly.	19.051653530000735
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	11.50430991213899
I couldn ’ t phone.	14.637053888545797
No. You ’ re sure?	15.183662572616038
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	11.127443752868967
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	7.983226846220642
What do you think of that, citizen?	16.0055683251216
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	8.438902854522379
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	8.409516949012508
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	6.914284759368592
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	11.609785637036788
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	8.984651640704463
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	9.420034654933916
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	9.33961536720881
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	9.325250878069262
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	7.206674645778724
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	6.462173192728893
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	10.597270971134849
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	11.02303464558444
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	11.768340021147264
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	6.681808609622525
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	11.738405401575186
There he is sitting there.	15.67499070928268
The man that got away James Stephens.	10.644735261491885
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	9.15970346551138
What was your best throw, citizen?	12.011839994665461
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	9.564303721428082
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	13.408961204613806
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	10.270534027761563
You were and a bloody sight better.	12.677023962268212
— Is that really a fact?	11.542716031073953
says Alf.	13.175221141786889
— Yes, says Bloom.	10.381425946729069
Did you not know that?	17.527854698298786
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	6.842424964676076
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	8.32402106814613
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	9.355162629492941
Do you see that straw?	15.623014504311628
That ’ s a straw_.	12.452130056762666
Declare to my aunt he ’ d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	11.924527570754702
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	5.869869254173828
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	8.949387625392749
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	5.887421510161271
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	5.911540095034545

Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	5.236369260397224
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	6.090986158667846
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	6.263255070610308

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	9.279096868710578
— No, says Joe.	9.994697505020197
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	9.102583205461091
— Who?	12.696584449771581
Blazes?	50.57076679477979
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	9.718234093570878
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	9.884593967271828
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	8.848320907493225
— We know him, says the citizen.	11.519096171844616
The traitor ’ s son.	12.960973787133483

And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	8.147848568978452
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	11.13417318758416

See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	10.068048319274062
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	9.59856507537296
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	5.708486533335895
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	8.088573054916331
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	7.2446783739740965
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	5.637978006984867
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	7.236908236249125
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	8.228336965355076
The men came to handigrips.	12.120440051862543
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	6.752919001143175
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	6.292129882340573
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	10.439300832476325
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	6.78786145307163
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	5.738583193091902
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	6.252771399779691
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	5.0334365280867575
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	7.579144669813064

J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	8.544082885719098
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	9.657236036802884
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	14.36034920685474
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	11.231881588966196
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	10.939344258071168

And who was he, tell us?	16.995681196410846
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	8.281654756130063
— And moreover, says J.	9.406103363320419

And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	9.304237227641705
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	9.38098173436993

J.	9.522090257552765
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	6.838778471630457
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	12.04973301996433
Course it was a bloody barney.	16.404313689016515
What?	14.626800461768257
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	8.911140900865451
J.	9.522090257552765
J.	9.522090257552765
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	8.045430696876412
— Who tried the case?	13.502238960966526
says Joe.	10.127827565684312

— Ay, says Alf.	9.190647300344295
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	8.287454070482461
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	9.053149344538069
Ten, did you say?	19.05012337415492
— Yes, your worship.	11.808982869104561
And my wife has the typhoid.	13.203513094874124
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	6.628491492825004
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	12.143180306535328
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	9.79263856758755
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	7.497698920762525
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	5.905593087406688
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	7.977195327816219
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	8.682015801681072
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	7.86238513557852
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	6.946966780736598
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	8.74374281537852
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	6.419801307411321
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	7.566257155634771
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	8.949875802813303
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	9.094864229558565
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	10.749288635350862
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	12.667631005266967
That ’ s the whole secret.	13.186650264278262
— Rely on me, says Joe.	10.622346049829394
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	11.057859574417165
We want no more strangers in our house.	10.740140238148406
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	11.496792449631396
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	10.709539142753421
— Consider that done, says Joe.	9.671105789654465
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	13.15999547704824
— The strangers, says the citizen.	9.744150735847631
Our own fault.	18.815261996256297
We let them come in.	15.007789426332621
We brought them in.	17.774840455964988
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	7.977722486799917
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	9.43568864127131
J.	9.522090257552765
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	9.553630513239785
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	11.839396156846044
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	9.53350687021505
— Give us a squint at her, says I.	10.961403486287018

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	9.138229391484778
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	9.492924250204577
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	10.489247679813822
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	7.929128819541613
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	6.769135576327642
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	9.430849924759023
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	8.5691079874939
J.	9.522090257552765
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	6.7578488407921595
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	9.371638621650154
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	7.762101584956293
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	9.706263247057416
Tonguetied sons of bastards ’ ghosts.	9.712439417282964
— The European family, says J.	9.768497482392224
J....	9.846166523025525
— They ’ re not European, says the citizen.	9.000319310570529
I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	8.792669683201948
You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	7.511301672876715
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	5.761202206742295
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	13.608454510876657
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	11.586125577348257
— Gold cup, says he.	13.168670634175305
— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	12.689398929037944
says Terry.	21.076330882580102
_ — Throwaway, _ says he, at twenty to one.	12.043575273417025
A rank outsider.	17.504170273426073
And the rest nowhere.	15.57786892719581

_Throwaway, _ says he.	15.131190809433546

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	4.983896667658524
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	4.058508392697378
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	5.427442396505582
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	5.375926261547943
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	6.399933790481766
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	4.373174138549565
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	7.041790653802806
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	9.023694483759824
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	6.2077195004368475
— And will again, says Joe.	10.164178763096464
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	9.926338333491094
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	5.682583265953411
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	7.248678425714564
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	12.335900467589465

What will you have?	20.13126219841391
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	8.83935123256564
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	11.275009805447846
Terry! Are you asleep?	15.251256893630988
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	10.756301942632236
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	9.847234300631857
Right, sir.	15.338842689567798
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public.	8.073849637673849

Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	9.721897532810713
— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	8.803180743788342
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	10.37630939335682
Hell upon earth it is.	13.334842812052155
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	8.45122449818713
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	7.185757377368808
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	6.9337108948199555
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	7.911077313803659
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	7.625607995492143
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	8.050958242904416
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	8.669203837392688
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	9.042572248835988
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	6.798085733028389
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	10.170905655034385
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	11.410678712699783
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	10.247114011754563
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	6.180402616938449
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	11.23528978162346
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	11.162577489841501
Didn ’ t I tell you?	15.912466972112705
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	9.593114251243609
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	8.438626189870467
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	9.78692409834048
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	10.468974488064326
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	5.659876533529682
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	7.940864930302763
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	6.2217577088114036
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	10.970882781406567
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	10.586208901525842
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	12.332896521725969
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	7.469772865811303
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	12.49977267977369
But my point was...	13.091821018830359
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	11.94597919937942
— Ay, says John Wyse.	9.859238780850859
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	6.627157031406573
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	10.76533551810012
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	7.953262563936515
Fontenoy, eh?	15.38048730055059
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	5.953361697910659
But what did we ever get for it?	12.512027968909628
— The French! says the citizen.	10.05275929058321
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	12.420688875011848
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	8.757554323372132
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	7.558391052639029
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	7.330591307788609
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	7.553335772425754
— Well, says J.	9.94624344225477

We have Edward the peacemaker now.	9.591384061333896
— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	10.595429199760224
Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	7.947525304537726
The earl of Dublin, no less.	15.794905143944344
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	10.609795431756808
And says J.	13.912349970363115
J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	6.772979362114715
— Will you try another, citizen?	12.575227492284135
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Yes, sir, says he.	10.060020963387975
I will.	18.45052472787935
— You?	21.455025548644166
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	11.514537013713904
May your shadow never grow less.	11.255425841067565
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	8.210349526092017
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	12.39542935485987
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	10.498028174351836
— But do you know what a nation means?	13.622321992953017
says John Wyse.	14.03584931832622
— Yes, says Bloom.	10.381425946729069
— What is it?	10.27386930003328
says John Wyse.	14.03584931832622
— A nation?	18.650721025873768
says Bloom.	17.01668186353096
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	12.418354620325523
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	12.751590690466616
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	10.248003040196583
— What is your nation if I may ask?	10.863060640222692
says the citizen.	10.254648487785271
— Ireland, says Bloom.	15.104046399545064
Ireland.	35.01885359770475
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	8.296285378562764
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	10.06573855299711
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	10.312853246979166
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	11.062770221601587
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	4.580225926594784
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	6.303321815358335
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	5.296345974381235
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	4.853417731298549
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	6.127801748797258
— Show us over the drink, says I.	10.836167300352374
Which is which?	19.12938901064311
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	13.002246622298355
Also now.	23.00825715136916
This very moment.	17.31295126896695
This very instant.	17.689674500550463
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	10.37540568008414
— Robbed, says he.	11.896192761910397
Plundered.	44.80800061837366
Insulted.	44.80800061837366
Persecuted.	44.80800061837366
Taking what belongs to us by right.	11.260338596956846
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	8.55475898364659
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	12.148907343007908
says the citizen.	10.254648487785271
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	8.65448614930215
— Right, says John Wyse.	11.531162331213304
Stand up to it then with force like men.	12.139127755668028
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	9.461198852740058
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	11.949391486098497
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	11.655371115350281
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	9.542358526923312
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	8.972446370069173
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	12.955665533251237
Force, hatred, history, all that.	11.367067958215456
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	9.232173256089299
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	12.16331547497049
— What?	11.791741423260737
says Alf.	13.175221141786889
— Love, says Bloom.	14.45099636712074
I mean the opposite of hatred.	11.309937435235003
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	12.90070509806634
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	13.967083402746761
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	13.634295432762743
Just a moment.	15.317530734177378
Who ’ s hindering you?	11.913230622341791
And off he pops like greased lightning.	7.846241845404176
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	8.111688981637057
Universal love.	25.808264237065412
— Well, says John Wyse.	10.681262316498957
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	13.370545399680003
Love your neighbour.	17.404687229677045
— That chap?	17.85237012263906
says the citizen.	10.254648487785271
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	11.87819485636782
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	9.009155778201848
Love loves to love love.	13.257536169506368
Nurse loves the new chemist.	14.678667508245626
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	10.84588671458695
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	12.24361650387432
M.	18.390364149614893
B.	17.770077165899938
loves a fair gentleman.	18.893947727128072
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	7.006599643847017
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	11.451120563335884
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	9.189898916228783
Mrs Norman W.	14.132581409086685
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	11.517273315885836
You love a certain person.	15.313281649431252
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	7.392641970289018
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	10.77984913796992
More power, citizen.	14.165522021058477
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	12.067855136791822
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	8.865073231415806
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	8.327557483375152
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	6.263347852047362
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	6.912033802140637
— What ’ s that?	10.254129274625361
says Joe.	10.127827565684312
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	6.027788446037154
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	6.367872270392229
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	5.166737526325947
— Widow woman, says Ned.	12.882823714273277
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	13.062659436416604
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	11.388977702861089
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	11.949130526760744
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	6.126700418704068
— Is that by Griffith?	12.7780233200851
says John Wyse.	14.03584931832622
— No, says the citizen.	9.54832402571131
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	10.836786044928981
It ’ s only initialled: P.	9.424637886868167
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	10.169869845088613
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	9.140141910441065
Trade follows the flag.	14.046489549555432
— Well, says J.	9.94624344225477
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	7.766550406006323
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	12.780091257739816
— Casement, says the citizen.	9.753050951206047
He ’ s an Irishman.	13.89990810245318
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	11.926327272857492
J.	9.522090257552765
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	8.244814874429297
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	11.24012644123717
— Who?	12.696584449771581
says I.	14.93050077080704
— Bloom, says he.	12.991565358550522
The courthouse is a blind.	14.192713854114496
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	9.636514831423646
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	9.209274273524063
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	9.918395594640405
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	11.350994464700392
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	11.319699562430513
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	11.983740679660416
A dark horse.	18.069896288524355
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	10.27998382178176
— Mind, Joe, says I.	10.848619069566682
Show us the entrance out.	14.290976919141636
— There you are, says Terry.	13.519013170034667
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	12.699027619451416
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	7.067467746898002
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	6.848066044096854
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	13.140823853547323
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	7.621923692024215
Give us a bloody chance.	14.776521416926125
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	10.618484273648457
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	10.068411329478556
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	6.67650738274573
Loans by post on easy terms.	10.980417024867114
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	9.890337154004833
Distance no object.	18.25076273918291
No security.	23.447519910359688
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	9.002346842732406
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	11.54109489649494
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	14.693376216847923
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	7.410398471414201
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	6.671104403740624
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	8.759025631063654
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	7.587539217643478
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	8.631216195565433
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	9.871142871072307
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	8.592880633600977
Look to our steeds.	15.224112395654242
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	9.643278628345316
I know not what to offer your lordships.	10.850677923790084
— How now, fellow?	15.065933951606976
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	8.5553292196185
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	7.59203651152759
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	10.120403025446096
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	8.596431505608813
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	7.7589817020687075
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	8.473703675791093
Hast aught to give us?	15.803568762782753
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	6.22388423090703
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	11.413196038024111
That likes me well.	15.18740473563047
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	11.068873896539797
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	7.981049292062556
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	9.909766510476569
— Where is he?	14.323881018328876
says Lenehan.	21.961057783939445
Defrauding widows and orphans.	11.965405618177451
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	10.801362845295905
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	12.811664219755606
Or so they allege.	13.627047592433927
— I, says Joe.	9.37926893774263
I ’ m the alligator.	10.25389027012521
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	10.918075233410635
— Why not?	15.905669486831524
says J.	15.01607110375233
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	8.998696207062805
says Ned.	18.77199419850152
Or who is he?	19.089295076616892
No offence, Crofton.	13.911509754372021
— Who is Junius?	12.031917911731512
says J.	15.01607110375233
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	8.956968919875031
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	10.298602968386872
We know that in the castle.	17.148706150712034
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	10.951322603331167
says Jack Power.	19.753566226359666
— Not at all, says Martin.	14.287753350271455
Only namesakes.	20.534055874555403
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	12.121382233585743
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	12.390883276193685
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	8.838766413430124
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	10.001015264081055
For that matter so are we.	12.856137766788963
— Yes, says J.	8.869805232121058
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	10.003577994018599
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	10.998296525270252
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	9.88536060804934
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	10.25742077123291
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	7.774709689342281
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	6.718466860450743
J.	9.522090257552765
— Do you call that a man?	15.365053359228428
says the citizen.	10.254648487785271
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	11.04060776137389
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	10.099306970640137
— And who does he suspect?	12.107347369860234
says the citizen.	10.254648487785271
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	10.046168577281062
One of those mixed middlings he is.	10.180532601530164
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	8.932928715862332
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	12.070653944346072
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	11.853574104782123
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	9.76016331652146
Give us your blessing.	15.787968633466397
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	10.823242257473183
But where is he?	17.91925659783534
We can ’ t wait.	16.067673122895567
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	8.050568767177538
That ’ s what he is.	13.532239890345792
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	8.89145014080738
Cursed by God.	19.396609025104013
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	11.268480915345563
says Ned.	18.77199419850152
— Only one, says Martin.	15.586809070724128
We must be quick.	15.145488854848448

Three half ones, Terry.	13.409839770965347
— Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	7.586652218112334
— Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	9.892043291794446
God bless all here is my prayer.	12.325522747037825
— Amen, says the citizen.	10.54125823379534
— And I ’ m sure He will, says Joe.	11.036068771548045
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	4.883469294692001

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.	11.52906310181221
And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	4.034649953814646
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	4.88110121043874
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	7.415870195303807
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	5.835858507534497
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	8.68149666315894
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	4.309656681900002
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	9.690598881698715
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	12.01614969742557
And butter for fish.	13.840679900509407
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	9.093854144346247
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	11.662470597155023
I hope I ’ m not...	13.362322991931748
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	13.539051014139908
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	11.231258953435006
Mean bloody scut.	14.571994388763326
Stand us a drink itself.	16.299069206180814
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	11.639126062182461
Cute as a shithouse rat.	11.68499348550064
Hundred to five.	17.12278493605872
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	8.758844813729993
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	11.651286177716594
Come along now.	17.46552320341832
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	8.501804505590515
It ’ s a secret.	14.936122768702015
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	10.564655255059966
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	11.655845650678256
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	10.842831485198893
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	14.181891819869291
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	6.128668763551248
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	5.894119511144017
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	9.16540919529288
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	8.2010560256124
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	7.845466472783849
— Let me alone, says he.	12.158006975424168
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	8.672484689456933
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	9.557544787817191
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	11.327103226107948
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	7.766849670609105
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	12.78309258465278
Your God.	24.066026483552093
— He had no father, says Martin.	13.57014249683945
That ’ ll do now.	13.788176990997083
Drive ahead.	21.997649906996827
— Whose God?	16.04678787507832
says the citizen.	10.254648487785271
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	10.261850165311309
Your God was a jew.	15.352485348350736
Christ was a jew like me.	17.161801563399724
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	10.068065304196969
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	10.142518887864577
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	13.738409993203998
Give us that biscuitbox here.	9.962274920960692
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	11.02067668801098
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	7.319760602383859
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	6.025821427075805
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	5.493622743675548
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	4.967393269986124
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	5.483787937419387
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	6.752001222119927
And Ned and J.	12.23985576437027
J.	9.522090257552765
paralysed with the laughing.	18.581206990076033
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	13.171365661227414
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	10.585158342343103
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	10.504266453447208
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	10.205866777701168
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	14.278485842361423
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	10.897262191450922
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	8.393181872002858
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	8.573123886345833
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	6.78725677008535
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	5.990568494790315
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	7.087769514062424
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	5.40983495225131
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	5.753867011660671
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	5.054571424076897
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	5.739978331541844
The work of salvage, removal of _débris, _ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, <NUM> Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	5.839400178260633

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he ’ d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	8.457266352762662
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	8.12517682516863
What?	14.626800461768257
O, Jesus, he did.	17.150956415786975
And he let a volley of oaths after him.	9.235240767417896
— Did I kill him, says he, or what?	13.234939661907113
And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	8.24932463386412
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	11.835537886114505
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	8.357396593943825
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	7.138431116552308
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	6.690102816875517
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	7.940345638310722
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	7.003507613859214
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	8.396136326098066
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	6.92837367020656
M.	18.390364149614893
S.	16.571640904015453
Belleisle_ printed on both.	16.787101696878988
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	6.508626637372322
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	7.11456056235007
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	6.688899755259062
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	8.05901855906236
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	8.529403160157084
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	10.298365923403711
Say out big, big.	15.193942099411485
I want a drink of water.	14.099650611864782
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	8.345036769396463
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	6.873591185023062
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	8.410867100393093
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	7.686928785517747
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	7.734571063935846
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	9.038133946621477
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	10.883157285984751
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	9.135784646476418
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	7.4999674519963255
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	6.560746318248604
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	9.986535416666367
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	9.151756014173356
Wait till I catch you for that.	12.411848607021943
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	7.003078856555569
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	10.63808761975635
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	6.957121959656573
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	8.247098308925777
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	9.784505277978994
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	9.626669535071267
Butter and cream?	21.037506873307574
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	14.237466160597588
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	7.817257786493074
Cissy queried.	25.26111825046501
— Nao, Tommy said.	9.521209918340292
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	7.581635274390951
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	11.335191748994447
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	11.8311468682714
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	9.359157037177765
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	8.43519001235817
But who was Gerty?	19.217618864310996
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	7.4147258818536566
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	8.32246417241365
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	6.425446103446727
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	6.0287216145349625
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	6.960022678453222
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	8.967598580475178
No. Honour where honour is due.	9.317040356359854
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	5.779921818202721
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	6.890366781202065
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	7.599392665354811
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	9.617402308784744
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	7.504052599260272
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	8.564292881704132
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	6.474724440338956
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	7.769858323676678
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	11.241567931100358
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	8.220051622211045
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	10.54080740019524
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	7.208481604453645
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	6.983136349014516
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	9.316846951882374
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	9.357515694879512
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	10.739048274807827
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	8.39267174392664
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	9.100436479044513
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	9.018098024352435
E.	17.819059343782875
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	8.86438784789871
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	7.411286483257574
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	10.58446581281072
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	8.750619052765698
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	9.091734912792703
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	8.477054415058102
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	5.92603220981855
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	6.069024884794683
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	7.232381084369892
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	9.418854891974528
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	6.324401493449487
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	5.848469873837202
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	7.511295475198355
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	6.183841035728069
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	8.449884756137559
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	8.916062751815428
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	9.32075455219765
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	12.904030649360845
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	10.449582183307507
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	7.374977228853877
C.	14.422967377726438
D.	18.46135330716019
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	6.881214289871504
He was too young to understand.	14.104716754154786
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	13.803275432758566
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	8.915804696126417
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	9.164427067468656
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	7.57407764097158
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	10.20991957697515
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	7.582854624547063
It would be like heaven.	15.373496375145706
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	8.172233742329047
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	8.03728359838094
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	8.954961349528928
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	8.964459905176223
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	7.244998345724061
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	5.925396344446218
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	9.657217329696612
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	10.039960222219738
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	11.26947482231702
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	13.314217345656719
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	8.89530445995594
It ’ s my ball.	13.702087507502032
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	8.791187867383025
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	10.78675476334505
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	7.575719520864743
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	8.086971964421776
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	12.35392986208364
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	8.367850099552859
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	8.075796448039036
But not a pin cared Ciss.	11.76049489889812
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	9.528861158105382
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	14.536922176125753
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	10.20133921971973
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	14.284337395443794
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	8.058924790006714
That was just like Cissycums.	14.309481271180527
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	8.917253451580475
There was none to come up to her for fun.	14.413647076265123
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	8.21011715677052
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	9.276373985146467
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	7.571664318352245
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	6.920314580413562
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	6.818398933272468
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	6.353184844501857
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	7.612483214140623
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	6.073452758414375
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	8.590151800243145
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	6.9462135124523
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	7.636487540502505
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	9.135602784681986
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	6.760472502772547
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	8.373976676068864
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	11.536224849687954
Now he was laid to rest.	12.670878801295224
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	8.128021160965963
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	8.591114294693561
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	7.4088673618523
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	13.254034650976454
You could see there was a story behind it.	13.63515815533121
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	8.736401343873924
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	7.252895955881215
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	6.907747791621773
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	6.778999528162596
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	7.574134498693133
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	8.834394886717046
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	8.876089812998837
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	9.119307193120036
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	10.817275771474518
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	7.819175234153742
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	6.838969152254755
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	7.1063418802169735
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	6.28019676246536
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	7.335600757094069
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	9.221810930892959
— Say papa, baby.	12.46364917856755
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	6.845252098316577
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	9.233235563546165
— Haja ja ja haja.	7.734508833674419
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	7.586395993881237
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	7.6873996350040175
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	7.152902464504386
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	9.615783170579853
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	12.12290027297691
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	9.272740427614675
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	13.767011649785967
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	8.221086836047094
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	9.263719745854642
People were so queer.	16.867315708477026
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	7.724033713800842
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	10.883221242752317
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	12.73058960334342
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	9.164305163956177
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	9.321488514554488
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	15.18303271696876
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	10.374918390715013
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	8.808956295126654
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	8.305926347884787
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	7.9274635072453945
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	8.247815183985127
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	8.700601810709895
Refuge of sinners.	14.578180879128338
Comfortress of the afflicted.	16.524177132194346
_Ora pro nobis_.	14.863468133765018
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	6.918176238009987
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	7.957350151963111
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	7.5884984111944975
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	9.615005323025805
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	7.9051527469440686
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	8.125801330743354
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	10.873225295399847
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	10.690269214238784
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	10.381583747817723
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	10.220560154548
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	8.916580460200601
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	9.118781317113326
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	7.839353432079163
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	11.241416637591254
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	7.70921771292926
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	8.635595231061714
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	8.381443514309904
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	7.439092266480944
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	9.444487990687506
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	8.474004125134815
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	8.316721236145703
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	8.758069082458922
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	8.860622649498572
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	8.137673724866541
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	9.875969296672837
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	11.995733217671457
— What?	11.791741423260737
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	9.227195739660376
I was only wondering was it late.	12.061437366906578
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	8.505859016341903
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	9.713419116068412
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	13.100849422350523
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	10.591761898876342
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	10.36797884108757
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	10.66493272149134
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	8.53023686277071
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	9.847491919938387
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	8.1281039744451
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	9.51695095063893
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	8.451487036160694
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	12.035640947888979
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	9.562775978349116
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	7.1613256049394325
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	10.241271658988056
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	13.325948107339327
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	7.9719168754434495
Gerty winced sharply.	14.540661486306448
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	7.504056064632513
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	7.9427266588342915
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	6.947223243000701
She had loved him better than he knew.	12.69902118518034
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	9.712212352936694
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	7.258457419616914
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	9.297668084005501
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	9.350406883844048
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	7.071699306637561
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	11.349267643574445
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	8.324358413460876
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	8.59589842690582
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	8.064033170895035
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	8.485476034997413
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	7.305917523182148
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	6.990126482304175
He has his bib destroyed.	11.33155971543744
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	7.223194707077972
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	7.655666989628228
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	7.478172898940727
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	6.369564164239429
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	10.724463525808565
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	7.12045576519308
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	6.69606866425389
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	7.094801752188896
But it must end, she felt.	14.193365840223985
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	10.130486032242136
Love laughs at locksmiths.	12.050173622802236
She would make the great sacrifice.	14.39213574781617
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	9.624013780665138
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	9.897165268650163
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	8.763678380803295
But even if — what then?	12.290325547194724
Would it make a very great difference?	13.366005962486309
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	7.7192457232922855
No, no: not that.	15.526671206279273
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	8.01211655454331
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	11.048213326725831
She thought she understood.	15.865351449603548
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	10.500215904117844
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	8.583184581615898
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	10.96172794600386
Nothing else mattered.	16.070219827639395
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	9.497738440643941
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	7.774183281852883
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	9.137718742477658
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	8.915232100199724
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	12.08943772988336
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	12.022998788577423
But Gerty was adamant.	13.282869944058449
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	9.383796066274552
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	9.94978765204559
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	8.05430300513989
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	11.294920072928631
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	11.63253112225781
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	7.9097254193887
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	9.024835993533447
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	7.811565887983972
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	9.630321742063483
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	8.44667701459528
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	9.95664363152849
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	8.042517808550025
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	8.296199957390478
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	7.279448162206722
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	7.783215604368235
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	11.125819327933737
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	9.06029335467203
What a brute he had been! At it again?	11.374917429504357
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	10.61646399894466
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	8.928347791547424
Should a girl tell?	17.06874137552806
No, a thousand times no.	11.15372959819278
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	7.8932952125924025
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	8.795219236277347
Come on.	18.31575871878564
We can see from farther up.	13.361299500977907
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	14.224060134717002
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	8.42825259298093
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	15.64104651687705
She rose.	22.337563813748325
Was it goodbye?	18.09814972199836
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	10.6854529644126
She drew herself up to her full height.	12.941164760120378
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	7.9709175170572335
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	8.39966642813359
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	8.950601065500209
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	8.411272525742293
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	8.779143196889725
Tight boots?	24.889857992969457
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	10.40554740689185
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	10.32432264278672
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	11.087389707451564
Jilted beauty.	23.573792789616896
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	9.83473142573188
But makes them polite.	14.913693358162655
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	13.856021113366506
Hot little devil all the same.	13.108401661381734
I wouldn ’ t mind.	15.20930834611373
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	10.365539080722769
That squinty one is delicate.	12.907683215991682
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	8.699265216408035
I have such a bad headache today.	11.168567266925182
Where did I put the letter?	17.02535091331194
Yes, all right.	15.714565430117942
All kinds of crazy longings.	10.048383468379402
Licking pennies.	22.35666060299863
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	7.618142872855921
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	13.568790062628214
How many women in Dublin have it today?	12.035256201909325
Martha, she.	23.461155667060922
Something in the air.	15.660190984010976
That ’ s the moon.	13.17306644519756
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	10.72828535948241
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	11.993293018582696
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	9.47713430924843
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	13.043137124786929
Anyhow I got the best of that.	15.927538181577146
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	10.214214736240926
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	11.734958576129188
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	11.058632425658926
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	9.454890068666966
Thankful for small mercies.	11.898708096830855
Yours for the asking.	18.823345017969626
Because they want it themselves.	15.383609459890849
Their natural craving.	15.021467016236322
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	9.792213716888464
Reserve better.	23.528909592513717
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	12.19639131030775
Catch em alive, O.	13.107540096776553
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	15.897066246139532
A dream of wellfilled hose.	10.759167672103525
Where was that?	20.285931678906408
Ah, yes.	13.771021671461163
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	10.000843472633031
Peeping Tom.	23.35671473172802
Willy ’ s hat and what the girls did with it.	13.439495405370923
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	10.372890630148724
_Lingerie_ does it.	17.681249319453322
Felt for the curves inside her <URL> Excites them also when they ’ re.	9.198048146645508
I ’ m all clean come and dirty me.	8.967207016606485
Milly delighted with Molly ’ s new blouse.	12.419561953201843
At first.	24.014894434193305
Put them all on to take them all off.	15.495898904722072
Molly.	27.93506674744532
Why I bought her the violet garters.	11.870796980840248
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	8.779348242207453
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	10.015161758891757
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	9.23221977416201
of jet.	10.631004009623565
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	8.612006095852065
Pinned together.	23.27425267287941
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	9.469179542020555
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	12.480712628911768
Fashion part of their charm.	15.889477049876522
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	11.83270784000934
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	10.222281427301573
No reasonable offer refused.	11.318660772815287
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	12.767466819150577
Always off to a fellow when they are.	15.27340292940619
They never forget an appointment.	12.329373683616353
Out on spec probably.	11.226365127570151
They believe in chance because like themselves.	9.975014315041726
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	10.581412243990584
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	7.44714645314942
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	8.512321100785433
Barbed wire.	21.773607227684202
Be sure now and write to me.	12.9390470998116
Now won ’ t you?	15.549158651748074
Molly and Josie Powell.	13.900560049940955
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	9.812441889163228
_Tableau! _ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	14.314943363281326
What have you been doing with yourself?	10.876619123704424
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	11.919564894982827
Picking holes in each other ’ s appearance.	11.878499132926411
You ’ re looking splendid.	10.796329391555924
Sister souls.	24.84611346617401
Showing their teeth at one another.	12.079727245471792
How many have you left?	15.556813861690559
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	9.630610600507422
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	11.118532682938476
Dark devilish appearance.	13.858873419548614
Scratch the sole of my foot.	13.841351959334473
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	11.46553662467625
Good to rest once in a way.	13.561590912595921
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	13.929785333276959
Safe in one way.	17.656256933158204
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	11.408421379959332
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	9.879670569564665
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	10.21275561787302
Daresay she felt I.	17.34545244766759
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	11.531473040058371
Liked me or what?	17.31867217408059
Dress they look at.	17.203186193194316
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	7.5862050925901165
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	10.638778372647138
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	7.780022178850186
Trousers?	48.550635089658606
Suppose I when I was?	18.179157350372158
No. Gently does it.	10.92911956238801
Dislike rough and tumble.	12.245641500058959
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	16.35381432274061
Saw something in me.	17.91930598151204
Wonder what.	22.1599621099652
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	6.519554220728621
To aid gentleman in literary.	12.13764038010929
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	9.16040085103559
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	12.669214788924563
Still, you never know.	16.352844540434607
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	10.411579174935664
Beauty and the beast.	15.440548990681474
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	14.000681674850645
Wide brim.	22.85014878345074
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	8.316455156668187
Hair strong in rut.	13.690314090507309
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	10.368662937938156
Why not?	18.018592647417044
Suppose he gave her money.	15.5652960379972
Why not?	18.018592647417044
All a prejudice.	13.65094869322151
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	11.865148066894962
What?	14.626800461768257
I think so.	18.750768538373585
All that for nothing.	16.59886832802408
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	12.465927688607692
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	10.004465519024029
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	10.75248588310371
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	12.495828137451225
No, I remember.	16.674220237414463
Richie Goulding: he ’ s another.	14.913666804358769
Weighs on his mind.	18.605667724675783
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	10.577891558640262
Dust.	43.051840588071244
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	9.192546695530313
Could do it myself.	17.443611969366035
Save.	36.20488112683466
Was that just when he, she?	15.297040504696035
O, he did.	17.757143453128602
Into her.	25.313483244794476
She did.	22.534781863965623
Done.	33.24417379825491
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	9.391894446865805
O Lord, that little limping devil.	12.455909746087656
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	11.67507953797735
Aftereffect not pleasant.	17.284634713185856
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	13.829228577389415
They don ’ t care.	14.39006436329141
Complimented perhaps.	22.219531345123368
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	7.496962875562345
Well, aren ’ t they?	13.659134279348985
See her as she is spoil all.	13.991956412078945
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	8.086337294625206
The name too.	17.362204931827407
_Amours_ of actresses.	15.658842356931187

Moonlight silver effulgence.	16.05755838006977
Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	11.627181534172633
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	13.027406124362729
Still, I feel.	18.783964196192635
The strength it gives a man.	12.013532701666808
That ’ s the secret of it.	12.703504798530833
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	10.82556426791491
Cider that was.	20.84397982999786
Otherwise I couldn ’ t have.	15.47594654959894
Makes you want to sing after.	16.29574285194353
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	12.002269938960216
Suppose I spoke to her.	15.5727903603693
What about?	24.667621756227042
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	10.581300541870547
Ask them a question they ask you another.	12.73149037794634
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	15.340477402087881
Gain time.	23.12292336724621
But then you ’ re in a cart.	13.311702864899141
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	8.136100716871967
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	9.712151865393423
All the dirty things I made her say.	12.274103253142824
All wrong of course.	15.618668847272264
My arks she called it.	11.719791505552688
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	12.305938057440706
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	9.229003356929127
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	11.380988782527645
Parrots.	44.80800061837366
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	11.795985399547972
Taking a man from another woman.	13.863719871928229
Or even hear of it.	13.10300231299399
Different with me.	18.866889628179333
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	12.764734399369246
Eating off his cold plate.	14.458494977640449
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	7.690810087245424
French letter still in my pocketbook.	13.970950630794466
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	10.145900679008877
Come in, all is prepared.	16.634515910506263
I dreamt.	24.142582449955242
What?	14.626800461768257
Worst is beginning.	17.82422327177451
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	12.240790747692719
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	10.652913492337552
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	10.794460070829572
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	11.943281313653662
Because I did.	19.710691997671212
She too.	22.53350472803903
Offend her.	24.39348522285047
Then make it up.	17.35356925070188
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	8.996088439763849
Flatters them.	23.564602268454635
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	11.398024027576858
What harm?	24.614016105502834
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	13.74304745135748
First kiss does the trick.	11.936362605418351
The propitious moment.	15.369642284646092
Something inside them goes pop.	11.29612045687549
First thoughts are best.	13.799801112264385
Remember that till their dying day.	10.979331636160076
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	8.010529786725552
But her breasts were developed.	10.11155767259355
Fell asleep then.	18.371883006908416
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	11.50781218145392
Featherbed mountain.	25.375036336690624
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	13.07415564975108
Val Dillon.	25.066725636107105
Apoplectic.	44.80800061837366
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	15.137765077833619
My fireworks.	23.470742958651403
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	12.265807187224285
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	10.515786211822816
Want to be grownups.	14.236627511304283
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	13.742768981570338
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	10.429239369359458
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	9.771187823700838
I knew she could whistle.	15.117599038262593
Mouth made for that.	18.23643599940005
Like Molly.	23.84367885846146
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	12.511547389482013
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	10.811170156514804
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	6.838617419329643
Caressing the little boy too.	15.405546537991658
Onlookers see most of the game.	12.286099349772774
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	8.77407068757765
In their line.	17.020322397896273
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	13.54021376596225
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	13.049916572495203
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	9.410817785998674
Fine eyes she had, clear.	14.618416121287446
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	10.670309832790727
Did she know what I?	17.54230698646336
Course.	40.22421663245653
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	10.355028669233313
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	8.046692070662077
Call that innocence?	15.88935878873494
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	10.693505827499374
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	8.613138887030376
Eyes all over them.	18.047329233966725
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	15.618133948195126
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	12.35695636630465
Sharp as needles they are.	12.239721240027022
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	9.476348858509363
Had, too.	16.21543093967714
Where do they get that?	17.13256589209571
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	8.80034619285763
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	11.858797396035923
Bred in the bone.	16.300991771592763
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	8.807685778023268
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	13.438416353555567
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	7.742884532182765
I never told her.	16.976433496026676
Attract men, small thing like that.	12.600651851785223
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	12.887313200747469
Who did you learn that from?	15.985810795299427
Nobody.	34.83935691677003
Something the nurse taught me.	11.544312843369537
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	8.982636618676572
Me have a nice pace.	16.89858328553812
Mullingar.	34.226276693969254
Who knows?	21.314446453094185
Ways of the world.	17.019897177179068
Young student.	17.447519706190963
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	12.059355146496916
Still she was game.	15.59538046253843
Lord, I am wet.	20.48709536172231
Devil you are.	20.064973023557716
Swell of her calf.	16.366640042173856
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	10.45236826888699
Not like that frump today.	10.666222348104657
A.	12.93983968749198
E.	17.819059343782875
Rumpled stockings.	20.961944866627935
Or the one in Grafton street.	12.85935088966855
White.	39.559417830785925
Wow! Beef to the heel.	11.589220222946347
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	8.160522756696148
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	9.1724274841938
Will she?	26.473393449621934
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	9.30263582106785
She smelt an onion.	12.413404804957798
Darling, I saw, your.	20.257043078801026
I saw all.	18.903572282253364
Lord! Did me good all the same.	11.919610421447851
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	11.501328652590638
For this relief much thanks.	9.894479639358387
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	14.28841570521206
Lord! It was all things combined.	15.763033507949583
Excitement.	44.80800061837366
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	9.208777701480052
Your head it simply swirls.	10.221418655713489
He ’ s right.	12.810266261253695
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	10.591000756121478
Instead of talking about nothing.	14.345624470710373
Then I will tell you all.	12.703766512081144
Still it was a kind of language between us.	14.808201271170795
It couldn ’ t be?	18.794041663401693
No, Gerty they called her.	13.9704395515247
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	8.446116068384981
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	8.922866536946826
Place made me think of that I suppose.	17.134642322776738
All tarred with the same brush.	13.356299146616847
Wiping pens in their stockings.	12.803652543235513
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	13.256685924551268
Every bullet has its billet.	10.544139313130989
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	10.196091536640292
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	10.980984629559662
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	7.1828159598628885
No soft job.	17.80703558884673
Saves them.	23.564602268454635
Nature.	43.689762616181284
Washing child, washing corpse.	13.420341801681577
Dignam.	28.52766606093321
Children ’ s hands always round them.	10.772147792839743
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	7.369905676171759
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	9.69384350008419
Fill it up with wind.	17.024885773781666
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	15.938925612957103
Must call to the hospital.	14.400602284472875
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	10.01358379044981
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	8.80674745614246
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	8.502200700029912
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	10.107027167375943
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	10.33100924834056
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	8.618011685092481
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	11.517840746625332
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	11.854028762129657
Chickens come home to roost.	13.926347187319545
They stick by one another like glue.	11.225902296520447
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	14.138640372232736
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	8.365420981029482
It ’ s the blood of the south.	13.555398389799008
Moorish.	49.467177074702796
Also the form, the figure.	16.101341647912527
Hands felt for the opulent.	12.82306704446276
Just compare for instance those others.	11.337705844583688
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	9.930075064635107
Allow me to introduce my.	15.470227425963559
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	9.980314225384118
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	11.976879591618735
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	12.028161843194429
Have their own secrets between them.	12.341510694314254
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	11.136770981332228
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	8.423135701276165
As God made them he matched them.	11.196681763346284
Twice nought makes one.	13.887597701080667
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	7.945057529267915
Marry in May and repent in December.	8.562835698833533
This wet is very unpleasant.	12.457478223199304
Stuck.	45.61529184064059
Well the foreskin is not back.	9.547204927500246
Better detach.	19.90940755690301
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	8.63046608846787
Long and the short of it.	13.902721927039043
Very strange about my watch.	14.27529565952296
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	14.01238218195696
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	11.22201686870334
Yes, I suppose, at once.	14.285670329520643
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	10.351809009138291
I remember looking in Pill lane.	10.709567806336583
Also that now is magnetism.	13.244600769597579
Back of everything magnetism.	13.818494931228106
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	10.637393080860855
That causes movement.	16.41546543094265
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	13.712676883596643
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	8.276666150451636
Because it ’ s all arranged.	17.970422206953355
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	12.4818248673919
Little piece of steel iron.	14.090646690985718
When you hold out the fork.	13.225988332117774
Come.	22.108245157254114
Come.	22.108245157254114
Woman and man that is.	16.79239745920115
Fork and steel.	16.289951695663962
Molly, he.	22.189183201404127
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	10.091453363034862
Tip.	35.564133659099035
Have to let fly.	17.188592363339314
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	12.131481312340059
Shame all put on before third person.	11.014563708192256
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	13.064017065430331
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	8.35156942254094
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	8.20216619719419
Fine voice that fellow had.	17.572975637361264
How Giuglini began.	14.656579975989239
Smell that I did.	19.89873604381388
Like flowers.	23.884953932512047
It was too.	16.02809553214039
Violets.	44.80800061837366
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	8.757679470038488
Make their own use of everything.	13.856383656387763
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	9.037249710564254
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	10.232346125184609
Keep that thing up for hours.	14.167608049046775
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	10.800758458940166
Wait.	16.117996620458218
Hm. Hm. Yes.	11.986359344842986
That ’ s her perfume.	11.018134215812452
Why she waved her hand.	12.162285762517492
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	11.909664099362995
What is it?	11.96707899805774
Heliotrope?	44.699101331895235
No. Hyacinth?	15.722246738827733
Hm. Roses, I think.	11.510158552233834
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	13.27949298135079
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	11.139299383872363
Why Molly likes opoponax.	13.015020789784746
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	15.971714952479143
Her high notes and her low notes.	11.055726093448227
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	9.656340467827128
Heat brought it out.	17.662222393187207
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	11.525303028883977
Good conductor, is it?	14.47988167637386
Or bad?	25.22331626826748
Light too.	23.446135403969798
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	13.361531075180267
Mysterious thing too.	16.407801308393257
Why did I smell it only now?	11.95028557355595
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	8.763641586978634
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	8.6820664530272
Yes, it is.	13.934787423365371
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	7.2913255284159435
Tell you what it is.	16.550191854761174
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	8.6668618301725
Clings to everything she takes off.	11.652790798455884
Warm shoe.	25.165944514227583
Stays.	44.80800061837366
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	10.364913370716797
Byby till next time.	14.528740955691838
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	8.994822655925955
Know her smell in a thousand.	13.397492154594664
Bathwater too.	22.771176164339398
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	11.480206427873373
There or the armpits or under the neck.	10.806111758425724
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	12.602650577058153
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	8.717677516497927
Muskrat.	44.80800061837366
Bag under their tails.	16.61385736456002
One grain pour off odour for years.	9.410420425663784

How do you sniff?	14.733777473513925
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	9.733963271419109
Yes now, look at it that way.	16.3644470267037
We ’ re the same.	14.373962290589184
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	9.713790693476543
Come near.	26.282141194621065
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	9.201971379531892
Like what?	24.67977668058931
Potted herrings gone stale or.	11.66579145516462
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	10.69196772536032
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	11.800884400086607
What though?	25.4970732331494
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	11.555635362375929
Breath?	49.951215660697606
What you eat and drink gives that.	9.91201000465486
No. Mansmell, I mean.	11.572636116597481
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different.	9.452687417490287

I knew there was something on my mind.	14.614223146574949
Never went back and the soap not paid.	13.048569026019521
Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning.	9.263753732011162
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.	12.261481808471759
I could mention Meagher ’ s just to remind him.	10.01849198771542
Still if he works that paragraph.	10.939009134138376

Three and nine?	22.384420469936565
Two and nine, sir.	12.715617679477162
Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time.	8.191369889399615

Always at home at dinnertime.	12.843040060292527
Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in.	11.191903489571594
Enjoying nature now.	16.341372259516657
Grace after meals.	14.800288381749304
After supper walk a mile.	11.97360404923413

Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.	9.888876403843083
Still you learn something.	15.029778921235014
See ourselves as others see us.	10.090539129119662

Better now of course than long ago.	12.127010199124735

Still two types there are you bob against.	10.324075575832076
Scowl or smile.	16.75249372594371
Pardon! Not at all.	15.251253072690163
Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun.	10.385804399253976
Some light still.	17.67828974954513
Red rays are longest.	13.365559323322401

When three it ’ s night.	14.560152540409428
Were those nightclouds there all the time?	11.996126703333958
Looks like a phantom ship.	13.33858850073813
Trees are they?	19.55008329028036
An optical illusion.	14.551825149077033
Mirage.	44.80800061837366
Land of the setting sun this.	11.483455368689006
Homerule sun setting in the southeast.	10.167055767940825
My native land, goodnight.	12.035198185663132
Dew falling.	24.057350356316213
Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone.	14.507432372692561
Brings on white fluxions.	12.189911266911944
Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through.	7.958218653764013

Cut with grass or paper worst.	10.103309218382899
Friction of the position.	16.972911483893217
Like to be that rock she sat on.	11.65017863142043
O sweet little, you don ’ t know how nice you looked.	11.177252273355293
I begin to like them at that age.	13.308778279242267
Green apples.	25.414990037992734
Grab at all that offer.	16.381783209069365
Suppose it ’ s the only time we cross legs, seated.	12.294436203533113
Also the library today: those girl graduates.	8.749211933885967
Happy chairs under them.	13.133289571686925
But it ’ s the evening influence.	16.520409225446976
They feel all that.	17.907944133703356
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.	5.720963240069539
Nightstock in Mat Dillon ’ s garden where I kissed her shoulder.	9.109229819842001

History repeats itself.	17.557758178150994
Ye crags and peaks I ’ m with you once again.	9.632419181929627
Life, love, voyage round your own little world.	9.955415124030242
And now?	22.86752523192913
Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.	9.85416243099593
They take advantage.	16.96435373164425
The distant hills seem.	13.122835622811007
Where we.	25.183219979764793
The rhododendrons.	23.06222368810171
I am a fool perhaps.	12.738284705881165
He gets the plums, and I the plumstones.	12.247600641396856
Where I come in.	16.311472277844686
All that old hill has seen.	12.783131365302753
Names change: that ’ s all.	15.004536747833233
Lovers: yum yum.	11.49546680170848
Tired I feel now.	16.155634713966737
Will I get up?	20.21624472498873
Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch.	11.700423931723195
She kissed me.	15.042363558589582
Never again.	23.262520681953102
My youth.	25.56555296536044
Only once it comes.	14.866991403220487
Or hers.	22.92710425995569
Take the train there tomorrow.	12.06044471810848
No. Returning not the same.	11.529827382544473
Like kids your second visit to a house.	10.13918451646224
The new I want.	17.26235995713071
Nothing new under the sun.	12.955799521900687

Are you not happy in your?	12.071324914877524
Naughty darling.	24.75391696227837
At Dolphin ’ s barn charades in Luke Doyle ’ s house.	8.21765790337345
Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty.	5.6753425320167965

Eightyseven that was.	20.86480885200557
Year before we.	19.765902991722232
Curious she an only child, I an only child.	10.391810687364995
So it returns.	16.109002717698278
Think you ’ re escaping and run into yourself.	11.03571542740892
Longest way round is the shortest way home.	9.638194456431053
And just when he and she.	16.788276045588088
Circus horse walking in a ring.	14.646844938367988
Rip van Winkle we played.	11.252345367012389
Rip: tear in Henny Doyle ’ s overcoat.	9.203611013575417
Van: breadvan delivering.	11.624445912156462
Winkle: cockles and periwinkles.	11.73704303831836
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	9.680498331498768
She leaned on the sideboard watching.	12.57080607544677
Moorish eyes.	26.65050336790516
Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.	9.864720113051996
All changed.	23.973242670289075
Forgotten.	35.31585665834903
The young are old.	13.97228511320323
His gun rusty from the dew.	11.485168716878619
Ba. What is that flying about?	14.213148951156148
Swallow?	44.699101331895235
Thinks I ’ m a tree, so blind.	14.190931748143846
Have birds no smell?	15.28289366353663
Metempsychosis.	52.58152020057017
They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief.	10.125382687651504
Weeping willow.	21.50892676324382
Ba. There he goes.	15.366949575667658
Funny little beggar.	16.35214663918217
Wonder where he lives.	15.242692934848716
Belfry up there.	19.228793378469042
Very likely.	23.747486208152466
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	11.504330450919927
Bell scared him out, I suppose.	14.256689146047712
Mass seems to be over.	15.505808711485846
Could hear them all at it.	15.971963702094587
Pray for us.	19.517907790917178
And pray for us.	12.680331296135808
And pray for us.	12.680331296135808
Good idea the repetition.	11.971843532628768
Same thing with ads.	14.30128255246635
Buy from us.	17.583014563454558
And buy from us.	14.183371465473893
Yes, there ’ s the light in the priest ’ s house.	13.274736520232727
Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom ’ s.	9.784126228217893
Twentyeight it is.	19.5123050269405
Two houses they have.	16.364287125333217
Gabriel Conroy ’ s brother is curate.	13.22310755074739
Ba. Again.	16.590383162764155
Wonder why they come out at night like mice.	13.147381946298124
They ’ re a mixed breed.	12.220174664125812
Birds are like hopping mice.	11.341254718227283
What frightens them, light or noise?	11.015047626178863
Better sit still.	17.030427246621795
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	8.221771969738576
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	12.064131007241562
Weeny bones.	22.678659074473305
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.	10.596406543575457
Colours depend on the light you see.	11.152115490662592
Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	7.625368823043361
Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.	11.34781242937795
Colour of brown turf.	14.89520726349995
Not true.	24.066309514812577
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	7.582477344904548
Body fifty different colours.	13.52371576026352
Howth a while ago amethyst.	12.444364083431129
Glass flashing.	23.058416632988227
That ’ s how that wise man what ’ s his name with the burning glass.	9.820522062906518
Then the heather goes on fire.	11.022199723980048
It can ’ t be tourists ’ matches.	12.30904285584215
What?	14.626800461768257
Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.	8.656820180178853
Archimedes.	44.80800061837366
I have it! My memory ’ s not so bad.	13.80924545382183
Ba. Who knows what they ’ re always flying for.	11.922554073960608
Insects?	49.951215660697606
Might be the one bit me, come back to see.	12.74030246007677
Birds too.	22.756846670050898
Never find out.	19.016985477419606
Or what they say.	16.841211388768492
Like our small talk.	13.561461775250045
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	11.841548621813256
Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.	8.680270149182789
Dreadful life sailors have too.	10.96314140547445
Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	7.750458187987447
_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	6.830726028499636
Married too.	24.001498083821954
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	12.1620621646771
No ends really because it ’ s round.	13.487347800793128
Wife in every port they say.	12.103338778734315
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	8.423388564558465
If ever he does.	17.50167463841071
Smelling the tail end of ports.	10.466595289104509
How can they like the sea?	16.454181901051676
Yet they do.	19.353472263947932
The anchor ’ s weighed.	12.464802513347701
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	8.970223417804116
Well.	29.81512296867109
And the tephilim no what ’ s this they call it poor papa ’ s father had on his door to touch.	9.574180266398091
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	10.971931000337412
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	10.136031466125583
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	7.803301113122293
Do fish ever get seasick?	11.954210308274027
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones ’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	6.0893892040067135
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	12.345060374650211
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	5.714274277770988
They floated, fell: they faded.	12.092692154245858
The shepherd ’ s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	9.165549777762756
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	7.135095081392423
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	6.829740689540995
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	7.078739674004871
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	9.953368838145645
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	8.490376633295659
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	6.826630312954528
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	6.599616058447915
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	5.9327942694100075
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	12.042868529157388
Irish Lights board.	15.346598886253876
Penance for their sins.	15.950664415897597
Coastguards too.	22.771176164339398
Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat.	9.31774390759943
Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin ’ s King, throwing them the sack of old papers.	8.68144792126645
Bears in the zoo.	14.0630044063697
Filthy trip.	22.35669612553341
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	12.327143761516014
Puking overboard to feed the herrings.	10.006510567934182
Nausea.	44.80800061837366
And the women, fear of God in their faces.	12.197131907177262
Milly, no sign of funk.	12.881091603841066
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	11.492396591330634
Don ’ t know what death is at that age.	11.860491821744116
And then their stomachs clean.	10.925754530883372
But being lost they fear.	11.971175263409414
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	10.127924995613165
I didn ’ t want to.	11.81901691728694
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	9.442556772283305
Frightening them with masks too.	12.402798758383126
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	15.626135876889986
I ’ ll murder you.	12.097716910896423
Is it only half fun?	14.976095369629242
Or children playing battle.	13.43221999621953
Whole earnest.	22.356554037087502
How can people aim guns at each other.	8.945334940971483
Sometimes they go off.	18.064269161025543
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	7.304399871067349
After getting better asleep with Molly.	11.251623487243283
Very same teeth she has.	13.462727960279809
What do they love?	17.498205780424954
Another themselves?	25.465257792514947
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	11.020190632633033
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	17.17238797403363
I felt her pulse.	14.906083698509082
Ticking.	44.80800061837366
Little hand it was: now big.	14.773987164374466
All that the hand says when you touch.	12.05039305331083
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	11.056133575514684
Her first stays I remember.	12.252285459509556
Made me laugh to see.	12.439407774133146
Little paps to begin with.	11.069131803071958
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	11.103553847373387
Nearer the heart?	21.0443102887502
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	9.19933373993472
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	12.621999140207821
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	9.609509183444409
Brings back her girlhood.	14.389851407477074
Gibraltar.	46.566656502276295
Looking from Buena Vista.	10.13376320693599
O ’ Hara ’ s tower.	11.697983191566962
The seabirds screaming.	15.272184785819372
Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family.	8.656956056012783
Looking out over the sea she told me.	13.306367546944387
Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.	12.968949560108005
I always thought I ’ d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht.	9.262126707537488
_Buenas noches, señorita.	11.61550853760464
El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa_.	6.603381702806536
Why me?	24.425068815812935
Because you were so foreign from the others.	12.73092266891684
Better not stick here all night like a limpet.	10.185607826251
This weather makes you dull.	12.788914250872544
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	12.320107904200398
Go home.	23.215298036475346
Too late for _Leah, Lily of <URL> No. Might be still up.	7.717100914836362
Call to the hospital to see.	13.451122260940588
Hope she ’ s over.	14.466491826742446
Long day I ’ ve had.	16.80894476797465
Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus ’ song.	8.851961152249382
Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan ’ s.	7.258684640413868
Got my own back there.	14.1609849130441
Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince.	10.696209546205987
Mistake to hit back.	13.15216866420482
Or?	41.84385614983635
No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.	10.422343967996497
Always want to be swilling in company.	12.269166953574459
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	14.097226334170161
Suppose he hit me.	14.15594636798606
Look at it other way round.	14.27932982365532
Not so bad then.	15.906267507463426
Perhaps not to hurt he meant.	14.320892357210871
Three cheers for Israel.	13.202451058809732
Three cheers for the sister - in - law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	8.141445746452147
Same style of beauty.	13.711846759379554
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.	11.409404460423794
The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.	10.37377646099186
Imagine that in the early morning at close range.	11.369729363510936
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow.	9.026822765890445
But Dignam ’ s put the boots on it.	12.830552797378076
Anyhow she wants the money.	13.542438060376085
Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	9.808518775804124
Strange name.	25.387329616573496
Takes it for granted we ’ re going to pop off first.	10.981078412577853
That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer ’ s that looked at me.	9.67498626479839
Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium.	8.033691655669374
Her widow ’ s mite.	13.760670428423035
Well?	29.037771862354383
What do you expect her to do?	13.175832237730459
Must wheedle her way along.	12.237326785996155
Widower I hate to see.	14.481574931990059
Looks so forlorn.	16.40139240189797
Poor man O ’ Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here.	8.176996455297875
The sewage.	21.15589306140155
Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him.	8.54414036881696
Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron.	10.340787360223482
Ladies ’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain.	8.016856015382086
Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.	10.14225402543725
Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die.	9.000493334561924
See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick.	8.998703525973195
U.	20.10413265164004

Fate that is.	19.503400076672698
He, not me.	11.777223626190747
Also a shop often noticed.	11.98717920531664
Curse seems to dog it.	12.964486535650604
Dreamt last night?	19.872682475791876
Wait.	16.117996620458218
Something confused.	19.796312636726444
She had red slippers on.	12.624371164072441
Turkish.	41.7339802402361
Wore the breeches.	17.658951173252337
Suppose she does?	20.365463849144803
Would I like her in pyjamas?	14.14126321219775
Damned hard to answer.	16.414253408671822
Nannetti ’ s gone.	18.041562875138194
Mailboat.	44.80800061837366
Near Holyhead by now.	12.187932346843828
Must nail that ad of Keyes ’ s.	9.544249395796136
Work Hynes and Crawford.	13.424231936207914
Petticoats for Molly.	18.967263647287815
She has something to put in them.	14.818954437874286
What ’ s that?	11.98959973068265
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	11.367478382240352
He brought it near his eyes and peered.	14.462721297686207
Letter?	44.49980942284441
No. Can ’ t read.	13.412678993419652
Better go.	24.2482562003102
Better.	30.17608041474432
I ’ m tired to move.	11.178718064073959
Page of an old copybook.	15.983961569887745
All those holes and pebbles.	10.73734229050905
Who could count them?	14.20231814029369
Never know what you find.	17.67386500584183
Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck.	10.393178442768397
Parcels post.	24.12735438235475
Children always want to throw things in the sea.	12.414277049449362
Trust?	44.632274217224825
Bread cast on the waters.	15.014038214168238
What ’ s this?	17.20060268456252
Bit of stick.	16.677416362308175
O! Exhausted that female has me.	8.99584314386535
Not so young now.	15.56318417934009
Will she come here tomorrow?	13.634823761596982
Wait for her somewhere for ever.	13.688615529070955
Murderers do.	24.087386935183734
Will I?	26.284030648904892
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	8.9381123276746
Write a message for her.	13.268961757549976
Might remain.	24.255314105294683
I.	12.520119916928751
Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning.	12.20285316192943
Useless.	42.5243479435742
Washed away.	25.465329786218053
Tide comes here.	16.98030514028132
Saw a pool near her foot.	12.177833492131517
Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	10.582796659695704
All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	7.7664522144227
O, those transparent! Besides they don ’ t know.	9.592634902422004
What is the meaning of that other world.	12.18371496776651
I called you naughty boy because I do not like.	10.255189016244342
AM.	44.80800061837366
A.	12.93983968749198
No room.	24.85970947129551
Let it go.	17.208256298335026
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	9.644670804940363
Hopeless thing sand.	16.729033670932516
Nothing grows in it.	14.647310486433717
All fades.	22.223435889655114
No fear of big vessels coming up here.	9.487170807548235
Except Guinness ’ s barges.	13.467976424010551
Round the Kish in eighty days.	9.737990904084132
Done half by design.	15.220538225288783
He flung his wooden pen away.	9.825188990427076
Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn ’ t.	10.469631444156674
Chance.	44.80800061837366
We ’ ll never meet again.	13.182286762401871
But it was lovely.	18.03036623398027
Goodbye, dear.	18.63129769590201
Thanks.	30.435829865532387
Made me feel so young.	15.611212696770709
Short snooze now if I had.	12.723134421978134
Must be near nine.	14.055564809453598
Liverpool boat long gone.	14.727785926651627
Not even the smoke.	14.938041540049372
And she can do the other.	16.064268505101214
Did too.	23.647415097881947
And Belfast.	24.74986594689149
I won ’ t go.	16.82901472314701
Race there, race back to Ennis.	13.540527159576015
Let him.	19.892284238513422
Just close my eyes a moment.	14.140337429856734
Won ’ t sleep, though.	14.041049608142728
Half dream.	25.19125291545006
It never comes the same.	13.926017544975304
Bat again.	22.925816972849656
No harm in him.	16.599046032513545
Just a few.	21.942716442503468

There.	22.8168429261208
Here.	19.774642670857872
Far in the grey a bell chimed.	12.503351868175665
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	9.064865131950315
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest ’ s house cooed where Canon O ’ Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	7.878120174869823

Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	9.674468983092204

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	4.830694204772988
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	5.157916530165279
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	7.914654930737916
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O ’ Shiels, the O ’ Hickeys, the O ’ Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	5.978461434453297
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	5.4968247404769714
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	5.7015714940327324

In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid.	5.577303683305528
Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland ’ s westward welkin.	6.388825760049635
Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	6.314793288146187
Christ ’ s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	7.444716430503579
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne ’ s house.	7.459040777886698
Loth to irk in Horne ’ s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	7.7510287847345225
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	6.014205146405069
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	9.987479948703479
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.	7.960975915254474
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	7.998419497822602
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	6.1603865002575855
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	10.858886792290532
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	6.5082321795097435
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	10.77701395794669
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	6.287172216404734
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	7.569501336069046
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	6.884963341534665
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	9.18635484716605
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	7.521010164023396
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	8.683980908112122
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	9.826026616404173
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	9.470826511624045
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	9.067559843391729
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	10.483088731812026
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	8.478254666012475
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	7.679297187882085
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	8.146731302916772
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	9.683139165947583
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	6.57548914225155
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	10.74718311588845
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	9.31563276167326
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	6.9931616867312565
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	7.551197420456742
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	6.433297996827096
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	6.716297911190985
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	5.831799657364467
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	7.420192671783749
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	6.462493037464463
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	6.072733675607038
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	6.431140869274848
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	6.914494086785038
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	7.23831578980082
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	6.241176957572497
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	6.5586232874670545
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	11.51310664807637
Thanked be Almighty God.	12.624486814251426
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	6.6232248566873295
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	8.516437184229376
Meseems it dureth overlong.	10.17222741676802
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	7.509036003247236
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	8.138077440378046
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	8.43950474447342
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	8.62624074771671
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	7.317666618996208
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	11.856265630026668
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	9.23906635599867
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	6.780917031253975
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	7.587415347721189
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	8.671778489682788
For they were right witty scholars.	11.508447257418998
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	6.792584424402264
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	7.93034687974087
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	6.846933911576257
A redress God grant.	11.519317357200185
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	7.388993495566203
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	6.377273279049591
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	6.735208740761189
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	6.610749409077273
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	7.353457777210968
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	6.82155281866714
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	10.635351554798126
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	7.550972371053848
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	6.858839223970602
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	7.915620792300154
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	6.436791889349716
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	7.507572754153342
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	6.017243391898742
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	6.15666309211985
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	7.0698757705951945
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	6.836614479581651
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	9.186859720513118
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	9.118681416401818
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	6.591499325758412
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	6.9818044861092865
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	6.054263210050073
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	7.114790049227652
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	9.29508768981675
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	8.244446838341146
See ye here.	16.345816669585115
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	8.332082765879539
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	7.517022565263005
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions.	7.76654308057322
What means this?	18.037072155799176
Desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	7.137938855197482
Mark me now.	18.64636789336457
In woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	7.547555187339729
This is the postcreation.	14.518069374636923
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	7.715570686981968
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	5.894961716428941
But here is the matter now.	14.775471788742575
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	6.605205982125952
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l ’ avait mise dans cette fichue position c ’ était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	3.860945494804516
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	11.512451998565735
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	8.006943731537488
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	7.694027601317576
With will will we withstand, withsay.	8.76881032078804
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	5.866304247199976
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	5.950338849439843
In Horne ’ s house rest should reign.	11.916904731854512
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	6.332092183927668
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	7.150683288540646
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	8.783990895676357
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	5.585717740811489
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	5.945730411524292
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	4.20965815827665
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	7.131403366841622
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	7.878935701294813
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	11.49261278774649
Go thou and do likewise.	13.82942335091196

Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	9.158607010415231

Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	6.9231553173229115

And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	5.63134667571363
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	6.047497488135351

And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	5.9890908885003284
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	6.613134020402916
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	7.5991823634306455
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	7.556608280338748
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	6.740161677546572
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	7.428775230516201
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	7.806733748213244
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	10.255298888344912
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	11.87743267161303
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	8.829542867755315
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	11.606250844169518
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	8.965073147970427
Heard?	44.49980942284441
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	9.956361810035983
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	10.977156113602012
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	11.519543329006307
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	7.587806033939425
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	7.353776970684167
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	8.218118247553273
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	6.339285875400502
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	6.347683194037
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	7.385221696617337
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	10.146035043263643
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	5.1279939879832455
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	8.051747188252337
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	6.300053009203932
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	7.014473438517794
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	6.802935612043926
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	6.034247331588632
Over against the Rt. Hon.	9.062028360510572

Mulligan a gentleman ’ s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore ’ s the writer ’ s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	8.7396466602751
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	7.362548925090351
There Leop.	20.866694473834013

Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	7.33629648245285
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	7.395027708838587
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	6.316296831192305
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	6.471131573621547
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	9.025765382508641
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	6.679822087019924
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	7.094154922162379
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	9.599477656211803
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	8.905509010086556
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	9.811364104718047
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	8.13208267357865
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	6.898452973887622
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	6.225426539005319
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	7.6238516502797244
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	10.599812408935996
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	9.457833732976635
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	9.024119698381098
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	5.575074076282431
I question with you there, says he.	13.686533784790225
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	8.029226271626815
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	7.328417563466655
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	11.188307428241924
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	8.89754887462323
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	15.552400233427703
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	8.615862622092134
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	10.257125609831691
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	7.446793684201737
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	8.393340813620679
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	8.943808871916575
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	7.777097535488155
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	7.527922494427611
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	8.797948051272014
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	6.667533134473127
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	9.25599124981375
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	6.689412262936311
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	8.88200671026163
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	9.288635802851955
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	7.08811335067047
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	9.429263736143128
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	7.718511900092817
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	9.265667519792174
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	6.426229132816629
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	8.271945530855467
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	7.408773284596757
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	6.774616302339545
Fertiliser and Incubator.	14.586533397380395
Lambay Island_.	21.389793365873583
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	6.608139834643235
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	13.377649688765613
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	8.757237555146308
Come, be seated, both.	13.666818792906417
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	7.144515635645647
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	6.05955498734763
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	5.935739352116725
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	5.75355621151673
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	6.154343838429826
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	13.107036469265331
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	6.654431471839955
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	5.378740753168244
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	7.4832480980016935
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	8.130998348703356
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	6.436651431339471
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	4.5153619031656005
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	6.530682601495078
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	9.139950549990365
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	8.65619215824904
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	7.805146417901382
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	6.4079548410325895
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	6.796020440979124
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	6.69373726016276
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	7.690467473348136
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	6.690628805209764
That you may and very opportunely.	10.818075388611978
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	8.67770810969357
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	8.08279293015482
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	7.040664483825223
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	6.796399358468012
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	11.668327492217808
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	7.433097874487778
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	8.041163287491088
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	5.5264070552665245
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	13.23814830054091
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	8.620092104113354
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	11.969585110237919
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	8.904893652104604
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	9.25294314997772
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	7.749028272394921
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	6.485705683499517
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	6.396308405426823
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	9.558372705810154
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	9.38597584756071
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	8.10294899123506
No woman of any wit would wear one.	10.625974509556416
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	8.628258763099735
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	6.836724781188843
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	7.858441083478962
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	6.368377633199401
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	9.140304933014939
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	8.1158612329736
What, you dog?	16.894358478596555
Have you a way with them?	17.049089749688115
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	9.660750698616575
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	7.187468376522969
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	8.322370118229484
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	10.962190682122412
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	8.287513345609383
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	7.7635497212804525
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	6.917688780989309
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	7.722386959440085
I cannot away with them.	15.191314087218778
What?	14.626800461768257
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	8.87422609998213
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	7.901211598019262
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	7.308016360021569
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	7.972290868818051
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	6.598040632134632
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	8.004620127138137
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	7.549078063252204
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	5.589905573178155
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	6.932267437780121
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	6.240903458936577
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	6.242258239522529
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	6.28718431102528
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	7.655691988397756
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	7.4333811730706145
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	9.28073096360186
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	7.304610396736994
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	8.734753121339587
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	10.97921602915941
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	6.92992779146339
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	7.2394643151370985
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	5.193462013765522
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	7.1739816291628715
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	6.398137531420929
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	8.561920530220052
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	6.268266519483354
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	8.263640179208647
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	9.02543315492608
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	8.08125457867218
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	6.7308506439906095
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	6.025497335035016
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	9.087121520096574
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	7.052699332814582
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	6.816019391748592
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	4.414695132686972
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	6.6593849565413645
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	5.300030962582523
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	6.182226390953555
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	5.377275797562848
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	7.998736201670103
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	6.583713827773431
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	4.96215411092649
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	5.908671260668212
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	6.1504935183631435
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	6.16123070727241
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	9.143167096522202
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	6.417030010696918
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	5.155342398240725
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	6.677805034252704
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	8.101616190765625
He conjured up the scene before them.	11.815472498840766
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	8.847385949399717
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	7.337529335771747
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	9.151029387056763
Yes, it is true.	15.602639781676935
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	8.386042055119239
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	8.089399149634952
This is the appearance is on me.	13.435553175719322
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	8.05142384737053
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	15.041843425840693
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	10.162277822032584
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	6.7722243491028165
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	9.256767428692271
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	7.517997509813332
He was gone.	17.327993264885126
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	10.918931532620906
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	7.10954474948681
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	7.30351949229954
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	9.125867740323029
The mystery was unveiled.	12.96474204341171
Haines was the third brother.	16.607254982218716
His real name was Childs.	13.348897136444215
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	11.01407343362945
He drank drugs to obliterate.	10.530406495269828
For this relief much thanks.	9.894479639358387
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	8.587555260281663
No soul will live there.	12.892082524094857
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	7.924123637683138
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	10.283260581907072
A curse is on it.	14.845237427333828
It is haunted.	14.94090800646951
Murderer ’ s ground.	13.21966705766524
What is the age of the soul of man?	13.066321245137098
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	6.908585242277352
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	6.445272131850019
A score of years are blown away.	11.26522367357215
He is young Leopold.	13.912951627280592
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	8.350028193173053
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	7.297908843901584
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	7.465105304448519
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	6.705730042174872
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	9.840877871456755
Who can say?	21.338587379072703
The wise father knows his own child.	11.538089989606958
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	8.332553208072765
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	8.179427125299023
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	9.874897597756682
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	7.250160896499012
Did heart leap to heart?	12.413245437039365
Nay, fair reader.	13.947298354645863
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	6.755114154758729
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	10.347608653684336
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	8.130462706499685
No, Leopold.	18.673376899184337
Name and memory solace thee not.	9.500297424442751
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	7.7834965371661236
No son of thy loins is by thee.	10.302768280976071
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	10.447129926125573
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	6.464397801187661
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	4.819704934471204
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	7.788933205478108
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	5.706511790936611
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	9.680690695305072
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	8.628858032526997
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	15.050895855276005
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	7.251369456609607
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	5.951766383446465
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	5.8331816882591045
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	4.815271830812731
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	7.34956139746868
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	6.590754762843547
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	8.158400010645886
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	10.767289491497813
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	6.838326084424949
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	5.316904349413593
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	9.78466345082789
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	6.621334662750695
Where were they now?	16.930092956897138
Neither knew.	24.223377061224912
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	10.3609244293586
Why think of them?	21.408617749928055
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	8.558338166400569
Who supposes it?	15.438683295011096
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	5.874412619842388
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	6.505161425400876
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	7.257422132232365
All who wish you well hope this for you.	9.287810175014464
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	8.465264541302982
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	10.365043980395296
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	11.407311362719815
Have no fear.	18.254346816575673
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	11.277618430587854
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	13.500625635729213
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	10.926172940341202
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	8.504595608914931
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	7.747233112880124
He told them of the race.	12.803056626140004
Madden up.	23.063132066235976
She was leading the field.	11.760105378033167
All hearts were beating.	14.86033056178921
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	10.754166508448511
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	6.508125780985956
All was lost now.	13.866689114872448
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	12.279993354133223
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	17.20172324551411
A tear fell: one only.	12.23973687981374
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	9.647937709940921
Lane.	46.18192311034901
Four winners yesterday and three today.	11.097089705108665
What rider is like him?	14.590859771462847
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	7.090017297411067
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	12.055477340842677
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	10.572730670106441
She is not the filly that she was.	12.903308494701095
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	9.855211267385483
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	12.330948204885397
Do you remember her, Vincent?	14.339313969945916
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	10.016770039815306
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	7.899919009750311
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	6.457221096975514
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	6.182807114956901
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	6.602068809498555
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	8.170130990107802
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	11.014710863343607
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	8.49348110015316
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	6.574907251679553
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	9.114622171909495
But he had been kind.	16.418832005599906
In going by he had blessed us.	12.436756523184423
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	8.969192215809429
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	7.286249818669974
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	8.447583188552002
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	7.507356894656159
His soul is far away.	14.809173695462865
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	9.649545677669671
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	7.4036599508816
Do you not think it, Stephen?	17.670017061483918
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	7.73267363533032
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	5.877680138854472
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	7.730364372283651
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	5.786662169715995
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	7.153420067195188
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	6.755582755754922
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	8.146915095452604
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	7.481901744228159
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	7.855036385485047
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	8.153177845782412
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	6.85971651992148
A gallant scene in truth it made.	10.240769759467087
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	8.277341322403982
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	7.190706957309779
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	7.196849652544582
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	5.280560540886165
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	5.252182087659164
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	8.289444813221847
Dedalus ’ (Div.	11.600351014338928
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	5.803767245057496
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	7.9627424186369336
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	8.775339027107854
Bloom (Pubb.	14.98537302975642
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	8.841208877481366
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	5.267298185975407
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	6.985884627041557
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	6.837428776768473
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	9.617455829445623
Mr M.	22.840019328478036
Mulligan (Hyg.	15.091157334803007
et Eug.	21.719950955864128
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	5.234504845828978
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	6.2739310873908805
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	5.448660869586839
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	5.9578489817601845
Mr J.	19.44729567745126
Crotthers (Disc.	15.996864763817577
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	5.3297999434808405
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	5.923645088437114
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	7.866861725569975
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	9.020274952972184
Lynch (Bacc.	16.308538983928557
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	6.211381485913442
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	6.704647500714203
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	6.350261088957717
Mr S.	20.612958862126288
Dedalus ’ (Div.	11.600351014338928
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	5.101262194082172
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	5.018656480288599
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	8.364455139660725
Bloom (Pubb.	14.98537302975642
Canv.) which took place in the commons ’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	8.57895594110334

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	7.641096926760491
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	6.81495846120096
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	7.352688049444126
She had.	19.413840227074065
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	10.075110124479897
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	9.130460044420373
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	8.174082930931451
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	7.631610899057036
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	7.016608579274653
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	8.162857849182494
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	6.189120414028327
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	6.430279452067722
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	6.72986030606739
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	8.783290080887612
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	6.986388928181037
He knows and will call in His own good time.	9.999896888359574
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	7.881101143082058
Sir, to you my hand.	15.810194214576946
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	7.7940419486771155
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	8.616346438202752
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	7.40437620748983
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	7.070399753140919
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	6.66374461667017
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	7.524421043199793
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	6.414002294310409
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	6.1810727466183755
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	5.37357716847997
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	6.246187873839633
Mark this farther and remember.	13.00160898753284
The end comes suddenly.	13.60858002852662
Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.	6.935495256506952
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	11.054590368025739
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	6.165830194508609
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	4.942793111761083
Burke ’ s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not.	5.468931126171821

Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom ’ s plight.	8.445035705539155
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat.	7.360871890704534
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.	9.970034684638533
With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	7.483907131835199
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	7.33395830145928
The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.	9.555227545561097
Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.	9.846708865120341

The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay.	5.957950741719381
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen ’ s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute.	9.969761255120245
Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.) _ BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _ (There is no answer; he bends again.) _ Mr Dedalus! _ (There is no answer.) _ The name if you call.	10.613337228289378

_ (Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master.	8.10335520579614
Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.	7.74418952685141
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.) _ BLOOM: _ (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) _ Rudy! RUDY: _ (Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom ’ s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.	7.760356264995642
He has a delicate mauve face.	10.884564762829495
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.	9.040610107849425
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.	8.16750387915656
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	6.6752602850733265
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	7.125504423703538
But how to get there was the rub.	14.219253948263095
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	6.224410923893764
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	6.854687528939698
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	6.939210458149043
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	9.320381442361725
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	6.9822783948011535
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	6.658385778496429
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	6.5132903439821765
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	6.228629163864219
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	7.072635943124912
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	8.920801948087929
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	6.931539493133397
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	7.479833482229997
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	7.412426734234592
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	7.660924079907806
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	5.96791660555275
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	7.608276479103068
s.	12.414448297259668
d.	28.049926376197103
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	6.428136390041957
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	7.020174353276243
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	10.311616646154476
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	6.831415008273925
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	7.721707766932121
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	7.65205234903259
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	9.246320218703483
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	9.73752643297702
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	6.866899687305362
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	5.878753302075092
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	6.047069897301998
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	8.336820541588647
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	10.185952359915408
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	6.053468086880844
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	7.357632546148639
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	6.327457522113654
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	9.585896456169374
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	10.494109127543362
His friends had all deserted him.	10.52221587490558
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	8.860835588931135
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	10.66316236913464
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	8.605568853501879
Anyhow he was all in.	18.331619806880997
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	8.953189649324369
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	9.570781029754562
Try it.	19.373492360942922
You may mention my name.	12.596906514703987
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	9.68979639881924
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	12.148219680905022
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	9.718220312588574
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	10.13610393746669
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	8.414139522927664
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	6.732263264534695
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	9.505979293232212
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	7.78813251465695
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	6.665547551157511
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	9.496669830061226
Whereas.	45.61529184064059
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	8.101211570370598
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	9.424829739590132
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	8.548973786588904
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	7.188262353634891
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	9.647864354172333
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	9.571436155695586
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	9.301908422461754
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	8.793237847491412
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	11.998876816806243
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	13.971500510935014
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	12.554770644584629
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	10.009616939339159
Who ’ s that with you?	17.33336855229505
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	8.555905900356358
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	11.237684677582486
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	9.608162470272108
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	11.666516972220201
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	9.118085420185553
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	7.501210469714265
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	6.812031662499326
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	8.461699615285932
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	6.140765841068594
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	8.961620920015802
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	9.022298906489363
Pretty thick that was certainly.	15.250214252847462
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	9.122379234885447
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	12.91922221305691
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	10.629945025828153
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	6.209073430050098
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	10.809498602699035
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	10.970665047144701
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	11.620593651026546
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	9.931728319769261
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	7.222292168822264
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	9.530319604529614
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	10.70723815647843
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	11.706287121529826
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	8.97285011029618
Simply fag out there for nothing.	12.921080744303595
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	8.68207927263695
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	9.976775979913246
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	7.9831601343604195
Where does he live at present?	12.874755977347705
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	12.974841613107776
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	11.683290356377906
Why?	18.42545846291693
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	8.726606146210978
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	9.19433629638372
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	8.161204158391586
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	7.195269112297583
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	7.429133028448571
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	8.077941822448686
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	11.789013055479368
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	8.041114400464616
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	6.745618148048548
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	9.47881372842497
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	6.967107295482231
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	7.043294584540362
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	6.114480940676637
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	5.299105108307292
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	13.905120148213767
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	7.279791837461706
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	4.9928449455336805
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	7.506465431091429
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	6.942906251438565
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	5.08878504826076
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	7.434633410855201
I mean for singing purposes.	11.599250060747329
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	11.264771279530246
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	9.679996609903066
_Belladonna.	44.80800061837366
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	8.694820956623152
They were haggling over money.	9.922866318413906
— Is that so?	13.892709140664596
Mr Bloom asked.	11.237967463862901
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	6.229678501069796
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	7.297249421934973
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	9.520706738993997
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	7.338874332852877
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	9.322907119605482
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	8.60084156214307
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	19.005822580357965
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	10.839657475567194
What ’ s in a name?	12.56295915358185
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	10.621683965268257
Of course.	17.214246389800753
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	9.453455320928589
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	7.432403231554159
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	7.284712435499527
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	6.699339937736381
— You know Simon Dedalus?	13.296334282632781
he asked at length.	12.183328011354611
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	11.0345609975452
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	10.734048602260511
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	8.80740573409498
All Irish.	24.921397359327138
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	11.65922664792865
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	8.160049079079961
The lefthand dead shot.	11.624572698973827
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	7.834182799553881
— Bottles out there, say.	12.879010518427767
Fifty yards measured.	15.858258326024039
Eggs on the bottles.	16.8142908947471
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	10.855594477794865
Aims.	44.80800061837366
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	9.890917755973021
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	7.441029302312911
— Pom! he then shouted once.	11.32273249226355
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	7.002783024951334
— Pom! he shouted twice.	11.646576501257103
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	5.9278585018158605
— Long ago?	18.871294987467515
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	8.114287763509596
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	8.00526389884995
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	7.810124289049624
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	13.967625965760229
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	10.04214744465615
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	14.79452557885923
D.	18.46135330716019
B.	17.770077165899938
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	15.933681132312959
Know where that is?	19.573780536617097
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	12.403498689640147
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	10.70292157201405
That ’ s where I hails from.	9.179631230198284
I belongs there.	17.877553174125627
That ’ s where I hails from.	9.179631230198284
My little woman ’ s down there.	13.272860256987485
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	14.636602389144857
_For England, home and beauty_.	12.91513221319084
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	8.814105161938642
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	6.561599058801636
Across the world for a wife.	14.83713614627475
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	6.427504020206437
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	8.345617148312536
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	6.300302172406485
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	10.167329596513785
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	8.878759086476991
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	10.051004269018561
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	7.150796984406766
No chair for father.	13.871608678175846
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	7.184178625088712
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	7.319736161597287
Grin and bear it.	13.977542816895768
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	7.713219141918934
B.	17.770077165899938
Murphy.	41.20933982431389
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	9.276206351070746
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	8.069876557286957
— Thank you, the sailor said.	11.82735103776396
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	7.855736225886839
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	7.310105005132695
I shipped to get over.	14.232658707840852
Paid off this afternoon.	15.333620388167015
There ’ s my discharge.	14.887921142794873
See?	30.926421328246875
D.	18.46135330716019
B.	17.770077165899938
Murphy.	41.20933982431389
A.	12.93983968749198
B.	17.770077165899938
S.	16.571640904015453
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	7.21965031154366
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	9.77446838263579
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	8.746539965598956
I was in the Red Sea.	13.271820720773245
I was in China and North America and South America.	8.529398730864779
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	7.824858497818523
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	9.067981372827266
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	7.334836436406255
I seen Russia.	16.13875663666742
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	19.669709954004386
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	10.233843235332724
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	9.380153985179984
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	8.01141796445683
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	9.004478433885145
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	7.5616205903150995
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	7.672889444383959
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	6.73042481276083
Look here.	22.405602037706288
Here they are.	20.49624954751256
A friend of mine sent me.	13.787185912578902
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	8.286160590107169
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	7.78106420264977
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	5.652194937085002
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	7.789068564117698
Stomachs like breadgraters.	14.614627121156792
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	10.75880116411732
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	7.808790947624444
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	6.64412672691761
— Know how to keep them off?	14.769903419690886
he inquired generally.	13.925130258061271
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	8.885349545516707
That boggles ’ em.	11.394547281422227
Glass.	39.10929477747043
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	6.384535484017219
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	6.12891264586497
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	5.84435229093756
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	6.925417794783032
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	7.211452338259438
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	6.092667688621883
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	5.868848103755752
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	8.130886433269195
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	5.733837791840644
That was the rub.	14.562037336075418
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	6.466778616478214
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	6.3915911270002
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	6.046968401596381
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	8.158488797312968
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	7.422869157364187
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	10.700622229456519
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	7.9786467052625465
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	12.024024718127103
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	8.21975028731258
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	7.110904191489746
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	9.482146145303506
Knife in his back.	18.63377733184333
Knife like that.	19.143859386754418
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	7.341027489609466
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	7.250867895006247
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	12.878546849189206
Like that.	17.107892394552803
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	9.683255740907416
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	13.797856723016
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	5.913473155917496
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	8.046541509462996
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	5.663998130923906
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	9.053470777768972
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	8.020481534008768
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	6.666384052018423
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	7.826453103965249
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	8.225744177412363
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	9.317274002838207
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	7.0606513739631245
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	10.803960781142365
Give us back them papers.	12.354027253812141
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	7.86947552107351
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	11.086629680205087
Mr Bloom inquired.	17.252864464273674
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	10.485156173504496
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	8.243104562948265
— What year would that be about?	11.831579473565847
Mr B interrogated.	17.134330519731897
Can you recall the boats?	12.141549251338528
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	8.721466499314909
Salt junk all the time.	12.264602007429838
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	13.456280529090185
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	7.353536536467472
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	6.862872395040003
And it left him wondering why.	10.633626797511099
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	9.292666678485864
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	8.902202742124695
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	6.791236523910336
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	7.631699014716163
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	11.58382851720362
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	8.481793098778487
I hate roaming about.	12.935615696821463
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	8.625613303980247
— What age is he?	12.886762720471516
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	6.997437408227917
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	9.252599141712073
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	9.429183880922434
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	6.971471483459565
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	7.749764566625761
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	10.321654441447869
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	7.966354988972931
I hate those buggers.	13.467977687987636
Suck your blood dry, they does.	10.647964136938645
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	8.135984124259195
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	9.534923284070313
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	7.702327408683434
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	11.969267894835033
There he is himself, a Greek.	14.488535340030188
one asked the sailor.	11.815826112202144
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	9.33820084534472
Someway in his.	21.38317393347131
Squeezing or.	24.69798513524
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	15.478903046800912
There he is cursing the mate.	11.104197394811248
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	10.507326122630118
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	6.2999853775170855
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	8.823730153221856
He ’ s gone too.	12.595729952213366
Ate by sharks after.	12.469984839426825
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	8.535845168136804
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	9.099765744783154
— And what ’ s the number for?	14.39504124169369
loafer number two queried.	13.926930586867083
a third asked the sailor.	9.75362830942278
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	7.785214814572615
Ate.	44.19093781523242
A Greek he was.	16.23760902370207
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	7.30365360639555
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	8.667379565183694
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	8.34616880741676
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	8.591230456745954
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	7.477392210424028
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	8.288847585031663
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	7.497683527374878
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	10.456668296166237
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	7.200676192319434
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	8.523485256829606
Still no matter what the cause is from...	11.832261214176182
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	7.824233256867773
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	8.97113827498315
She is a bad merchant.	14.331639260212267
She buys dear and sells cheap.	9.401035923706242
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	7.908576889399252
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	7.108109720436171
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	9.58788833355353
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	9.12514002671803
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	8.848054755950212
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	8.748373460576438
Do you?	18.69240581309966
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	8.509989079058883
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	6.9014083064175695
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	7.003409362196201
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	13.819879367200791
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	9.029165159423929
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	8.247267255816375
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	6.322192226710943
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	6.836241250112151
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	7.631841339788279
I ’ m not so sure about that.	10.303400672214202
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	7.380434238433734
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	8.049815626461958
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	12.680194225929643
Let me stir it.	13.539976040834455
And take a piece of that bun.	13.913619504021256
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	9.52086493802332
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	11.499543442982095
Try a bit.	19.93024664995299
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	9.537051499569575
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	6.253109417248662
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	8.006607821040104
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	9.767586821162055
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	7.974520490788692
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	6.343049501242853
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	9.425118538664961
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	6.644789544634165
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	7.157827275534995
You ought to eat more solid food.	10.804613083986041
You would feel a different man.	13.006940777137924
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	9.72178461909212
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	9.385105600066062
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	13.6903474337079
It reminds me of Roman history.	12.70457934763149
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	6.494060710483991
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	7.196677953533027
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	7.559402538840699
Look at him.	16.904531566927133
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	7.878361012495569
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	8.182217615835317
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	5.666228194652456
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	6.456684187770798
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	5.746774566115937
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	6.797036006537632
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	12.129227090831776
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	9.778949552497773
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	9.522511906479089
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	6.875095361898353
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	10.178017784313756
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	6.2290688865594905
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	6.382330880685073
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	6.791817990883163
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	10.038589254635381
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	11.499878906095432
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	7.786829622021412
She has the Spanish type.	14.147475725886068
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	10.78712925950496
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	7.287541621098783
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	10.044944433144579
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	9.196087944037648
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	8.634562674863263
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	12.576188787163018
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	6.423787152582012
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	11.140777849211043
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	10.962790750071118
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	9.782537194002458
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	8.913359314038718
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	9.079082003069864
An exception here and there.	13.141138314991764
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	11.843419248183558
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	9.45136568701081
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	9.960594974829514
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	8.134343091817334
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	12.684023973817633
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	7.959933507672234
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	6.830426042410298
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	6.169505695186358
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	11.58903451910199
s.	12.414448297259668
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	6.749366510065826
No aid was given.	15.9739492229294
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	9.770388946723903
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	12.825923113782615
At this stage an incident happened.	9.713103697107876
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	7.917784248191108
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	8.517777082734623
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	8.493438174238838
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	7.5829556602417005
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	6.429739130401316
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	6.731706580180474
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	6.565797528065847
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	6.09937149599638
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	7.741437255967654
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	8.06506670648787
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	7.714758994745565
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	7.7380448206110986
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	8.066779517055807
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	6.603764765368967
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	8.077234137020575
— Am I right, skipper?	11.650626923964468
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	9.60864431511279
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	6.609047355643089
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	8.397370119769542
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	6.2980382380373285
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	6.4140359122256445
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	10.368893975415899
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	8.231931489564248
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	6.93552549481125
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	12.447724020735997
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	12.047966294377138
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	6.596968296588523
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	8.900189626317339
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	10.308856402566649
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	9.353089269841021
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	6.164665601894221
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	6.3810574875497545
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	6.548671312858153
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	11.641628609275847
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	5.301368898590067
And the best jumpers and racers?	9.316617501992178
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	9.19385232763115
Tell me that.	20.992299547716577
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	6.8197152254857345
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	10.145468815796956
The Irish catholic peasant.	13.250348428710653
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	9.747970742874863
You know Jem Mullins?	11.20014513711514
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	6.654070299309346
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	7.445219359621156
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	6.624800084314805
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	7.389872843287704
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	7.506565234743557
And now, why?	17.479606384550117
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	8.212761664547159
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	7.311074246239198
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	7.1868337255242505
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	6.966890344805903
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	8.315182387201954
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	8.587765430988233
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	7.010821179834643
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	7.933359183380728
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	8.422986410296037
s.	12.414448297259668
d.	28.049926376197103
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	7.072023914425106
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	8.595168506264018
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	7.7686687720169765
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	11.885023868962348
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	10.122824718897935
A soft answer turns away wrath.	9.915379104263407
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	12.428759438327198
Am I not right?	15.855033195718645
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	7.555348408921855
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	6.236751362279845
— Of course, Mr B.	12.427128770960225
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	10.379418510937557
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	7.56325625223078
But with a little goodwill all round.	12.72119917117712
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	7.601703268964567
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	7.4344251378828465
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	8.954363955576055
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	8.997505784944702
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	8.903370972708531
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	6.149508999753274
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	12.283090909738423
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	11.46648028293663
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	6.9044806608546025
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	7.040196595858368
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	8.199357195671622
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	8.142257876653591
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	6.386265273080232
Why?	18.42545846291693
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	10.724495209836373
They are practical and are proved to be so.	10.226236600210251
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	8.346002485096202
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	7.520110335036965
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	9.34892389388127
Turks.	51.72916675838559
It ’ s in the dogma.	11.94399575773401
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	10.69554995188801
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	8.689634586038267
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	6.233032389271678
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	6.888367703903704
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	14.092640780144968
I call that patriotism.	15.596057441256537
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	6.207960497191835
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	12.834910475161028
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	8.224810616575214
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	7.949733939699168
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	11.171495724651054
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	8.822789638584538
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	8.232375231210636
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	10.54784290107637
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	8.720339652629525
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	9.037514354469984
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	8.868702966261232
That ’ s work too.	13.469812890501323
Important work.	23.44484403433201
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	8.698926593569501
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	8.135853368971466
What?	14.626800461768257
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	10.62060543865581
Each is equally important.	13.456146884891181
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	8.107884832507683
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	10.621848470786087
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	7.937218805455451
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	6.792530615297305
Excuse me.	20.5595928257355
What was it you...?	17.854448829253947
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	7.689486955554808
Let us change the subject.	14.819874345988923
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	8.889433262649868
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	10.261066724179951
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	7.357923036887553
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	7.764457413614398
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	6.794158773628354
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	6.884288026409821
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	6.65368153744117
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	7.048372586361035
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	6.605036875621545
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	9.28094790733631
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	10.893987598406085
With brains, sir.	14.439862220629959
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	8.007641918862912
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	5.185120358363588
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	9.72078876645897
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	7.106355908564251
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	8.020541673291415
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	7.057578894661402

Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.	10.345625928944653
— There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	10.693157267586985
— Who?	12.696584449771581
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	9.951368686217691

Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses.	10.97857166390233
Dead he wasn ’ t.	12.92467575207179
Simply absconded somewhere.	13.877817932112164
The coffin they brought over was full of stones.	9.983571548784703
He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	8.825731823177525
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	11.196300148479432
And so forth and so on.	12.52576663046186
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	7.303855336722858
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	8.39663586597728
Something evidently riled them in his death.	11.855031392613897
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	5.982690391469722
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	5.689140775396399
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	7.207165679370266
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	7.528287079984825
And the identical same with murderers.	9.540544785754985
You had to come back.	16.921049028759985
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	9.696808952300463
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	8.337044903729085
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	6.890255644310597
Still as regards return.	12.781316278710399
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	8.75923582205334
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	7.686687924124932
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	7.451085196592203
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	8.721116983396382
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	9.216568799166657
She put the first nail in his coffin.	11.768462815903641
— Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi - disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	8.276374129396299
She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	13.847935035413004
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	9.85852279936606
The husband was a captain or an officer.	11.483348360630739
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	8.329847217020546
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	6.736800823982801
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	7.456010395202489
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	6.406686165957816
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	6.645659351668818
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	7.357055821730356
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	8.585099539243972
Poser.	44.80800061837366
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	7.691250316793724
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	6.78108992042098
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	9.597942479794542
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	8.341283910922561
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	8.972614811229523
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	6.740340213357599
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	11.327734557511961
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	10.794880071040412
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	7.284107359567996
— Was she?	17.149225276124824
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	8.828629220748631
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	13.347752666373555
So, Spain.	16.72851395123727
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	8.22348036222943
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	10.013458733663988
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	7.340482980168371
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	8.430303566346065
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	8.020868857441963
Taken a few years since.	15.06464707845226
In or about ninety six.	11.538488435623455
Very like her then.	17.093951117822197
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	7.151849221507692
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	9.169528837627917
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	8.612330306902379
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	8.621574422451161
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	12.03609483066216
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	6.127929973129091
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	10.137319445200639
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	7.715015542433117
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	9.962216687457804
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	8.187762613705624
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	8.030254926498047
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	6.113391660228406
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	7.6420590274321745
Suppose she was gone when he?	14.574629957141918
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	6.6315338729413105
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	8.013621616961041
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	10.011320172075957
And why not?	19.048980892501884
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	6.36307762111991
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	7.50740380012264
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	6.365624140619098
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	6.848389687226642
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	6.80135701949415
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	7.676552038148253
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	6.750145100227669
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	6.544719532634589
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	6.808547522276247
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	6.287266809482693
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	7.825360406204747
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	6.422498260913405
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	9.648625006415632
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	7.142166122548545
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	9.643513842260523
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	8.261983300413494
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	9.219070976796315
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	8.487122836383579
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	5.829072560735465
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	6.059939354038206
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	9.64809212334797
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	9.724301874111143
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	9.084610496356973
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	8.662971366716835
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	8.163552401749905
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	6.3095238705142345
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	5.8080061416941025
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	7.820950645380881
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	8.386243504690505
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	8.340355646035254
Your god was a jew.	15.207470769631351
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	7.485740246541118
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	7.2373774359594405
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	10.975217980491044
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	12.031646026830456
Do you like cocoa?	15.231243376211564
Wait.	16.117996620458218
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	9.697201709809125
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	6.85375615512587
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	8.557941119165099
An opening was all was wanted.	13.484395463618352
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	9.386987649991912
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	7.656743924251959
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	6.928376450122413
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	8.28994270664139
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	7.5959910585632615
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	8.20333796078278
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	8.989692616771393
— Are you bad in the eyes?	12.852914543999644
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	7.188751200169526
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	7.624358470732173
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	11.39306392510728
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	12.250123746178703
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	5.481746706107154
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	6.885825229074326
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	8.41603534933607
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	6.370803723019392
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	8.568909556207625
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	10.196580983005552
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	9.317975304553395
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	7.388248778222713
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	8.455823698584195
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	8.875202443397413
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	11.30418032655377
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	11.107750377555584
Come.	22.108245157254114
It ’ s not far.	14.887520459748087
Lean on me.	18.980935234614172
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	11.79386094771893
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	8.395037729508621
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	8.895765166397993
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	7.227258706672244
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	6.597227317927747
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	8.62083006879594
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	6.861912312235156
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	6.706416590571495
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	6.665390867182298
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	8.799961598099683
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	6.738890010262984
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	8.223260177833831
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	6.008820366964947
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	6.079955375083737
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	6.000069389342597
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	9.089306214084647
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	7.509354886946646
Beware of the steamroller.	13.872335820327933
They thereupon stopped.	13.538761600328193
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	6.912439315029683
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	9.961022452176733
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	10.079403779540757
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	7.2911474462841985
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	7.4281721508551435
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	6.364832284386629
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	7.964414566255981
— What ’ s this I was saying?	13.242775524067673
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	7.572591000602204
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	7.824249690222391
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	7.652630339673394
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	5.495917718557565
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	5.4830696630228815
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	8.37484586959488
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	10.820407968539332
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	5.953027056542625
A.	12.93983968749198
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	6.583971083231835
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	8.653876402337845
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	6.5867157254787445
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	5.901121577063203
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	5.479193822835907
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	7.531596681241172
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	7.025113056496922
The horse was just then.	15.065425436286315
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	6.422985487707773
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	6.733385366042335
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	10.49594977839255
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	7.7831281258171146
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	7.6675877601634035
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	9.19420845601561
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	7.848649799651973
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	7.29353632765326
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	11.186160475661605
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	6.629058024260611
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	6.315819340636437
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	8.179065947764366
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	6.387574231739191
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	5.960205631426139
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	5.709679361927015
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	7.489664108736371
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	4.543932701364672
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	5.492581682166611
Were their views on some points divergent?	10.705170154781063
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	6.977454419795331
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	5.5331047824909305
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	5.201842456553751
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	9.157188294581704
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	7.059893574057516
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	8.172698720300566
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	6.492767709274304
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	6.377343393044667
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	5.389174164478263
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	7.319123617571955
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	8.739372929632028
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	7.3652335392511254
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	5.679706244814075
As in what ways?	13.06008548275982
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	7.5532871752070605
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	7.526841105716683
Was it there?	22.222335265278485
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	9.378056084312565
Why was he doubly irritated?	11.521138743440307
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	9.524706619782934
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	7.1129122571063625
To enter or not to enter.	15.5444260682782
To knock or not to knock.	15.751469715600988
Bloom ’ s decision?	16.63485394446427
A stratagem.	20.4185500985028
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	6.514201739361739
Did he fall?	18.155031676627292
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	5.676435919223511
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	8.72438592450814
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	7.465097355717389
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	7.643678791775195
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	12.2806499713285
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	5.783044793288261
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	9.446350799634816
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	11.9397795783623
Did Stephen obey his sign?	11.540024030182915
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	7.324796894388117
What did Bloom do?	15.50533797914099
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	5.471523324824861
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	9.844106151907372
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	7.539298989540273
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	9.069261145860711
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	5.219384505813267
What did Bloom see on the range?	11.813113583775179
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	7.1432402722744675
What did Bloom do at the range?	12.312537502749105
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	7.319303630179455
Yes.	14.818606210850463
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	5.039465225690154
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	5.910437947350986
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	7.588019081636336
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	4.1913443283003655
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	7.362516774482209
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	6.1267284527146515
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	9.143840785575787
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	5.68452973607919
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	5.736427582475905
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	6.484661394861957
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	7.656517940020753
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	6.0479609314473555
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	10.384517133994764
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	8.092856952822354
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	8.98275224414167
The phenomenon of ebullition.	11.933020032772925
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	4.617567222846868
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	5.9780301305449575
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	8.647910559306428
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	7.182805959757681
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	7.900088801563508
To shave himself.	17.230933679400025
What advantages attended shaving by night?	10.5167548306868
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	5.155183787134058
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	8.698259623775346
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	7.114180208167672
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	9.4857550606349
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	6.308297021838026
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	7.626506337968343
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	5.387199805527058
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	5.995455277023705
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	9.645605694747527
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	7.098825983317189
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	9.64629325028854
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	6.593962991698125
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	7.405039956319526
In Bernard Kiernan ’ s licensed premises <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street: in David Byrne ’ s licensed premises, <NUM> Duke street: in O ’ Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon ’ s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	7.3208145896078785
W.	26.858432004718157
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	7.918138544434453
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	6.398562315525606
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	7.938107650326549
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	5.0442920643241616
His mood?	24.36329166392028
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	11.758469261532012
What satisfied him?	17.707757609734582
To have sustained no positive loss.	9.61571851863375
Light to the gentiles.	16.964870946534578
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	8.824210221552402
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	6.223423144488414
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	8.230269450976667
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	7.406526489714988
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	8.570355323184083
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	7.001672856390183
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	6.551226956222715
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	9.227989652662727
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	10.178561241106259
Who drank more quickly?	15.745053455097775
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	7.163167715319789
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	8.245702663375763
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	5.977891054373883
Had he found their solution?	12.922341075158704
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	6.882382291838702
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	7.884932647472034
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you ’ ll find room.	7.679081153909907
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	8.27226532854778
Bloom.	18.147734167807787
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	8.116025088039162
Name, age, race, creed.	11.093384148742773
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	12.599506495854545
Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob Bollopedoom Old Ollebo, M.	6.198872704927832
P.	14.020800208276315
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the <NUM> February <NUM>?	7.820844897739892
Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	6.317075100457055
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	8.60672469189289
Dearer far than song or wine.	11.226772120200074
You are mine.	14.851561922316979
The world is mine.	15.071684634974599
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	6.465557701843449
G.	31.326531239219992
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	6.858127478585367
Shelton <NUM> December <NUM>, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.	6.796071562766238
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?	4.966349510537941
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born <NUM>, acceded <NUM>) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist ’ s non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist ’ s revelations of white articles of non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody ’ s Book of Jokes_ (<NUM> pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	5.032313713140036
What relation existed between their ages?	11.092008978401187
<NUM> years before in <NUM> when Bloom was of Stephen ’ s present age Stephen was <NUM>.	11.882133257416742
<NUM> years after in <NUM> when Stephen would be of Bloom ’ s present age Bloom would be <NUM>.	10.800564903259849
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	7.176233542480717
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	6.954290281132537
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	8.69303113471662
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin ’ s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s father and Stephen ’ s granduncle, Stephen being then <NUM> years older.	8.603431466621094
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	7.906352281447376
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	6.036032864264592
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	7.993296109834699
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	7.534317215393837
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	8.956280068411846
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	5.1960243705036335
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	8.99123712390019
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	5.6665467896190505
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	8.28846080947917
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	5.383725742038755
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	6.887336343459917
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	5.448551490166457
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	8.782237725031889
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	5.747021056450121

Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	6.039201331754927
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	8.531680525538434
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	9.211995996441916
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	8.687220597171443
The scientific.	23.098645559638484
The artistic.	24.141868687942143
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	6.960717785105415
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	5.436936005716835
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	6.827354264281394

What?	14.626800461768257
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel.	6.691251790780238
Queen ’ s Ho...	12.533756415738067
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	8.906434256638459
The Queen ’ s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the <NUM> June <NUM>, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of <NUM> parts of aconite liniment to <NUM> of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at <URL> <URL>. on the morning of <NUM> June <NUM> at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, <NUM> Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at <URL> <URL>. on the afternoon of <NUM> June <NUM> a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, <NUM> Main street, Ennis.	7.12833330400693
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	6.024415095282923
Coincidence.	32.13850438451833
He preferred himself to see another ’ s face and listen to another ’ s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	7.949859383734574
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	6.691513617290547
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	4.674788618099443
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise <URL> <URL>., sunset <URL> <URL>. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	8.403124485070393
What to do with our wives.	13.291217419093542
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	8.55125766872346
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	4.15072135412001
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	7.042970048748314
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	6.951004978731339
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	6.886814736172169
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	6.736994323937508
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	5.693818875929851
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	4.3978656903121855
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	5.556865542422252
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	6.858418446749195
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	6.60390166192309
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	6.507038250103649
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	7.8007842178821525
Variously.	44.80800061837366
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other ’ s ignorant lapse.	6.792224555263601
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	9.51783436239693
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	6.7082187912948585
What system had proved more effective?	9.678092839191791
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	9.960294348628295
Example?	44.699101331895235
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	8.609894738955477
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest ’ s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	6.477160709718375
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	6.045935632988459
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	7.4657842457802674
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	7.182660425332521

By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	6.048211241922083
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m ’ baad l ’ zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	5.298928137629301
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	6.281746774206347
By juxtaposition.	20.230352158999235
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, and <NUM>.	5.9545602750928435
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	7.182840197974143
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	5.356974901070438
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	7.387300785736175
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar <NUM> years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	4.066339864616868
Mary ’ s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve ’ s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	5.589736316726848
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	5.41038018336719
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	8.934072200482941
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	8.414384872287204
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	9.616948335930237
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	7.439605496813759
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	4.728595192866108
Did the guest comply with his host ’ s request?	9.613363069032996

He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	7.432862184356745
What was Bloom ’ s visual sensation?	12.072441125362104
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	7.958774852945825
What were Stephen ’ s and Bloom ’ s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	8.078781646367691
Visually, Stephen ’ s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	4.881130212397285
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	11.180705534890153
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.	7.118835722546988

On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († <NUM>), exponent of Shakespeare.	5.412065470346421
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	7.018673319354374
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	5.850805427890931
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	9.231205246024963
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	9.303174706113804
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	7.6867859663084515
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew ’ s windows all.	8.299225073402097
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	11.145262366370142
With unmixed feeling.	14.540691532670403
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	10.959682364673874
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	10.690420586638606
Then out there came the jew ’ s daughter And she all dressed in green.	10.538693535748745
“ Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again. ” I can ’ t come back and I won ’ t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	9.366805927754326
For if my master he did hear He ’ d make it a sorry ball. ” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	7.9205425804207845
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	10.01120293612506
And now he ’ ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	9.661280213991528
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	10.3362988334392
With mixed feelings.	17.688138559521022
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew ’ s daughter, all dressed in green.	10.787334180286907
Condense Stephen ’ s commentary.	14.219348746310205
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	15.070771641366967
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	7.314547673059393
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	8.185009915400478
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	8.696889502250917
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	8.97008398482027
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	10.455382214089152
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	8.958537412909475
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	9.696946847822767
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	9.193141941458622
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	4.8720515473513295
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	7.9199832864346575
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	7.245388568603327
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	6.680762878591676
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	8.164527263539219
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	7.187378368299441
What other infantile memories had he of her?	11.53702794053619
<NUM> June <NUM>.	16.954977539739062
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	6.471274464100624
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	5.566813270796994
What endemic characteristics were present?	10.187802937975855
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	6.241851624208676
What memories had he of her adolescence?	12.418117539981266
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	7.244846342797909
On the duke ’ s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	6.570555802706172
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	6.819551931271874
On the vigil of the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).	7.187563624112882
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	7.577180569549813
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	11.800112665976089
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	8.124239969380971
A temporary departure of his cat.	11.626137324791044
Why similarly, why differently?	12.424354229895181
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	9.312038792933045
In other respects were their differences similar?	9.98443829733931
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	8.141557820065922
As?	31.20021540397746
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	7.333727756361965
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	5.553547447497413
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	6.539110431085606
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	7.447675946482789
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	7.859985408163688
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	5.4381653633309
In what manners did she reciprocate?	10.46054513326706
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	7.291263706236333
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	6.890234077218077
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	7.0821580190360915
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	8.602828214078906
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	6.248122926836684
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	7.5756337095926884
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	8.207036293681313
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	5.577931390179158
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	5.6933717303963
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	11.329760992597691
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	7.49804727455734

A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), <NUM> June <NUM>, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	7.50826890727334
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	9.934638382688249
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	7.2394600685894055
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	10.159271412081935
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ <NUM> <NUM>), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	9.096860674970594
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	4.704871273127319
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	6.9711851014869035
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	6.994376731479739
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, <NUM> Lower Abbey street (W.	6.152574464123909
and E.	12.375548898057787
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	7.19242689509685
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	6.453469348124191
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	6.922951484714332
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	7.581872721729152
and T.	10.187217039413008
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	6.196538680875579
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	14.996219356786602
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	11.819373104334566
Never.	30.184844722246797
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	7.723521493074021
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	5.492838775524789
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	6.548908021692522
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	4.716185895321932
Why did he desist from speculation?	9.455838518630348
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	7.481335138616691
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	9.911919218960692
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	10.208671338694778
Not verbally.	22.21665212131272
Substantially.	44.80800061837366
What comforted his misapprehension?	11.161661204726819
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	7.3736897877929595
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	7.508669634905892
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	4.899751045503742
What did each do at the door of egress?	12.205831863056483
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	12.548601119113824
Stephen put the hat on his head.	15.34015745995242
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	10.20095490176036
For a cat.	18.372836210736825
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	8.22662677260503
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	6.696917352358941
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	7.928843844668374
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	5.356293035485368
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	6.877884742743307
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	4.825617082313821
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	8.213877357303382
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	6.725319927830957
Of a different order of difficulty.	12.337146059487454
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	4.82732522993823
And the problem of possible redemption?	11.526939499206447
The minor was proved by the major.	10.108584813338926
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	10.137928727567767
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	4.557369050607324
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	6.081619616888268
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	9.164581104180026
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	10.489311659594614
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	6.21056663452579
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	8.934460959772167
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	5.30574324336218
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	6.26883873067507
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	5.677099325684773
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	10.224873317518345
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	5.287710727915697
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	10.712486138325707
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	6.1440961923258275
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	7.344483782772097
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	5.678304586562969
Both then were silent?	13.998492402650895
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	7.611947255502862
Were they indefinitely inactive?	10.402695346652
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	7.100004808063966
Similarly?	44.699101331895235
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	6.0070763949651855
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	7.788791880426197
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	5.278382677476471
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	5.485702244133246
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	9.938724216227788
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	5.006147881252834
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	6.617053601221544
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	5.306594922276226
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	13.481135071896562
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	7.970263331132049
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	6.715435641859794
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	9.699237111671938
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	8.643505631949626
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	11.001074206172706
Turma circumdet.	17.491345280693682
Iubilantium te virginum.	11.328658358168093
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	7.942084788782791
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	7.799023793333132
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	9.810519340704621
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	16.06513200260664
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	7.017938482692856
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	16.114550995276687
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	4.807514061404505
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	5.986452351557484
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	5.792530519901553
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	5.778335685318605
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	10.382979744360965
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	7.745299916228304
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	10.608567864790752
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	7.916516202308666
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	10.593754491884912
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	6.674272324719492
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	6.00205047144144
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	6.635008913341337
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	10.814274763913799
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	5.743134412773488
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	7.895061460922402
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	6.276668668951128
Describe them.	23.556507860314294
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	5.5845863608287365
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	6.178545826832909
What significances attached to these two chairs?	9.663495959350925

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	7.530501093638762
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	5.342190270696884
His next proceeding?	16.114904033963256
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	6.140943109680281
What followed this operation?	12.965721401868025

Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	5.0542022760847605
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	8.819008608910972

Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	10.795391847963582
Brothers and sisters had he none.	11.732250440565224
Yet that man ’ s father was his grandfather ’ s son.	12.845222127263872

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?	7.389617911802251
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	8.64037992653491
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.	6.206931932920949
As?	31.20021540397746
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	4.771422007263836
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	9.093750918127421
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.	7.244142387627793

Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	5.798322440068008
Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	6.189304780430394
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	7.120582284164657
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.	6.884528286325637
What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?	7.374744932453267

What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	9.280908078635195
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.	7.7399338878480055

With which attendant indignities?	12.001256850428293
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	5.087326476026552
By what could such a situation be precluded?	10.408072219715987

What considerations rendered departure not irrational?	8.49676313505424
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.	5.870283552994767

Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall.	5.815119552328941
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.	5.197355288561241

Bloom ’ s acts?	17.18547028219081
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	7.162893954178278
How?	26.762088021875993
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	5.924734943684242
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	8.611351856421678
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	7.094624295017868
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	11.128594263067342
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	7.34941401149766
What preceding series?	18.218109708037872
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	5.9192910852234935
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	9.882138181427749
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	6.64060401611739
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	6.447353589645735
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	5.985074832984602
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	7.400591815518885
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	8.699891553256839
Envy?	44.632274217224825
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	5.040666255407732
Jealousy?	44.699101331895235
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	6.877882534377048
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	5.665947136611637
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	6.941820030682434
Abnegation?	44.699101331895235
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	4.484304765983932
Equanimity?	44.699101331895235
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	6.610791752806624
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	7.692129986299849
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	4.088708671450588
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	4.889676440642194
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	10.353384697885197
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	7.497352542569392
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	5.609420702597977
What retribution, if any?	14.870826201445356
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	9.719347515031862
Duel by combat, no.	12.27556347047895
Divorce, not now.	17.73604256685563
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	6.420900827232254
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	5.818837224804377
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	10.506818851726587
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	4.939279242004048
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	7.21329629499405
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	4.6425201725955425
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	6.131910783389489
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	5.089590563740223
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	10.343835549947922
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	6.768622957421256
Then?	38.96346278172838
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	5.556218988535681
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	10.343835549947922
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	6.540428077923235
What followed this silent action?	11.659367439653398
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.	5.438737745326543
With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?	9.918491527515151
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown.	6.519040692308686

Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?	7.731972628884651
Absolutely.	47.12018689325502
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?	8.592837478389164

<NUM> October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born <NUM> June <NUM>, having been anticipatorily consummated on the <NUM> September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place <NUM> weeks previous, viz.	6.943982904195751
<NUM> November <NUM>, to the birth on <NUM> December <NUM> of second (and only male) issue, deceased <NUM> January <NUM>, aged <NUM> days, there remained a period of <NUM> years, <NUM> months and <NUM> days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.	7.293325954173352
By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, <NUM> September <NUM>, there remained a period of <NUM> months and <NUM> day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	6.190923398002119
How?	26.762088021875993
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.	7.834527940263154
What moved visibly above the listener ’ s and the narrator ’ s invisible thoughts?	9.76548261278637

• Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that

damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes

loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were <NUM> of us goodbye to my sleep for this

wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that

the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only <NUM> or <NUM> Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM> st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I

couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	7.241110680626622
