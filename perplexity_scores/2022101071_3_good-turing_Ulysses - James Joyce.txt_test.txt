A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	18.46537067282468
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	115.43961653885209
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	11.290505882745997
You saved men from drowning.	9.983526557654004
The scrotumtightening sea.	12.026967024177692
There is something sinister in you....	12.191895003833725
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	18.84542804238071
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	7.1120013705653955
Buck Mulligan answered.	78.72658064941223
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	5.6054404579231365
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	6.043648835161509
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	3.4998933735604676
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	5.597281744103437
A servant too.	13.494326808327182
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	13.464645168724301
he said.	401.7011151401686
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	47.19562372723043
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	3.577743956838613
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	41.00601820519072
What did you say that for?	230.66218046409406
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	5.761801739561264
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	8.24707817148297
Brief exposure.	1.4596908026901914
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	3.4077852254055663
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	24.983867536016035
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	41.79102512734809
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	48.67077562288363
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	46.81829494667126
— Go on then, Talbot.	16.844889208762186
My father gave me seeds to sow.	8.503925590005336
Ask me, sir.	103.79478159545101
— Again, sir.	57.450239502412806
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	14.452663197903032
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	18.62515252666825
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	3.792625151577387
Mr Deasy is calling you.	12.964470365147506
— What is it now?	1076.3712816921354
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	4.890088234103199
Money is power.	4.635018605722063
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	24.63417277602341
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	21.50392910414337
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	4.194123663086188
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	21.526206435797583
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	1.6173203546380897
Serum and virus.	1.4596908026901914
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	27.40292659292852
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	2.8269338515383224
I am, a stride at a time.	26.238056199513725
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	41.39295134475289
Yes, I must.	973.8899002171929
Lump of love.	2.5238066732075044
It lowers.	23.393935954751427
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	1.9376073808691594
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	34.432389171684534
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	2.913192582816473
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	30.02673253376788
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	1.732908166436056
_Fermé_.	1.4596908026901911
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	10.380368112970082
She serves me at his beck.	6.360792483812627
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	4.573968006483002
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	1.4596908026901914
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	53.97086947027741
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	5.816124454700616
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	15.076149710312972
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	7.069969878838501
Open hallway.	46.23372335448224
In. Come.	231.57770890501013
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	10.161744571593747
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	26.871599317298596
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	26.823284989998857
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	28.806190764807006
Welcome as the flowers in May.	1.4596908026901914
My ashplant will float away.	9.25903057485874
I shall wait.	12.652483425520119
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	4.043419474558802
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	6.530778638685413
The coals were reddening.	7.43013834129692
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	41.8466947244418
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	21.99457934696986
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	4.257652585936324
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	9.691429521856312
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	5.9680924452915445
Not there.	35.52210879390343
Makes you feel young.	34.42949916406134
Getting on to sundown.	30.246491677610067
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	35.10624793869633
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	30.805492345474644
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	2.59237077554847
For you, please?	10.828260698620504
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	17.40957133197867
Still an idea behind it.	13.833549670801313
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	180.90662436052207
Yes, yes.	900.1056412565904
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	4.080421103707135
Here.	216.12647889293197
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	3.1000953293321096
Only five she was then.	10.28132668357535
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	20.80934741393835
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	22.35182381369289
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	7.938890027294131
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	22.973586239375926
C.	213.99259247746502
— Here, she said.	254.4911101557688
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	249.52564753147232
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	5.643811761359389
Illustration.	1.4596908026901911
An example?	1186.3142401842174
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	47.31891902465746
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	15.392632082522022
Byby.	725.7284551372614
Of course it might.	26.036192239538437
Vain: very.	41.32805803031864
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	7.100768092898922
Useless: can ’ t move.	3.3118585227736133
Virginia creepers.	1.4596908026901914
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	3.8974541861625553
Nobody.	16.740590691709745
Invent a story for some proverb.	1.4596908026901914
<URL>.	498.5117221938163
Her head dancing.	19.096507456683433
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	7.767432378258946
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	14.329391003417234
Singing with his eyes shut.	214.00234760386945
In the dark.	395.78247843464356
No - one.	133.58547315545061
Eyes front.	47.022788421621705
Hair?	256.73049712696394
no trouble I hope?	32.54749070534347
I see you ’ re...	155.05781554850384
Having a wet.	4.764780844735748
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	9.179926121046698
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	156.19045142466618
Like to see her again in that.	65.24127970779725
Rachel, is it?	2.6931762877230514
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	8.051654311940098
Ruins and tenements.	1.4596908026901914
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	32.19753140863692
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	31.290890240171922

Perfectly right that is.	164.3152912789946
Palestrina for example too.	1.6615620683112882
Eunuch.	1.4596908026901911
Look down at her ring to find an excuse.	4.673205333399389

Aq. Dist.	1.4596908026901914
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	2.9989612463505844
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	374.31298649220736
How much are they?	21.684447402963233
To look younger.	18.53712176756684
Regular hotbed of it lately.	17.766896003159335
College sports today I see.	2.07117070903832
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	3.814396911364433
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	2.8990669108659977
He was alone.	96.76090166798217
Great card he was.	63.79295129160543
His name stinks all over Dublin.	28.59523561314894
Mr Power asked.	106.4642572475719
Gasworks.	1.4596908026901911
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	7.3094356955458935
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	8.107886530286688
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	44.53264428241936
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	22.18829654040228
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	118.66300716551167
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	583.1781346857199
What causes that?	14.706971114036296
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	16.751313869042367
And _Madame_.	20.23149659569806
Or the Moira, was it?	49.42340891902805
— About the boatman?	218.13858435033285
Mr Power asked.	106.4642572475719
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	423.3934136213917
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	458.28104288476237
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	9.959148615907772
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	14.897766259476429
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	35.644608626586766
Very encouraging.	38.59792317311553
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	6.1068843985355965
— What ’ s wrong now?	247.0802918390178
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	30.510201321887273
— Why?	4038.772848964433
Terrible! — First round Dunphy ’ s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	58.59933238612725

Ned Lambert says he ’ ll try to get one of the girls into Todd ’ s.	17.214319474029523
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	3.8585840259833377
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	3.4191917846179574
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	21.41004092565365
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	1.4596908026901914
Eh?	196.96504069019625
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	22.690159151004615
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	402.73419668587724
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	32.54749070534347
All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells.	5.538348155820648

— L, Mr Bloom said.	72.14382468020976
And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	45.64385556929649
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	22.33774330713495
We have time.	107.29337642339475
More interesting if they told you what they were.	8.040393213576321
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.	9.26939096701831
Faithful departed.	1.4596908026901914
As you are now so once were we.	12.88368805450666
After dinner on a Sunday.	20.115177894705262
Flies come before he ’ s well dead.	16.768981574843444

Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	3.3124307180359995
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	4.719846555013882
Way out.	523.1983436929837

More Irish than the Irish.	18.712732133277147
Hynes asked.	96.01926145795566
This ad, you see.	16.799502039453245
Then here the name.	162.34330906798857
You know the usual.	52.45485169159473
Highclass licensed premises.	2.6283702569915137
NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	4.4182208755172905
a voice asked from the castingbox.	21.28919748336006
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	6.14682305834142
How quickly he does that job.	15.460512665584824
Pop in a minute to phone.	2.9380687196709783
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	3.7405128128194147
Bladderbags.	1.4596908026901911

— Well.	1279.9428536612284
_ — That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... _ — O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	5.781926439680569
No, twenty...	38.31269517026681
J.	129.7375304578709
It was at the royal university dinner.	11.254991314914458

Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now.	2.175751961172569

The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen ’ s and Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s loose ties.	41.17896132332151
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	27.518033861247996

How do you know?	24.34997497510696
Silence! Pause.	48.27828517205691

In Mooney ’ s _en ville_ and in Mooney ’ s _sur <URL> He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.	2.4723119447336153
He looked towards the saloon door.	21.086479451918294

O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	6.462139904873272
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	1.888164541290974
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	19.687159500856264
Clock whirred.	96.01926145795566
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	2.8640276192467415
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	4.5071483555341825
I was only vamping, man.	42.33994123176161
His gouty paws plumped chords.	8.167683917900348
What?	1560.489681896445
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: — _When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	3.2566448846591576

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	6.334201704634453
Look at this, says he.	96.05938557371054
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	9.287462644875191
And he started laughing.	45.003211593172566
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	20.04690124726519
says I.	589.3102590128412
The tear is bloody near your eye.	5.550306295810446
— _...	475.0648350030777
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	83.6456297027917
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	13.541571899387968
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	5.566298305202924
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	7.839381449472524
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	2.0928636743430062
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	4.573927478830339
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	6.026181177324265
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	6.140731106558528
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	5.272890638381552
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	2.5419334348809857
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	138.75592959001708
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	10.315123776216447
True as you ’ re there.	124.05617808755552

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	57.817856083926

— Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	34.7931935323183
It was a knockout clean and clever.	18.383153551482636
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	77.11003018140384
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	3.7670019718183294
J.	129.7375304578709
Look at his head.	272.60294370854893
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	72.58822914822943
What?	1560.489681896445
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	9.189902898958833
And J.	25.66257128706876
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	4.14021161998205
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	5.940707949064696
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	5.009973013751184
— Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	19.479281690186742
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	3.2777349905931374
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	8.22345140052698
Aren ’ t they trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay ’ s dinnerparty with perfidious Albion?	2.561458256588945
Firebrands of Europe and they always were.	4.1684688929369464
There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	12.667109332354133
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	7.470589048048551
— That covers my case, says Joe.	25.193687616424963
I was born here.	105.86048807241282
— And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	24.23989788741948

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	22.239929375267295
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	4.270996465270256
— Who made those allegations?	46.12623236038978
says Alf.	90.63091556479291
J., when he ’ s quite sure which country it is.	14.591931537117059

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	4.039254513151111
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	14.541825487720562

Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	30.955144955848056
— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	11.565485355323851
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	37.28988700136941
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	3.901573643900508
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	2.798693137796687
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	4.007976883606452
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	4.162352311658038
The colours were done something lovely.	5.451357525503078
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	4.15790258253615
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	2.330313319504189
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	6.397272899615485
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	2.691899600107799
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	7.075450475597305
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	19.56630079623654
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	2.677294392870592
Sister?	13.553989839292583
Cheap too.	96.01926145795566
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	72.55381292060572
And I ’ ll write to you.	494.13463712172427
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	5.055481307491764
All are.	135.069294227069
Took off her hat to show her hair.	25.835132632594746
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she ’ s on for it: good evening.	12.004612866499668
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	10.161744571593747
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	6.243516681558574
Cause of half the trouble.	1.6310979464215127
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	5.4752309084643125
Fifteen she told me.	20.59184331457428
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	5.83689911779841
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	3.8316204208674653
Neat way she carries parcels too.	16.506124814996312
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	3.4561082461544355
Keeps them out of harm ’ s way.	163.35793804087564
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	6.841565684060308
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	11.838852682218933
Big he and little she.	10.57178848405128
Tip.	644.5508818121558
For instance if you go into a cellar where it ’ s dark.	13.040070317926645
Vamp of her stockings.	1.6615620683112882
Wonder where it is really.	29.34269742107548
Animals go by that.	1.6635683796903198
Ask yourself who is he now.	7.3709644097813705
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	13.040699208516639
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	202.31769222719018
Old Betty ’ s joints are on the rack.	6.210759258692462
And distant hills seem coming nigh.	6.599757637607632
Bailey light.	1.7727374436617647
No. Wait.	89.03094472837438
All quiet on Howth now.	8.498990064069403
O wait.	29.977756866051955
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	10.431277581233854
Bat probably.	186.84201005381993
Their frugal meal.	22.249261776292265
Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.	3.0680537673525388
Say you never see them with three colours.	5.825727456595982
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	33.900988704828606
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	12.033267147126358
And says she and says he.	27.474649739492634
Calomel purge I got her for that.	1.7932740757443215

Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion.	1.7051700997808132
Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	12.444150035330042
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	14.851895503867055
Hopeless.	725.7284551372614
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	20.57886794736456
Might be money.	26.95696847427206
Must come back.	563.8059584398546
What?	1560.489681896445
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	5.0746107255845425
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	9.659298731170683
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	2.522123990577892
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	2.444565885018693
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	37.8680801049842
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	2.589681702772585
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	2.5133981586059306
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	2.222360460127708
He ’ ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that ’ s Irish, says he.	14.1391241180013
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	15.382754487277838
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	5.066777691507124
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.	3.1671523488128743
