176.48142498275695
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	16.337693352445953
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	22.564155018445987
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	7.9502789071335025
You saved men from drowning.	6.098294440671464
The scrotumtightening sea.	8.860282504533899
There is something sinister in you....	6.303730077032013
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	10.170183057959205
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	6.053885420775846
Buck Mulligan answered.	31.671055276449557
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	3.495278136132148
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	3.0517346870551703
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	1.1598024893558696
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	2.182365873582777
A servant too.	9.95020486213359
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	1.428329452961925
he said.	141.38141645313658
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	4.16156996912731
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	1.600777347432946
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	5.8066780946492775
What did you say that for?	16.36444970673711
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	4.596920136986188
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	3.1601095515073014
Brief exposure.	1.1598024893558696
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	1.51668217605023
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	5.277189422366308
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	6.11906700236877
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	21.099572531877087
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	6.876817136791406
— Go on then, Talbot.	13.358994746697293
My father gave me seeds to sow.	7.76958081924238
Ask me, sir.	14.138163327811586
— Again, sir.	11.314968879216414
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	3.317027078520429
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	4.59354079105233
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	3.113012950495543
Mr Deasy is calling you.	11.023233181234959
— What is it now?	132.01117523260717
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	1.9773026696827898
Money is power.	3.896436629724649
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	4.258275513477236
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	4.641228810377468
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	3.234164984549731
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	6.979041350309066
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	1.1598024893558696
Serum and virus.	1.1598024893558696
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	20.992572787254158
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	2.107051466504232
I am, a stride at a time.	10.866187610354668
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	9.648065914429479
Yes, I must.	49.617573880117725
Lump of love.	1.1598024893558696
It lowers.	20.574860421464113
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	1.1598024893558696
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	8.286020353835314
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	1.1598024893558696
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	7.259011713658913
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	1.1598024893558696
_Fermé_.	1.1598024893558696
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	7.0017205050623
She serves me at his beck.	4.824723204260872
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	3.778208911680809
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	1.1598024893558696
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	12.051888280870406
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	4.8617683945730175
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	5.129231990002198
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	5.523571835843302
Open hallway.	34.62739726602871
In. Come.	191.29328253084537
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	8.720207982934454
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	2.2429029217509613
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	4.934228719595473
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	9.558984487948008
Welcome as the flowers in May.	1.1598024893558696
My ashplant will float away.	6.946750105693916
I shall wait.	9.321465667293642
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	3.34191048633062
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	4.541568290700906
The coals were reddening.	6.31350187608415
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	2.9000143604402915
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	5.295377446393797
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	3.270620248114828
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	2.9601679776090752
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	2.7342184755772876
Not there.	25.714475553992447
Makes you feel young.	31.49424831186325
Getting on to sundown.	31.49424831186325
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	6.152827806940148
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	24.7021121199037
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	2.1091555253706247
For you, please?	9.219231991068588
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	8.73509906165499
Still an idea behind it.	7.146200003243129
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	5.812632811216149
Yes, yes.	1432.2304262004454
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	1.1598024893558696
Here.	397.95024084096895
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	2.5406996404676705
Only five she was then.	7.789449593428521
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	7.226630774249446
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	13.118890805985226
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	3.985666455355528
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	6.239079719880532
C.	417.9052384715969
— Here, she said.	74.55756897169913
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	8.351972230590535
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	4.9509315550396575
Illustration.	1.1598024893558696
An example?	1541.181253964798
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	13.625018909761993
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	3.5586691891055717
Byby.	965.7396422239158
Of course it might.	23.60296633557211
Vain: very.	36.77150442043809
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	6.020734124537863
Useless: can ’ t move.	2.4734963543465494
Virginia creepers.	1.1598024893558696
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	2.8752246328011166
Nobody.	37.73746414034323
Invent a story for some proverb.	1.1598024893558696
<URL>.	445.34151401366177
Her head dancing.	14.114393998611268
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	2.441372770822275
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	2.6509558363788535
Singing with his eyes shut.	12.022508286807458
In the dark.	307.52695630224264
No - one.	303.1392705001233
Eyes front.	34.62739726602871
Hair?	236.35259143772853
no trouble I hope?	33.46740565267862
I see you ’ re...	24.582639657606244
Having a wet.	3.896436629724649
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	7.9863071493796065
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	30.57343273415702
Like to see her again in that.	12.046639732269865
Rachel, is it?	1.5747570178354309
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	5.2404392230089725
Ruins and tenements.	1.1598024893558696
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	32.641152583558465
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	18.362431958557146

Perfectly right that is.	33.46740565267862
Palestrina for example too.	1.1598024893558696
Eunuch.	1.1598024893558696
Look down at her ring to find an excuse.	3.8639907409535157

Aq. Dist.	1.1598024893558696
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	1.9807270225954006
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	91.4868704415088
How much are they?	16.458319578454347
To look younger.	13.694877378397782
Regular hotbed of it lately.	13.696760646003433
College sports today I see.	1.1598024893558696
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	3.143878906957257
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	1.1598024893558696
He was alone.	77.74513880401742
Great card he was.	11.222856151157616
His name stinks all over Dublin.	22.80493240104914
Mr Power asked.	110.79556327955336
Gasworks.	1.1598024893558696
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	6.1392656988019985
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	3.2339377781459717
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	7.210269131055963
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	4.755133104743395
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	132.80064898831458
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	66.43024225059614
What causes that?	10.842502939166797
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	4.869300893052594
And _Madame_.	17.783926770630664
Or the Moira, was it?	22.69024783603776
— About the boatman?	233.05010342763973
Mr Power asked.	110.79556327955336
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	121.29003691081343
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	7.655965037007044
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	7.153786305209802
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	7.259011713658913
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	5.800867144087989
Very encouraging.	34.52210375659331
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	4.338699688888766
— What ’ s wrong now?	126.44226878736224
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	4.414845217985861
— Why?	8356.138036681898
Terrible! — First round Dunphy ’ s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	6.314255925070659
Elixir of life.	1.1598024893558696

Ned Lambert says he ’ ll try to get one of the girls into Todd ’ s.	2.6064739212063426
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	3.2004943225949813
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	1.6467829800562923
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	25.52710114491274
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	1.1598024893558696
Eh?	373.70694353851286
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	22.425530116514665
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	20.564940600769116
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	33.46740565267862

And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	3.4561735372128846
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	16.062561028878086
We have time.	87.72034817924046
More interesting if they told you what they were.	8.008175003444848
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.	7.8918872177077315

Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	1.1598024893558696
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	1.9802496162146812

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	1.1598024893558696
a voice asked from the castingbox.	16.285007982556145
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	3.1727375442536108
How quickly he does that job.	5.3556765406636755
Pop in a minute to phone.	1.1598024893558696

_ — That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... _ — O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	1.7129478525735622
No, twenty...	21.982228161764095

That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	3.5829175245742455

O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	5.456184618541377
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	1.1598024893558696
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	14.457550337450845
Clock whirred.	69.4549769451071
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	1.1598024893558696
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	3.314323766647739
I was only vamping, man.	113.72854462472336
His gouty paws plumped chords.	6.155603352382291

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	2.9562195259240034
Look at this, says he.	19.52889314559435
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	5.556085374771935
And he started laughing.	36.12162056375066
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	6.976133492901213

The tear is bloody near your eye.	3.5890118155216943
— _...	791.3955546268766
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	5.459104541562125
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	2.511599137649629
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	1.6383091358121957
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	1.3886630484794762
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	1.727783502668133
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	2.5992087434065314
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	4.214931218991021
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	1.7911185065375108
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	1.2204126932609627
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	1.1598024893558696
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	10.111941223777782
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	1.5852822545791485

It was a knockout clean and clever.	7.337282156454638
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	5.573802457116417
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	2.1371732318318566
J.	244.1848863975607
Look at his head.	36.8727970810589
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	14.765515176192388
What?	2342.5114089148965
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	2.4288108168064575
And J.	17.783926770630664
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	1.3026776342210227
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	4.525713642576121

There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	5.664006198042518
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	3.450247429657488
— That covers my case, says Joe.	16.036378799958428
I was born here.	36.75272106649759

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	3.4541075755468973
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	2.4019041352061556
— Who made those allegations?	40.303605713715925

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	1.7718725274556668
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	1.8566299422339223

— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	9.870253378173375
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	26.559632063365104
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	1.5935390615325262
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	2.284223248890121
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	1.4625831726187606
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	1.4212123052927577
The colours were done something lovely.	4.133317287976997
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	2.2995073692429315
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	1.4004430055156747
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	4.227256544704782
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	2.1140005645032156
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	1.4276972963457273
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	3.8347049699474396
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	1.4708399959113656
Sister?	30.114651215638453
Cheap too.	69.4549769451071
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	7.80189965453106
And I ’ ll write to you.	19.933626359357888

Took off her hat to show her hair.	8.720207982934454
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she ’ s on for it: good evening.	2.0427881914941532
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	8.720207982934454
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	4.483782246637396
Cause of half the trouble.	1.1598024893558696
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	1.3355090678867074
Fifteen she told me.	14.99296661746489
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	4.496909533261226
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	2.3945425986895614
Neat way she carries parcels too.	14.439845448672779
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	2.840015415155232
Keeps them out of harm ’ s way.	12.133208339425606
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	5.262355307128997
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	8.975191093179566
Big he and little she.	8.037876748421407

For instance if you go into a cellar where it ’ s dark.	3.186189126023332
Vamp of her stockings.	1.1598024893558696
Wonder where it is really.	29.725083635491956
Animals go by that.	1.1598024893558696
Ask yourself who is he now.	2.4734963543465494

No. Wait.	71.5955851705552
All quiet on Howth now.	6.407131833993935
O wait.	21.6960119901062
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	9.438719894257128
Bat probably.	179.77986639549076
Their frugal meal.	16.52828197463027

Say you never see them with three colours.	4.486470053330599
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	3.2948394491905346
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	4.167689697910505

Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	2.137254252081106
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	8.29629166010112
Hopeless.	965.7396422239158
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	10.911288628891329
Might be money.	24.678104473135956
Must come back.	100.86964464403076
What?	2342.5114089148965
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	3.2056477824543794
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	5.985937781022928
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	1.7287529625382807
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	1.5664871694503333
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	2.957474603752468
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	1.747501221601272
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	1.3643374710961138
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	1.48635387718389

Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	1.8913896019688798
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	4.092354908519631
