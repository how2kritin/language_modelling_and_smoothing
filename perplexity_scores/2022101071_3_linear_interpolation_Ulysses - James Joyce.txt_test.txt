955.6763941959977
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	576.786182451787
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	61.674905974230555
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	151.06522918376558
You saved men from drowning.	54.382642859184436
The scrotumtightening sea.	346.7625269421362
There is something sinister in you....	88.80973696827468
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	648.8376570966312
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	1461.7727543084889
Buck Mulligan answered.	13.532223776110527
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	402.18898871539494
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	428.86234238417074
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	463.42160498316446
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	235.9127442065174
A servant too.	166.838300417868
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	137.23863384780157
he said.	10.465399985534118
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	245.20455794286565
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	289.3502520928048
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	79.70180985155336
What did you say that for?	37.95088421507652
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	610.1175491962497
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	47.77714893625083
Brief exposure.	2266.909279254998
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	945.2842949378746
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	129.78729482544503
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	123.66188219802122
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	22.983012289388622
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	114.8905603232773
— Go on then, Talbot.	47.16168002039423
My father gave me seeds to sow.	401.00706639206476
Ask me, sir.	20.22271169365068
— Again, sir.	57.82476805088239
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	72.20024692824285
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	690.7059949721871
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	765.2552855336712
Mr Deasy is calling you.	158.63091907730768
— What is it now?	18.392373066838726
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	336.0749761920599
Money is power.	301.64534167910597
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	149.57300574030276
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	175.4258834403697
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	646.6867466104927
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	238.0613103674571
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	1008.2366672719718
Serum and virus.	1657.6946809922158
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	69.3217700287171
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	1083.2021910075562
I am, a stride at a time.	58.03338008782982
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	336.9254983164979
Yes, I must.	23.760048242407773
Lump of love.	281.7385962152471
It lowers.	351.04580262308696
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	441.4145930448118
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	259.4480477934457
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	3987.1689024178195
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	117.82271483846542
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	2593.3393591197496
_Fermé_.	465.8134931681199
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	233.43963480294144
She serves me at his beck.	263.2494137567518
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	954.638958226736
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	2206.791615169254
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	183.50728830465184
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	211.18428596134757
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	169.06831835491502
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	312.30568833503804
Open hallway.	324.32899429338846
In. Come.	65.996631154537
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	1423.4707437064521
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	182.67416653041272
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	170.45858308185302
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	240.79491353580536
Welcome as the flowers in May.	575.1617414633987
My ashplant will float away.	952.6204525761143
I shall wait.	92.5019436602226
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	316.5655184230596
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	682.3010090105092
The coals were reddening.	996.2238156663071
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	51.2560970167751
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	274.14605400511806
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	1554.6452254486485
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	341.6478676440117
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	400.48762895300246
Not there.	37.570544781495485
Makes you feel young.	131.90833488727904
Getting on to sundown.	263.9554120047835
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	292.554399642528
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	332.5860416595627
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	2795.206540981016
For you, please?	116.3936676682021
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	338.7487103728561
Still an idea behind it.	54.67021091006574
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	34.409081088463076
Yes, yes.	13.779149436236358
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	1404.9819832430107
Here.	19.800593100854
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	1449.1428188874381
Only five she was then.	169.2431463534596
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	74.68264037120498
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	159.64432578677813
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	347.2708093500341
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	602.7936759039293
C.	14.373100099742409
— Here, she said.	17.74020154785749
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	37.085556138813864
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	437.90088052057905
Illustration.	465.8134931681199
An example?	86.12759982419539
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	91.01049458252145
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	131.27823054646737
Byby.	145.83624315865197
Of course it might.	41.46530947969653
Vain: very.	266.4971563997777
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	403.6166530592333
Useless: can ’ t move.	153.7224261609044
Virginia creepers.	2508.747512952396
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	707.7074397875241
Nobody.	34.89043401838291
Invent a story for some proverb.	1235.2713710874666
<URL>.	24.997210943187593
Her head dancing.	174.8343461621833
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	187.8991532320679
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	262.19139548487004
Singing with his eyes shut.	70.2223240772261
In the dark.	20.9264535196432
No - one.	13.350669055543468
Eyes front.	229.49451005483544
Hair?	197.24247939069053
no trouble I hope?	380.20449053588334
I see you ’ re...	19.40713809802588
Having a wet.	171.35233362078384
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	342.62028688275876
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	40.117319556556744
Like to see her again in that.	52.60468371204068
Rachel, is it?	119.24535777558056
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	310.1871246399723
Ruins and tenements.	1578.8790724547096
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	841.8654129144535
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	11.868284106951284

Perfectly right that is.	202.0583633274919
Palestrina for example too.	400.4926038163806
Eunuch.	340.8860847059128

Aq. Dist.	1304.896984849775
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	2497.2357225079495
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	13.286878358652435
How much are they?	53.92028431822585
To look younger.	334.07482773289985
Regular hotbed of it lately.	895.8772141285469
College sports today I see.	517.3739674284623
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	453.3870985584273
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	974.5799750237856
He was alone.	51.35971917028529
Great card he was.	175.15786409982329
His name stinks all over Dublin.	230.35271138080336
Mr Power asked.	15.20384830605139
Gasworks.	465.8134931681199
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	1750.3094978707427
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	229.6691013635744
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	66.26869613878017
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	160.79364903878943
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	18.955481236100262
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	24.220198485302337
What causes that?	243.65687662331237
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	1871.4811635101998
And _Madame_.	58.43662648480814
Or the Moira, was it?	64.69256836046557
— About the boatman?	159.54306173238948
Mr Power asked.	15.20384830605139
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	8.254277600571053
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	22.09771961658226
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	107.85648050058616
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	120.2083815445014
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	80.73856070748867
Very encouraging.	496.14907997191716
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	144.58855553045652
— What ’ s wrong now?	35.84159351370662
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	113.96652001045598
— Why?	18.250995805704118
Terrible! — First round Dunphy ’ s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	57.07913154621257
Elixir of life.	218.10142398079032

Ned Lambert says he ’ ll try to get one of the girls into Todd ’ s.	107.01773062212558
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	201.3547801961115
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	563.0609104033817
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	103.54635755648502
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	1212.57200036566
Eh?	23.62115905831347
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	105.04640383567519
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	15.265144983516914
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	1353.511683320622
All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells.	1084.7066524508232

— L, Mr Bloom said.	31.54805370457442
And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	39.667977898218886
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	90.17433413113064
We have time.	46.06129530035655
More interesting if they told you what they were.	65.76286695538272
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.	1094.7253346961104

Jolly Mat.	674.2262154103609
Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	474.16370523628353
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	1457.9748446939504
Way out.	123.17960159002256

Hynes asked.	134.5422124865665
This ad, you see.	85.46204561293486
Then here the name.	56.05867648566001
You know the usual.	55.82538649517283
Highclass licensed premises.	336.8760883978429
NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	2364.4318593089624
a voice asked from the castingbox.	120.34559355909481
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	349.0718174900933
How quickly he does that job.	139.70415602972616
Pop in a minute to phone.	282.83180230576824
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	546.3308717262711
Bladderbags.	465.8134931681199

_ — That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... _ — O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	502.044888003128
No, twenty...	47.30847431788274
J.	9.525932994442917
It was at the royal university dinner.	76.25090330806653

The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen ’ s and Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s loose ties.	120.66515644725503
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	171.71805931698964

In Mooney ’ s _en ville_ and in Mooney ’ s _sur <URL> He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.	534.1248570550393
He looked towards the saloon door.	138.2082806154456
And blind too, poor fellow.	106.28172837112042

O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	1162.4443650278345
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	966.8917744054941
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	89.9970860722276
Clock whirred.	422.84419892509356
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	633.4633796104689
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	754.4734198668232
I was only vamping, man.	137.70603262291186
His gouty paws plumped chords.	1318.5224153802474
What?	14.617951109062046
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: — _When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	1292.0615896464642

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	428.38106146291045
Look at this, says he.	23.918567360386024
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	148.40986071435776
And he started laughing.	176.12805054593633
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	52.2758487269291
says I.	15.317749111486599
The tear is bloody near your eye.	407.3939442947675
— _...	10.298354536063062
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	36.512378606049
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	137.0947817533012
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	322.44396108381295
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	279.0306530754139
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	2894.2395710650967
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	2122.868360712871
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	1559.992747328957
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	1048.4177370244697
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	590.7271986059922
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	737.8228533357154
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	39.981273234997516
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	423.38504819782645

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	65.18472786298176

— Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	137.41140704076707
It was a knockout clean and clever.	301.11099759831467
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	101.8167742908935
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	280.93253267931243
J.	9.525932994442917
Look at his head.	23.787104284481714
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	21.92809446004171
What?	14.617951109062046
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	381.3648888502149
And J.	35.11781236265097
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	1649.29088711066
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	910.855485478858
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	512.1738167213645

And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	4012.8429545133044

There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	504.1732267603631
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	753.0656612213575
— That covers my case, says Joe.	103.87847486483565
I was born here.	43.65111460020386
— And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	160.4193947299844

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	82.35112116112474
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	607.5979621033987

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	1432.671485921225
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	160.27284425590386

Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	138.82611974876608
— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	124.36046154474512
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	91.18387430519265
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	673.4113433600936
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	2086.8577562518853
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	949.9026643776987
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	659.14334446104
The colours were done something lovely.	733.7991977238177
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	422.20203540074993
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	494.6419682843778
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	574.9717519286783
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	3135.1167388864465
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	319.9317025003954
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	190.74809487770162
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	452.7399130978648
Sister?	34.712158999972864
Cheap too.	130.8939926889698
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	114.91045533976293
And I ’ ll write to you.	23.875461923875402
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	469.1862810047796
All are.	32.65057687839058
Took off her hat to show her hair.	128.80090716858152
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she ’ s on for it: good evening.	151.82459564823975
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	654.0536755733701
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	190.2713180529387
Cause of half the trouble.	410.77946160391474
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	224.99211441619622
Fifteen she told me.	65.31782206324993
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	127.70324523750496
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	342.2929353774289
Neat way she carries parcels too.	845.0679972498124
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	6978.686302676678
Keeps them out of harm ’ s way.	42.99561120665301
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	856.1638936497661
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	507.6955399681041
Big he and little she.	177.6574978272129
Tip.	35.61852722871305
For instance if you go into a cellar where it ’ s dark.	134.16937604247727
Vamp of her stockings.	422.8363127398215
Wonder where it is really.	66.57401204165858
Animals go by that.	414.9842065835012
Ask yourself who is he now.	154.8641254938128
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	150.51513727109605
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	823.5890547656695
Old Betty ’ s joints are on the rack.	408.7380379160648
And distant hills seem coming nigh.	239.8660977470346
Bailey light.	540.6652537951527
No. Wait.	44.72031083710352
All quiet on Howth now.	289.34141944238144
O wait.	39.34978710055151
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	268.7262261895103
Bat probably.	304.69540684754395
Their frugal meal.	1126.5755557541775
Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.	821.9069117871195
Say you never see them with three colours.	264.4509623126622
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	581.4408556520798
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	184.88814429052817
And says she and says he.	45.22073871282438
Calomel purge I got her for that.	586.0674928775381

Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	85.22131882971435
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	265.8876284610752
Hopeless.	149.85427334658803
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	318.04922829739644
Might be money.	59.4182370707539
Must come back.	29.372452681794194
What?	14.617951109062046
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	260.624750322632
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	59.005752860808094
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	474.68290585449586
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	1849.550908524702
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	340.0692395800426
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	484.25270969315994
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	1871.676298529952
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	672.0801105515068

Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	380.6794902051097
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	4873.313856053392
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.	882.350928452166
