11536.787832697575
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	16842.048511082874
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	12535.466719037599
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	9807.079025263814
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	16388.763520869
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	10946.110769709168
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	13859.516346886056
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	14728.408115197417
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	11456.530922255595
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	8482.313328560254
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	13471.951186495611
Slow music, please.	17932.61452774436
Shut your eyes, gents.	12428.805889688656
One moment.	5294.525690911976
Silence, all.	16807.8688531982
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	13808.528524884525
Chrysostomos.	19456.598729469286
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	12833.647665740731
That will do nicely.	7447.814857738817
Switch off the current, will you?	14175.167266912102
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	13128.227796854404
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	12686.770656745939
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	9265.333309951531
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	5889.430127808212
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	14792.780158304544
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	14806.233356736797
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	7381.495194681043
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	9488.837126078968
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	9323.191878197706
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	17451.623842446083
We must go to Athens.	9158.64903397373
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	13469.60374584965
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	11525.96167792297
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	11115.20354139353
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	7380.936255506707
— Yes, my love?	2524.724303034102
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	10139.07889180083
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	7221.703311369717
he said frankly.	6453.918362257952
A ponderous Saxon.	6108.478345590255
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	7456.619430859077
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	12053.14950770609
Because he comes from Oxford.	9355.326537575653
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	10074.50612588965
He can ’ t make you out.	8549.770433995098
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	10515.532422264869
He shaved warily over his chin.	8282.810077087443
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	7013.896394374425
Where is his guncase?	6930.413852502493
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	6145.813426792094
Were you in a funk?	11361.723980330748
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	6619.3957378449295
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	13901.463949074858
I ’ m not a hero, however.	3679.235720634861
If he stays on here I am off.	10149.464244210882
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	9347.539627129705
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	10843.891838651462
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	7552.619014829941
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	13440.448966388627
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	13988.413015181024
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	7548.770012547072
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	13450.276427412773
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	9000.746145152621
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	12703.352840358732
— God! he said quietly.	5305.302701734842
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	12854.191385769594
The snotgreen sea.	5442.1386306936365
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	18227.54902377354
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	11238.621786238617
You must read them in the original.	8603.274101955962
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	17162.064257603583
Come and look.	8904.123792673425
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	10259.040927469407
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	16937.447176526683
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	5661.849883884199
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	9687.775534472014
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	5362.987609985831
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	7384.552477022065
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	8241.793916730117
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	9176.795926399644
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	4736.116142795594
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	13577.532951801017
And you refused.	5078.320022890936
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	9515.57602504523
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	8872.392851107246
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	8093.906596644416
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	16076.654124447987
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	13851.67426982879
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	16318.916210301157
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	14387.070875951682
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	15707.7299355458
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	11413.09423104223
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	14147.360456619457
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	7548.770012547072
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	7767.223548032315
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	9150.68522571088
How are the secondhand breeks?	7604.399767126544
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	6507.435520033671
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	9195.023174200873
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	6110.6014470032715
Secondleg they should be.	17932.61452774436
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	8065.1405369055965
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	6693.294360540544
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	3447.2512344559577
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	10490.209305789856
— Thanks, Stephen said.	3468.2016924526242
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	7497.141726967993
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	9052.665040099013
Etiquette is etiquette.	18227.54902377354
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	11137.074965400006
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	13087.207948855481
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	10712.167349206775
p.	8886.43178553976
i.	19456.598729469286
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	5368.406020254533
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	15744.850257804519
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	12645.73563121988
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	16158.125825015217
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	12760.550021303587
Hair on end.	15175.67984183378
As he and others see me.	9519.249888872704
Who chose this face for me?	11191.303795472364
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	12010.913107149021
It asks me too.	8201.386601223077
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	7058.198260108738
It does her all right.	8554.791175250653
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	9107.247522908538
Lead him not into temptation.	17724.87334026543
And her name is Ursula.	7302.279217258361
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	16093.056726455048
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	7843.947492816862
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	14407.127503648657
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	7458.858504517287
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	13668.316595675327
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	7423.997095496111
he said kindly.	5951.245188291493
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	13630.408998720903
Parried again.	18679.07077551165
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	11433.984092194223
The cold steel pen.	5621.617405779097
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	12431.985847308917
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	6721.077986209454
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	13378.989088737637
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	13593.66749868436
Hellenise it.	18679.07077551165
Cranly ’ s arm.	11621.708529832362
His arm.	5472.23830674402
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	8372.261034136083
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	5562.802178102684
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	9792.7985773155
What have you up your nose against me?	8934.957459954048
Is it Haines?	7208.98522198738
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	13886.329674639359
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	14861.027645517965
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	16627.414130203724
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	14196.646450609049
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	10512.986157440577
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	10322.927402682271
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	13445.172116755473
To ourselves...	9530.31373028954
new paganism...	17932.61452774436
omphalos.	19456.598729469286
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	4657.175681407401
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	7361.957358106096
— Then what is it?	4953.943530171774
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	5541.243362143623
Cough it up.	18227.54902377354
I ’ m quite frank with you.	4122.03295422184
What have you against me now?	7661.442303745223
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	13515.248136156812
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	10261.597993460822
— Do you wish me to tell you?	5567.010311555644
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
— Yes, what is it?	2706.870093672855
I don ’ t remember anything.	3146.083355782009
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	8644.548240506956
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	12749.515822449992
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	13770.420178288752
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	9347.693861334665
Where?	1683.5310292764207
I can ’ t remember anything.	4799.769477584299
I remember only ideas and sensations.	7162.6727967212
Why?	1363.914055113649
What happened in the name of God?	8717.187925440901
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	9941.257020259025
She asked you who was in your room.	10024.315325540312
— Yes?	1163.3156576058952
Buck Mulligan said.	2617.9798127526824
What did I say?	5073.114470528815
I forget.	4389.602684722832
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	12921.465167152832
— Did I say that?	4878.033315804712
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
Well?	3501.394758727052
What harm is that?	6907.55012553418
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	8943.670073404995
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	9917.582859291102
You saw only your mother die.	9919.236497526586
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	11710.727943290223
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	5134.424500805598
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	9771.709316273324
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	12144.330545093639
Why?	1363.914055113649
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	11452.79032545139
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	11172.584058815377
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	12071.788583784179
Humour her till it ’ s over.	15446.381252378562
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	14357.16342986708
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	16194.737672074629
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	8408.526554532684
He had spoken himself into boldness.	6438.969835456681
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	13928.36436690612
— Of what then?	4617.353665426892
Buck Mulligan asked.	3786.611347342713
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	7121.921766904303
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	8615.023012974736
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	5387.215899470124
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	7264.539988665144
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	12848.237939625906
Sea and headland now grew dim.	15669.322221546165
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	16917.721652030206
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	12333.256494461657
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	3593.9319047139365
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	8284.718882863286
What does it care about offences?	8166.575598952294
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	8254.458994756533
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	12200.911469185517
I ’ m inconsequent.	2058.5292253760767
Give up the moody brooding.	12039.893179193552
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	13459.348645375658
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	17010.718138155575
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	17010.718138155575
White breast of the dim sea.	14775.430373562524
The twining stresses, two by two.	8148.237220483912
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	10554.251367988209
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	17356.98505688499
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	10496.77197846591
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	11255.910145358337
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	16597.602580130613
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	12988.64627991084
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	16644.041190546446
She was crying in her wretched bed.	8023.548337218709
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	12527.67349959519
Where now?	7299.005733981272
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	14505.456902881266
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	14317.449870114664
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	17451.623842446083
And no more turn aside and brood.	6142.565999077392
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	17215.988293285944
Memories beset his brooding brain.	17724.87334026543
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	13589.00907356242
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	13181.753874586488
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	13887.853162508332
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	12472.816055905641
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	13746.422923152692
On me alone.	8981.323278585294
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	8254.458994756533
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	17570.648302713715
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	13588.983380816233
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	11024.957040830941
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	16572.82288731537
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	11172.889643545119
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	11277.729392760513
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	13276.693889649392
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	9479.812288846291
Breakfast is ready.	18227.54902377354
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	13538.952334804333
It ’ s all right.	1574.9612511732003
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	4081.586586283136
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	6028.96277444769
For my sake and for all our sakes.	11201.347619779584
His head disappeared and reappeared.	7959.83991932457
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	5905.730262390599
He says it ’ s very clever.	8549.71295838215
Touch him for a quid, will you?	12254.932182888257
A guinea, I mean.	7121.979900031425
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	4914.3605921879
— The school kip?	3265.8831301103055
Buck Mulligan said.	2617.9798127526824
How much?	4058.7895865401047
Four quid?	12825.524320071201
Lend us one.	16807.8688531982
— If you want it, Stephen said.	4596.156093845201
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	9479.788390872767
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	10654.491918750868
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	13492.86464334258
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	12633.448215021612
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	10403.972071259352
Why should I bring it down?	10906.422729012029
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	12648.393575507103
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	13085.950286797553
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	11629.780002166122
I am another now and yet the same.	7156.690807067849
A server of a servant.	7229.955951129247
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	13257.631792425203
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	15406.387122510174
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	4858.77009789839
Haines, open that door, will you?	10476.29697800692
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	10425.279444829474
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	12962.241332511765
— Have you the key?	4735.4214232267095
a voice asked.	15868.195079096857
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	5711.433002416887
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	13235.189487826196
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	13001.014634647898
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	13231.766472303092
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	10527.42717182298
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	12859.04128841832
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	6960.724413740819
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	12760.673986226579
Haines, come in.	10559.927648480649
The grub is ready.	6549.046155587141
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	17216.031693751804
Where ’ s the sugar?	5079.59834737807
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	8399.138253330902
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	13262.496678269537
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	8478.854914202364
— What sort of a kip is this?	6237.585022352114
I told her to come after eight.	7329.807407453443
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	7498.938732161919
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	5611.196431797724
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	5810.605074727199
I want Sandycove milk.	4937.800145163974
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	15030.244702949338
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	9904.574849996758
Sit down.	12340.567951090532
Pour out the tea there.	17724.87334026543
The sugar is in the bag.	8254.458994756533
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	12125.572476455034
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	14234.736215201685
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	4300.438929039186
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	9623.9425030584
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	13621.578269128733
And when I makes water I makes water.	8280.275695393942
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	7893.8195087146105
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	12262.115570890277
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	16361.10315720104
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	7419.647603863781
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	15308.62075697991
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	16627.485986391777
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	12927.833205398214
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	5778.209020589017
— Do you now?	2883.386496890917
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	7976.512385390739
Your reasons, pray?	11485.27443672835
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	9832.611075629204
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	15824.332008050467
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	7381.495194681043
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	12204.976740233134
Do you think she was?	6508.622146006113
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	15992.98206250187
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	12464.321332118867
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	9484.074403340821
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	8945.344868387368
Kinch, get the jug.	15150.556721689854
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	12557.555849542963
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	4050.100847631534
Glory be to God.	11955.37773549704
— To whom?	3674.713374409653
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	15024.123100403687
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	12231.047388570361
— How much, sir?	4315.381786694455
asked the old woman.	14553.805056755707
— A quart, Stephen said.	3811.7171604488326
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	11735.573774305829
Old shrunken paps.	10227.348794111555
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	10024.315325540312
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	14225.823552009391
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	11866.536698374883
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	16819.419911419274
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	11730.107923515714
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	17010.748408491785
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	13921.563639447637
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	14011.556170635007
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	8613.676612893774
— Taste it, sir, she said.	5819.292538481236
He drank at her bidding.	6156.262994553694
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	12841.860273751634
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	16210.440479048213
— Are you a medical student, sir?	5725.1930069467935
the old woman asked.	10587.520927784351
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	5445.487513530405
— Look at that now, she said.	5588.076947492732
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	10261.597993460822
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	13912.148959320768
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	11681.111439070157
— Do you understand what he says?	4777.827697808961
Stephen asked her.	6146.669914610261
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	6805.190028459582
the old woman said to Haines.	11249.74464150328
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	13996.655284628438
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	4606.658808287841
Is there Gaelic on you?	10690.034402560348
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	8551.349451667356
Are you from the west, sir?	10412.22600377929
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	5030.314413922324
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	8454.900013034363
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	7378.602012420591
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	10207.397358837745
Wonderful entirely.	13208.696921829242
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	16194.737672074629
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	10227.388820674709
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	11021.847022505577
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	12967.787456076361
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	11611.084388702524
Stephen filled again the three cups.	10353.349983241147
— Bill, sir?	5817.3251072490575
she said, halting.	14932.412306617918
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	13226.609294691845
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	8231.406887171086
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	12982.268754276836
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	10884.848596146352
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	13425.674768214745
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	14421.119506312498
All I can give you I give.	10452.3108138868
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	10916.941040347487
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	4454.477860868351
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	9895.854733602524
Time enough.	6518.005128700658
Good morning, sir.	7953.221698097532
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	14475.853878419073
I ’ m stony.	2058.5292253760767
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	16031.724873860056
Today the bards must drink and junket.	15762.537251106416
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	15287.25397875327
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	9902.80831362752
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	5329.003779747927
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	9763.130528775488
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	12229.430917028176
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	11630.590038698312
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	15682.738511776339
Speaking to me.	15868.195079096857
They wash and tub and scrub.	9881.954723581033
Agenbite of inwit.	8902.13241632879
Conscience.	19456.598729469286
Yet here ’ s a spot.	13549.590395388454
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	10292.617675132586
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	13314.75500884153
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	8193.931022310351
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	9371.278056705896
— Would I make any money by it?	7914.326062859932
Stephen asked.	2565.8259170644847
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	13824.586209314493
He strolled out to the doorway.	6438.799453753109
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	12202.714569968382
— Well?	1817.8908901629998
Stephen said.	4036.2442405669176
The problem is to get money.	8254.458994756533
From whom?	8275.153022040167
From the milkwoman or from him.	8447.619808763702
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	4397.408596045077
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	10676.513778577779
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	7606.001023952793
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	10113.479927093978
— From me, Kinch, he said.	5866.926784305322
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	12826.64494718359
Damn all else they are good for.	14301.750232150835
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	10685.466745011845
To hell with them all.	7981.989139418386
Let us get out of the kip.	10379.950520613414
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	11661.026135802687
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	8096.544975491838
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	3740.513585768177
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	13530.91867629948
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	11324.358852726737
I want puce gloves and green boots.	6749.951237478978
Contradiction.	19456.598729469286
Do I contradict myself?	10356.112515699075
Very well then, I contradict myself.	13951.656909662132
Mercurial Malachi.	18679.07077551165
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	10916.932126969617
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	5898.641337353672
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	11839.114385003084
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	14698.057466284985
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	6135.581535692738
Come out, Kinch.	9065.511140936185
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	7140.434923770243
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	16854.733822291528
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	13928.377533709177
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	8497.180439177158
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	12720.973299719188
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	5996.52018457794
He walked on.	2664.3076707937253
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	15710.498137002467
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	12160.984831484946
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	5309.263722486346
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	9404.548229085334
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	13280.803379152336
Martello you call it?	16760.897092969924
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	11148.96458388654
But ours is the _omphalos_.	9162.5895952032
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	4427.720627259044
Haines asked Stephen.	9654.928686367944
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	6421.3210946374
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	8704.277823038585
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	10518.80465568845
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	12534.423745583737
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	9731.178549827418
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	7061.062046228422
Is it some paradox?	8278.122142547034
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	4969.085279793365
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	9976.126876811144
It ’ s quite simple.	3400.174861374015
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	11943.93682555884
— What?	681.7536505896779
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	12353.641659605568
He himself?	3750.728011825402
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	14639.20963778798
And it is rather long to tell.	8434.529796513461
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	9570.040244926346
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	6843.218719615459
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	10915.042899666394
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	13325.842845284233
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	11180.004717632513
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	11507.7892377422
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	7959.244073420167
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	15374.555114893907
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	13543.638911954096
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	8202.299063345652
The Father and the Son idea.	8254.458994756533
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	9975.267020722324
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	10527.42717182298
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	12203.753142022158
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	14010.76371622515
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	12071.04753998526
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	11586.250331273503
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	13757.232331207952
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	15409.264070652345
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	9986.378053622737
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	15870.986701982998
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	13853.002898472774
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	2823.397840340344
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	4995.785575916884
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	12408.507431404223
What did he call it?	5439.437060557337
Joseph the Joiner?	15868.195079096857
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	6279.538183694888
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	6401.361679767445
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	9895.640918314408
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	5383.248709926159
Haines asked.	8440.75436192588
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	8417.917727146936
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	14911.237976450355
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	7509.644256392217
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	14698.005156447156
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	6681.417804249034
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	13538.952334804333
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	13751.573700737668
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	6733.788944804774
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	12634.064301881066
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	16153.144866552393
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	8434.216192785223
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	10353.319652186658
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	10413.78537591854
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	16289.263798257522
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	13919.314978819384
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	11064.292384286857
He wants that key.	5478.37872355234
It is mine.	4121.264694190491
I paid the rent.	5861.92346583866
Now I eat his salt bread.	10154.15347659535
Give him the key too.	10562.815437289391
All.	3651.6613392020126
He will ask for it.	7082.073948416487
That was in his eyes.	5403.1261177754595
— After all, Haines began...	6428.585876945875
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	12918.569418043004
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	9048.062865073794
You are your own master, it seems to me.	8876.313329436922
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	8837.658139415053
— Italian?	2546.31996829899
Haines said.	7982.832980209769
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	9507.376927886024
Kneel down before me.	17932.61452774436
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	9309.8677363656
— Italian?	2546.31996829899
Haines said again.	9233.571046342086
What do you mean?	3842.8492352367534
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	10827.152492199939
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	14333.029224561435
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	6498.081585411033
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	12408.697549172808
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	11552.752496674902
It seems history is to blame.	8393.495967268345
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	14685.746955517046
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	16736.708185792166
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	14955.476878833608
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	16627.414130203724
Idle mockery.	18679.07077551165
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	14635.16009678127
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	15669.322221546165
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	16809.478789587127
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	7641.81634624413
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	8345.059295527391
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	14242.674601676092
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	6546.887643916838
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	11115.179523658668
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	4850.10285304294
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	10537.06925602341
It ’ s nine days today.	4143.2499487344785
The man that was drowned.	4339.797540263515
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	13836.496883914851
Here I am.	9379.295600321297
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	10675.789608026378
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	11215.27752149525
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	13397.36247018305
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	6674.232180910347
— Down in Westmeath.	5182.699741025079
With the Bannons.	8040.9130531175915
— Still there?	3930.4639972732775
I got a card from Bannon.	7596.0039864657265
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	15637.633581627138
Photo girl he calls her.	15786.109314441857
— Snapshot, eh?	5817.3251072490575
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	8478.854914202364
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	13919.879942387639
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	13679.477374618084
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	17356.98505688499
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	5542.882924243626
— Going over next week to stew.	8239.274872544624
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	8684.099755415342
— Yes.	607.5585411172303
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	9351.00568971699
The father is rotto with money.	8254.458994756533
— Is she up the pole?	5597.013152106249
— Better ask Seymour that.	5772.368764483471
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	6896.437012653497
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	13249.71912232043
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	10626.54602553069
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	8156.144652480039
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	6189.449741835938
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	12158.185548720507
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	5440.112547170879
— Yes.	607.5585411172303
Make room in the bed.	12287.761454525322
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	11696.872875965397
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	13538.993291871215
— Are you not coming in?	4620.535956933168
Buck Mulligan asked.	3786.611347342713
— Later on, Haines said.	7179.394409205831
Not on my breakfast.	8405.98653540238
Stephen turned away.	6807.6799933032
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	3243.2637413827447
Stephen handed him the key.	9684.138221896656
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	9195.023174200873
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	6987.5830524919675
Throw it there.	15868.195079096857
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	11839.042756733283
Dressing, undressing.	16807.8688531982
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	12201.426358756284
Thus spake Zarathustra.	15175.67984183378
His plump body plunged.	8463.106177213733
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	10757.704860673231
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	15910.65548740836
Half twelve.	12198.155126919923
— Good, Stephen said.	3107.033081894061
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	5923.277307406639
Liliata rutilantium.	18679.07077551165
Turma circumdet.	12452.996386040257
Iubilantium te virginum.	9653.994498991498
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	9595.29491732911
I will not sleep here tonight.	6219.7463000801245
Home also I cannot go.	16727.42622563514
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	15446.433163739166
It called again.	7128.86975871534
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	12719.220533858102
Usurper.	19456.598729469286
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	7154.274081958012
— Tarentum, sir.	5817.3251072490575
— Very good.	2805.2928677441555
Well?	3501.394758727052
— There was a battle, sir.	4810.9585712608805
— Very good.	2805.2928677441555
Where?	1683.5310292764207
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	9639.195634632428
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	15876.99308527025
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	11680.271297480844
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	12535.466719037599
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	10859.826280951958
What ’ s left us then?	5237.037207317952
— I forget the place, sir.	5141.373213788039
<NUM> B.	10258.237914252943
C.	1161.2080535937555
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	11670.309389536407
— Yes, sir.	685.2426457191965
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	11356.476203516195
A dull ease of the mind.	8433.94953544488
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	13902.127397257043
Any general to any officers.	14084.625240398014
They lend ear.	7257.990460918538
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	3950.731132021024
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	6923.130166013323
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	7179.394409205831
— I know, sir.	2273.886998326886
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	15446.485083126767
— Wait.	2744.7304608609625
You, Armstrong.	6733.135977078874
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	6429.844770411516
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	11270.831868365593
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	11136.978707189392
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	16667.347011617076
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	8872.392851107246
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	16627.414130203724
Vico Road, Dalkey.	17932.61452774436
— Pyrrhus, sir?	5437.220954484873
Pyrrhus, a pier.	15665.739701619705
All laughed.	6523.269050754646
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	17932.61452774436
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	17162.064257603583
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	12691.779985819529
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	11815.395503658503
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	6784.900218539206
A thing out in the water.	8433.94953544488
A kind of a bridge.	8117.899790053171
Kingstown pier, sir.	17932.61452774436
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	13858.756305820938
Two in the back bench whispered.	12047.101349680637
Yes.	992.2748593504894
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	11730.107923515714
All.	3651.6613392020126
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	13534.408133126124
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	15014.722949273642
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	5300.831381694208
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	5886.372783528673
The words troubled their gaze.	7054.376609466871
— How, sir?	3872.4545653934074
Comyn asked.	18679.07077551165
A bridge is across a river.	8872.392851107246
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	10467.998492262444
No - one here to hear.	6263.466252251591
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	16605.27055147329
What then?	5310.3952380902765
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	13181.753874586488
Why had they chosen all that part?	11421.998585383766
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	11015.802066113903
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	13803.574694104553
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	15124.471413837304
They are not to be thought away.	7613.258750677542
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	15030.223051370289
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	12029.992137806486
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	11446.278128289474
Weave, weaver of the wind.	17570.648302713715
— Tell us a story, sir.	6752.085910262084
— O, do, sir.	3538.303253467797
A ghoststory.	4762.787687825449
— Where do you begin in this?	6230.331222817247
Stephen asked, opening another book.	8466.86784419698
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	8833.282560747075
— And the story, sir?	4382.020171050803
— After, Stephen said.	3696.518809902071
Go on, Talbot.	11733.482860179582
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	12535.466719037599
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	14536.79618964588
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	15790.682283760274
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	12684.85821207653
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	16717.18280161994
Thought is the thought of thought.	15024.066288223417
Tranquil brightness.	18679.07077551165
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	11896.447480558876
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	16249.81104549519
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	15430.85629102106
I don ’ t see anything.	3358.73467326404
— What, sir?	2485.953442405966
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	16112.477388603033
His hand turned the page over.	8413.075221736126
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	10472.110899071193
Of him that walked the waves.	12047.146904730813
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	14872.594142733444
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	12708.5330223187
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	13609.038509329552
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	13079.442747974748
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	13563.190910273475
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	16194.737672074629
— Have I heard all?	5540.019670836503
Stephen asked.	2565.8259170644847
— Yes, sir.	685.2426457191965
Hockey at ten, sir.	16727.42622563514
— Half day, sir.	5447.558807327802
Thursday.	11785.351918411056
— Who can answer a riddle?	5362.332261270601
Stephen asked.	2565.8259170644847
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	12043.626024309768
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	16937.421557610043
— O, ask me, sir.	3792.826688455648
— A hard one, sir.	5430.9306280854225
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	11576.510487586469
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	12627.769747025237
What is that?	3073.0214286069486
— What, sir?	2485.953442405966
We didn ’ t hear.	8871.373882008542
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	12807.087223727889
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	12621.35290869292
We give it up.	9316.809644546893
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	12127.804769518647
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	10413.802877593496
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	14001.431067005833
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	16375.675333192034
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	16620.767957823315
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	13770.226153886728
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	13646.353825489965
He held out his copybook.	5963.16230260012
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	9107.247522908538
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	16351.752733035777
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	17451.623842446083
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	10835.120172523259
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	11408.175043110501
Futility.	19456.598729469286
— Do you understand how to do them now?	5987.267098824611
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	8482.313328560254
— Can you do them yourself?	6583.583490446724
Stephen asked.	2565.8259170644847
— No, sir.	2141.436176963935
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	15990.813337799382
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	15052.565492745178
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	9756.654098098881
Was that then real?	10105.524446714033
The only true thing in life?	7458.830300462216
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	12645.73563121988
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	12741.862818598198
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	11311.542512427488
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	14283.99636022592
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	15071.800082522368
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	10572.543322617961
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	16682.90235283324
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	16959.24882930963
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	15831.205220320084
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	14707.07901151939
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	16056.743609984127
— Do you understand now?	3351.4549981156974
Can you work the second for yourself?	11014.309425668926
— Yes, sir.	685.2426457191965
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	10725.923819647183
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	16579.473645281072
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	16667.397432479003
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	14292.454678990613
My childhood bends beside me.	10626.382741620842
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	14251.37783637833
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	15637.676580432177
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	16575.91859784872
The sum was done.	6549.046155587141
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	7369.7144288758
— Yes, sir.	685.2426457191965
Thanks, Sargent answered.	10402.963909776516
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	12537.278225907834
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	11736.286584849655
— Yes, sir.	685.2426457191965
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	9853.903325847385
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	7228.322651267076
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	11807.823822557086
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	12301.790649066503
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	12953.876733586632
He turned his angry white moustache.	5461.713511099974
he cried continually without listening.	11363.048558628716
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	8739.155321989685
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	10716.533671973537
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	12904.060347451148
What is it now?	4159.191225452003
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	15366.80427877232
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	16601.194688851698
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	12968.864901234525
As it was in the beginning, is now.	12227.082952020804
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	11969.204814285578
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	13379.327857984954
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	11270.831868365593
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	17162.064257603583
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	6972.346167888492
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	11129.074309908361
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	9386.02510970253
And now his strongroom for the gold.	8434.529796513461
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	15072.794716037695
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	12557.528715172839
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	12333.234547642382
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	9520.223147847024
These are handy things to have.	15024.066288223417
See.	3447.41254620683
This is for sovereigns.	7718.5802975529705
This is for shillings.	7718.5802975529705
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	18227.54902377354
And here crowns.	5833.351982221742
See.	3447.41254620683
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	9638.29914779087
— Three twelve, he said.	4248.449401614263
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	7716.636351007035
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	9966.204526010115
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	5013.069639374726
You have earned it.	5857.251993539628
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	12754.051913996354
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	17451.682501789175
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	11583.29174846246
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	6332.19928687801
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	8390.445480955012
You just buy one of these machines.	10035.800416994727
You ’ ll find them very handy.	6693.294360540544
Answer something.	16878.573427268955
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	7228.322651267076
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	11388.05554503291
Three times now.	10914.469829787298
Three nooses round me here.	12288.345246564351
Well?	3501.394758727052
I can break them in this instant if I will.	9033.933849617792
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	10290.069516749156
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	8450.165195874983
When you have lived as long as I have.	11643.915783072693
I know, I know.	5015.860749321103
If youth but knew.	9741.64735404385
But what does Shakespeare say?	8298.845949590817
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	17162.064257603583
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	10304.455646091
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	5716.326271522192
He made money.	4392.769360882124
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	10512.986157440577
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	7847.130086882692
The seas ’ ruler.	5347.354675808615
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	13943.33471465989
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	8750.13206991943
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	7552.619014829941
That ’ s not English.	3139.139393765102
A French Celt said that.	8117.899790053171
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	8173.109145438142
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	8016.274161977292
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	16224.754514648872
_ — I paid my way.	5357.978568591032
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	10087.614997258672
_I owe <URL> Can you?	16053.975985553223
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	15802.380317054405
Curran, ten guineas.	17932.61452774436
McCann, one guinea.	17932.61452774436
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	15786.109314441857
Temple, two lunches.	17932.61452774436
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	16419.753426037176
The lump I have is useless.	8254.458994756533
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	7310.597557423557
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	10699.922035140511
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	7138.141809141562
But one day you must feel it.	9671.796938882095
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	10627.081009545445
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	13600.911945086928
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	9828.930095567577
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	9490.040592900012
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	7513.812308227862
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	12883.755695692464
You fenians forget some things.	9221.483806420649
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	16112.477388603033
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	11413.09423104223
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	16644.041190546446
The black north and true blue bible.	8523.694974858749
Croppies lie down.	18227.54902377354
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	10261.597993460822
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	5592.4722588160885
On the spindle side.	6114.6035203135125
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	11273.74855155835
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	9110.15806576688
— Alas, Stephen said.	4505.990070953832
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	10885.243625955049
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	12997.45227916888
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	13210.650666400139
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	10047.931632725
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	11897.768400589806
Day!...	8493.984503995023
Day!...	8493.984503995023
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	12477.923332665976

Lal the ral the raddy.	11928.367605722959
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	4008.7160256038364
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	11715.536935284143
I have a letter here for the press.	6244.8443457211115
Sit down a moment.	13602.859108471028
I have just to copy the end.	6441.689744525366
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	12540.249003373794
— Sit down.	4014.1416462636403
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	15213.966110586181
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	14350.829224428979
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	11839.042756733283
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	16701.041179084947
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	17279.93518182534
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	9351.00568971699
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	16697.52294580959
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	13786.493789689648
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	16760.742224363035
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	17115.978107251347
Again: a goal.	14932.487582743664
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	10638.986997336706
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	12171.371249971558
Jousts.	16997.075953601572
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	13242.16274270823
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	16577.632543400265
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	7504.66381845076
Stephen stood up.	6807.638811509694
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	6011.436577444536
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	4724.034073503981
Just look through it.	10715.153781622123
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	12058.353585697098
May I trespass on your valuable space.	13671.730684475664

— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	5393.038355054436
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	8165.955405131596

Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	16667.347011617076
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	6239.90788760056
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	11592.17316156279
And it can be cured.	6959.639666047686
It is cured.	4121.264694190491
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	14360.909417004059
They offer to come over here.	9881.954723581033
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	8228.070883167145

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	10424.704525113157
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	6807.21659455094
England is in the hands of the jews.	16667.447851968205
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	12226.842461050413
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	9483.282330991933
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	17115.978107251347
I have seen it coming these years.	6738.512517404243
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	14180.889048653793
Old England is dying.	11079.13719112889
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	11913.634615208242
He faced about and back again.	6211.395722680959
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	10564.900199307682
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	10137.946779884971
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	11639.15025784526
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	11390.042703761632
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	8658.73801979574
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	9316.623565182324
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	10941.05984877658
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	11325.155638216813
Gabble of geese.	18227.54902377354
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	13150.474999875622
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	12876.177724191391
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	15153.463265644446
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	16702.366946211594
Time surely would scatter all.	12429.55752372533
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	11270.831868365593
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	14259.041754066198
— Who has not?	3684.6665544750945
Stephen said.	4036.2442405669176
— What do you mean?	3658.772242228066
Mr Deasy asked.	3950.0490415379622
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	9199.520478138898
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	10004.661937286033
Is this old wisdom?	10636.169657666971
He waits to hear from me.	7595.427771470045
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	10979.361713322585
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	10060.958575484196
A whirring whistle: goal.	8117.899790053171
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	10937.387323645431
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	7271.358881109833
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	12898.888858530507
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	13417.2302109495
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	16194.737672074629
Mr Deasy asked.	3950.0490415379622
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	9129.355602848438
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	12015.659748561737
Looking up again he set them free.	13439.69274033005
— I am happier than you are, he said.	4511.070605621695
We have committed many errors and many sins.	9976.126876811144
A woman brought sin into the world.	6347.240558286005
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	12015.302629916225
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	12981.67183313592
A woman too brought Parnell low.	7734.053555137877
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	15509.522558030554
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	7978.186176239324
But I will fight for the right till the end.	10245.433861763446
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	12359.28489538982
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	9652.6972604977
— Well, sir, he began.	4538.461370309998
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	9509.734956681217
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	9431.520821097343
Perhaps I am wrong.	11980.699522191517
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	4486.519047553425
And here what will you learn more?	9267.046615300755
Mr Deasy shook his head.	6676.017854712342
— Who knows?	2729.1899912752933
he said.	2082.9626069148076
To learn one must be humble.	10396.225931040059
But life is the great teacher.	9863.782630541877
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	10261.597993460822
— As regards these, he began.	6752.085910262084
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	1705.3437728927372
You have two copies there.	6792.89376221735
If you can have them published at once.	9180.860622083823
_ Telegraph.	4942.729853783369
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	15273.501802947167
I know two editors slightly.	5537.911390557114
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	5282.013766611844
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	12982.372471797125
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	9150.592979507197
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	11093.461238568754
What are they?	6145.113562483685
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	8015.645278473005
There is no time to lose.	8328.540164605247
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	11944.535080368229
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	7041.525857982384
Thank you.	6315.299290613758
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	9726.029210068209
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	10786.225372258168
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	7740.192521918829
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	12540.236358112223
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	12139.65151336103
Still I will help him in his fight.	11924.88477135924
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	15585.587885593786
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	7063.211242602669
No more letters, I hope.	8627.507145593614
— Just one moment.	4721.242149697985
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	4571.1300646890295
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	10319.151113484762
— I just wanted to say, he said.	4382.601099723725
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	15395.341739009325
Do you know that?	3765.87834543339
No. And do you know why?	7731.708497600014
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	8943.670073404995
— Why, sir?	3425.4935891481905
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	8466.86784419698
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	9768.006719893785
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	10266.70561473915
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	12162.935091248168
That ’ s why.	1894.0139354104351
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	13126.190906034066
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	15242.993506349965
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	16883.448887228955
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	17356.98505688499
Limits of the diaphane.	17932.61452774436
But he adds: in bodies.	7495.307406262009
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	10079.11565740179
How?	2870.066306384097
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	12201.494350358118
Go easy.	10940.817986651611
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	15154.059729609056
Limit of the diaphane in.	17724.87334026543
Why in?	7196.881458368225
Diaphane, adiaphane.	18227.54902377354
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	12318.33042103515
Shut your eyes and see.	11729.388955362365
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	13231.793157483127
You are walking through it howsomever.	7850.225593500172
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	11583.29174846246
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	13096.65747880887
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	16635.124803265593
Open your eyes.	11746.291996393667
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	12778.908778704705
My ash sword hangs at my side.	11722.369886228631
Tap with it: they do.	11875.284368845265
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	13779.398384146132
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	16249.81104549519
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	13000.621575712505
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	17451.623842446083
Wild sea money.	15868.195079096857
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	17570.648302713715
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	13162.18537280076
Rhythm begins, you see.	14298.223463272881
I hear.	3014.012670382443
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	8872.392851107246
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	7708.232296696761
Open your eyes now.	12434.281959376936
I will.	2340.5706358512725
One moment.	5294.525690911976
Has all vanished since?	12681.168245145993
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	10936.303768723446
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	17216.031693751804
See now.	7983.677386086642
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	12336.611367534151
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	14473.545670982561
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	13601.721458443106
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	15885.885652416495
From the liberties, out for the day.	10060.98901117398
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	14914.02705692028
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	10430.012173399597
Creation from nothing.	14291.61809371746
What has she in the bag?	9368.575798655642
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	11270.831868365593
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	11115.179523658668
That is why mystic monks.	7134.107087117157
Will you be as gods?	10971.12939386544
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	15976.304393411037
Hello.	4249.911687445489
Kinch here.	15707.401234162882
Put me on to Edenville.	14298.161685211302
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	17279.93518182534
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	17162.064257603583
She had no navel.	5028.139827837136
Gaze.	11785.351918411056
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	16118.858640122
Womb of sin.	16807.8688531982
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	17162.064257603583
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	14303.915381069693
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	14172.775591756306
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	8872.392851107246
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	11849.077322274534
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	9811.685597074396
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	16682.958428308033
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	17076.136894926323
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	14682.313916695282
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	17279.93518182534
They are coming, waves.	6953.861286545196
The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.	11115.179523658668

My consubstantial father ’ s voice.	10674.724803301946
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately?	10707.507774245307

And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	12000.282547220066
O, weeping God, the things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	11168.88535217052
The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player.	10781.106889406488
Highly respectable gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir.	16331.141710601602
Yes, sir.	1491.5619158298528

Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ! I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.	15921.852001036057
They take me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.	12460.248375485022

A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.	10047.931632725

In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	13288.86365953085
Cleanchested.	19456.598729469286
He has washed the upper moiety.	6211.653988730664

He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_.	14175.688802568591
A bogoak frame over his bald head: Wilde ’ s _Requiescat_.	11583.31677769653

The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera.	10403.99829904407
Listen.	6177.770207457267
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	13981.30389350595
This wind is sweeter.	10798.446112970529

Beauty is not there.	14932.487582743664
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh ’ s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.	16594.209823215468
For whom?	7431.836760265275
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	8916.453222764361
A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars.	13229.507196431994

A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace (_descende! _), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	14001.44518569973
Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	15869.238682819405
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	10794.297200108751
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	16152.79588025226
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek.	17041.351916654137
Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back.	16051.953953143342

Isle of saints.	18227.54902377354

You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose.	11569.903702653795
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street.	13479.546213011472
_O si, certo! _ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw.	16375.675333192034
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women! _ What about that, eh?	15326.394759483723
What about what?	5187.344194954393
What else were they invented for?	9368.575798655642
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	16635.086093072554
I was young.	3267.148393725029
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face.	13172.524279912968

Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	15669.32562852088

Remembering thee, O Sion.	17724.87334026543
He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	10606.271257381437
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of brightness.	12444.201715278186
Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?	12604.03554168549
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	10408.806854828987
Turn back.	14193.453893600445
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	15978.067697011395
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	8653.760922898102
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	15327.495802976657
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	15551.32576810267
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	12371.933593962973
Who to clear it?	9827.298447216312
He has the key.	4189.76714090452
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	8119.534210614672
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	12886.900869707863
Call: no answer.	13498.003490640338
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	10578.481492221024
Take all, keep all.	13056.812122290823
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	11292.073580640365
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	14137.606984298267
The flood is following me.	7475.025159920183
I can watch it flow past from here.	8005.8643374356025
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	14223.241973685846
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	13128.227796854404
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	10916.932126969617
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	16644.041190546446
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	15585.587885593786
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	11936.469457192437
Hide gold there.	16807.8688531982
Try it.	8111.880526127519
You have some.	4759.799179378041
Sands and stones.	18227.54902377354
Heavy of the past.	14233.412627925942
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	13894.212333769912
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	15994.656627732702
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	8310.39875593264
Feefawfum.	19456.598729469286
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	9168.77625240336
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	12333.234547642382
Lord, is he going to attack me?	12864.521015686822
Respect his liberty.	16807.8688531982
You will not be master of others or their slave.	10593.969903772982
I have my stick.	4302.64888386966
Sit tight.	12340.567951090532
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	14045.187282380706
The two maries.	5018.269448422289
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	9813.218707667775
Peekaboo.	19456.598729469286
I see you.	3629.2328616885497
No, the dog.	5264.074647058816
He is running back to them.	5955.9957739085985
Who?	4459.212751717798
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	16842.048511082874
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	16959.24882930963
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	12535.466719037599
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	14681.068977487259
Famine, plague and slaughters.	17724.87334026543
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	13860.05133266944
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	12987.659219555215
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	10271.063880196996
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	10897.741156414968
Dog of my enemy.	16760.897092969924
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	10027.783840393884
_Terribilia meditans_.	18679.07077551165
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	11861.08857236919
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	12527.61519548256
Pretenders: live their lives.	17724.87334026543
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	14822.49169186287
All kings ’ sons.	8311.969521134488
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	16702.366946211594
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	11407.595707846944
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	11355.998219653744
House of...	11621.825703049853
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	11324.062772108771
Would you do what he did?	10845.31405400397
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	10047.931632725
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	17570.648302713715
Would you or would you not?	10845.31405400397
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	8855.29937000274
They are waiting for him now.	7748.636864022042
The truth, spit it out.	7458.8020956605915
I would want to.	5861.92346583866
I would try.	4764.354976474335
I am not a strong swimmer.	5323.653455812261
Water cold soft.	15868.195079096857
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	13334.501013801648
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	9430.744587733105
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	15454.83442247807
If I had land under my feet.	8056.575397173224
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	10194.022451473553
A drowning man.	6108.478345590255
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	12406.196483579759
I...	2010.4080556928288
With him together down...	10535.337865370506
I could not save her.	5537.767872400415
Waters: bitter death: lost.	17570.648302713715
A woman and a man.	6938.906152226889
I see her skirties.	4999.141540385054
Pinned up, I bet.	16727.42622563514
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	14697.720823345466
Looking for something lost in a past life.	13037.415381119392
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	16899.786054421136
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	8961.15907786967
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	9589.849946678749
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	12650.859930451417
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	12311.271795680139
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	12135.437873489916
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	14473.531547032875
Cocklepickers.	19456.598729469286
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	14019.742836944866
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	13324.783543591675
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	16842.048511082874
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	13378.989088737637
The carcass lay on his path.	8254.458994756533
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	13674.74027211154
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	16199.257205572154
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	11222.814622507607
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	14015.734607008744
He slunk back in a curve.	8282.810077087443
Doesn ’ t see me.	9303.898176961176
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	16399.09451540858
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	12356.24689288475
The simple pleasures of the poor.	8254.458994756533
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	12645.73563121988
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	14694.320317850235
Wait.	1374.254002664509
Street of harlots.	10225.679268481821
Remember.	7139.47612196162
Haroun al Raschid.	16807.8688531982
I am almosting it.	4096.128334867949
That man led me, spoke.	9090.268896781983
I was not afraid.	4280.660328552075
The melon he had he held against my face.	9975.267020722324
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	17932.61452774436
That was the rule, said.	6110.728819111336
Red carpet spread.	13814.400447318581
You will see who.	6049.644836504098
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	16654.630702959552
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	13770.226153886728
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	13153.519646091456
Spoils slung at her back.	17724.87334026543
About her windraw face hair trailed.	14198.982637419229
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	15771.461168324415
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	14685.443267158076
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	13746.398461627918
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	16799.849993254935
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	17216.031693751804
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	11604.674965335416
Couch a hogshead with me then.	17570.648302713715
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	7033.2986204173
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	17279.93518182534
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	17570.648302713715
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	14799.503916308087
Language no whit worse than his.	17570.648302713715
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	16983.53434559331
Passing now.	14855.255256694101
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	9507.376927886024
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	9778.071867880157
I am not.	2697.760932017172
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	12150.727887565497
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	10512.986157440577
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	16959.24882930963
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	13839.95466349412
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	12136.340022722363
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	17279.93518182534
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	11816.888630436475
Here.	2362.0757772639918
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	12713.918839716494
My tablets.	7629.7325899688285
Mouth to her kiss.	13044.860982597318
No. Must be two of em.	7731.708497600014
Glue em well.	18227.54902377354
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	13493.838329443013
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	12859.123317686288
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	17932.61452774436
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	13637.42658113386
Paper.	19456.598729469286
The banknotes, blast them.	7475.025159920183
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	11070.526111347472
Here.	2362.0757772639918
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	16032.227303004362
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	7973.139402617834
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	12135.437873489916
Why not endless till the farthest star?	10316.465370358328
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	16917.697281476372
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	15994.047171055383
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	11865.10351057293
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	17162.064257603583
Who watches me here?	9827.298447216312
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	12098.975824019213
Signs on a white field.	17724.87334026543
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	15184.17278218577
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	13647.061490651671
Hold hard.	8806.064324091374
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	15503.813364896736
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	16594.209823215468
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	11552.550072396138
Click does the trick.	16760.897092969924
You find my words dark.	9221.483806420649
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	17279.93518182534
Flutier.	19456.598729469286
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	14979.540264668292
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	11866.536698374883
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	13682.854605770754
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	15551.325775217909
She, she, she.	8932.73161892921
What she?	5310.3952380902765
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	12677.601946232935
Keen glance you gave her.	17724.87334026543
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	17356.98505688499
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	12828.679159522322
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	15710.001743080335
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	16351.752733035777
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	15316.311760780676
Where are your wits?	7214.537484702598
Touch me.	11288.065204224065
Soft eyes.	13656.980144780464
Soft soft soft hand.	14553.805056755707
I am lonely here.	4096.128334867949
O, touch me soon, now.	7225.819140813703
What is that word known to all men?	7638.240321547385
I am quiet here alone.	4999.459914418532
Sad too.	12492.20319340747
Touch, touch me.	13714.062609733974
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	13562.497564761588
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	12128.03886255564
_Et vidit Deus.	18227.54902377354
Et erant valde bona_.	16760.897092969924
Alo! _Bonjour_.	18227.54902377354
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	14861.027645517965
I am caught in this burning scene.	6521.124193946264
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	17356.98505688499
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	17010.718138155575
Pain is far.	15868.195079096857
And no more turn aside and brood.	6142.565999077392
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	12442.548770182553
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	11940.535003273475
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	11115.179523658668
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	13136.69460425034
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	15337.762432881917
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	8950.623691298822
He now will leave me.	7504.374075773835
And the blame?	3441.8741713616714
As I am.	6677.150550965753
As I am.	6677.150550965753
All or not at all.	8653.566179081627
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	13695.38964603929
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	11726.02524024795
Better get this job over quick.	11680.257910801653
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	14930.009780842476
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	17162.064257603583
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	13294.655584727132
And, spent, its speech ceases.	8434.529796513461
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	12240.294503144347
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	15295.185576930946
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	15410.793038171565
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	16277.97127148087
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	13262.730258697742
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	16399.01819706655
Five fathoms out there.	12966.423775746363
Full fathom five thy father lies.	14559.54209314761
At one, he said.	6138.666520074708
Found drowned.	16878.573427268955
High water at Dublin bar.	14298.161685211302
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	17010.718138155575
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	12256.292592180296
There he is.	4205.2203339835
Hook it quick.	16807.8688531982
Pull.	14336.178182593083
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	14172.17618733805
We have him.	6021.48520463659
Easy now.	18679.07077551165
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	16682.90235283324
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	13040.515652795793
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	13834.01452578417
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	15582.037618339233
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	16868.487024965427
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	9507.376927886024
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	17279.93518182534

_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	17451.623842446083
Just you give it a fair trial.	11313.853969890803
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	9316.809644546893
Come.	2476.0160925037276
I thirst.	4389.602684722832
Clouding over.	18679.07077551165
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	10658.610380725226
Thunderstorm.	19456.598729469286
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	16959.24882930963
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	9767.804498993848
Where?	1683.5310292764207
To evening lands.	8536.593002969352
Evening will find itself.	15393.126810427384
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	10268.517601489244
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	9779.877307433298
All days make their end.	9716.350077818355
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	11104.42419452645
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	13512.593173583171
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	16727.4985151238
_Già_.	12971.327416137423
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	9050.25299237729
_Già_.	12971.327416137423
My teeth are very bad.	10626.382741620842
Why, I wonder.	6865.444402556603
Feel.	8172.165736889734
That one is going too.	8084.29923338163
Shells.	19456.598729469286
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	15447.177366475227
That one.	4728.342606857698
This.	5384.0915161455
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	17724.87334026543
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	12306.336969461974
My handkerchief.	7629.7325899688285
He threw it.	4201.035961587195
I remember.	3104.0586636549992
Did I not take it up?	10590.255637817738
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	9068.591329301047
No, I didn ’ t.	6108.473871149929
Better buy one.	10285.071939094505
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	11297.447467638922
For the rest let look who will.	8971.114359887582
Behind.	13490.99621301991
Perhaps there is someone.	12818.243863230015
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	7899.980973523289
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	16799.833052722297
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	11874.748003971115
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	13036.591961140879
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	14740.289505984401
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	16883.448887228955
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	16983.53434559331
Made him feel a bit peckish.	15316.311760780676
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	15060.13528391999
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	8047.177966039527
Right.	4523.283768958867
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	10779.230291446736
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	12240.294503144347
Cup of tea soon.	14642.13991874213
Good.	3567.3665975662016
Mouth dry.	14193.453893600445
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	10010.147694477058
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	10606.209332405064
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	12380.524395892233
Prr.	12971.327416137423
Scratch my head.	16807.8688531982
Prr.	12971.327416137423
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	8473.640177850557
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	16403.77730276248
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	9623.557145756722
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	6109.680230095968
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	7552.619014829941
They call them stupid.	7781.034807371525
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	11730.107923515714
She understands all she wants to.	9646.922470147376
Vindictive too.	18679.07077551165
Cruel.	11785.351918411056
Her nature.	7552.434326675674
Curious mice never squeal.	14233.55612654143
Seem to like it.	17932.61452774436
Wonder what I look like to her.	11014.531307135041
Height of a tower?	17932.61452774436
No, she can jump me.	6425.710280498854
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	9590.187326975412
Afraid of the chookchooks.	15976.304393411037
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	8982.075218193386
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	13589.098981676832
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	10772.719054281843
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	13425.36540931041
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	9351.031406069143
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	11735.573774305829
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	12825.564617232294
Why?	1363.914055113649
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	11340.526303648494
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	12190.823574801643
He listened to her licking lap.	8282.810077087443
Ham and eggs, no.	15786.109314441857
No good eggs with this drouth.	10089.871202392082
Want pure fresh water.	12218.456590167541
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	16331.141710601602
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	16667.347011617076
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	13038.085327583733
While the kettle is boiling.	12429.020679382458
Why are their tongues so rough?	10906.422729012029
To lap better, all porous holes.	11450.160290395097
Nothing she can eat?	13127.503305506403
He glanced round him.	5647.376429406276
She might like something tasty.	8430.05229321425
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	15420.105647741242
Still perhaps: once in a way.	10993.629196979682
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	10432.232614206814
Be back in a minute.	11729.844999103672
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	11463.650809552168
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	12719.382538702373
Must get those settled really.	8905.2613696762
Pity.	7168.595020610842
All the way from Gibraltar.	7219.657071478235
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	16112.477388603033
Wonder what her father gave for it.	11014.531307135041
Old style.	9070.866143451834
Ah yes! of course.	10429.472789307507
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	15551.278730605616
Got a short knock.	9445.22925309156
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	15071.924411663169
Yes, sir.	1491.5619158298528
At Plevna that was.	10293.63476620644
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	12098.818737216214
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	12362.496474068139
Now that was farseeing.	8856.738156911913
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	12929.397646070856
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	17932.61452774436
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	15898.98236476088
Course they do.	11952.637771794745
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	12274.88914147691
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	8549.741696140327
White slip of paper.	13303.535250527691
Quite safe.	11699.385526317174
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	10484.91235418943
In the trousers I left off.	7033.2986204173
Must get it.	6953.720284764192
Potato I have.	16807.8688531982
Creaky wardrobe.	18679.07077551165
No use disturbing her.	7127.369556613319
She turned over sleepily that time.	9646.922470147376
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	12700.575465580376
Looked shut.	15707.401234162882
All right till I come back anyhow.	10452.240549557622
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	10924.013032962039
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	9308.459811583292
Be a warm day I fancy.	11906.830401412506
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	17356.98505688499
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	15512.608474234135
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	10245.69211073413
Make a picnic of it.	11596.331742664115
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	12135.437873489916
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	16899.786054421136
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	15204.334033927893
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	16983.76268114849
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	14048.758565398595
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	16142.552006028765
Wander through awned streets.	17932.61452774436
Turbaned faces going by.	17932.61452774436
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	16076.698333771375
Cries of sellers in the streets.	15876.99308527025
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	14766.136976064034
Dander along all day.	17932.61452774436
Might meet a robber or two.	12880.307995164145
Well, meet him.	6612.543702763758
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	11098.14587230142
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	11270.831868365593
I pass on.	5276.775370149495
Fading gold sky.	18227.54902377354
A mother watches me from her doorway.	9507.376927886024
She calls her children home in their dark language.	10768.467903399
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	14559.54209314761
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	15410.851312724897
Strings.	19456.598729469286
Listen.	6177.770207457267
I pass.	3966.4837786130074
Probably not a bit like it really.	15184.17278218577
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	13951.587029053171
Sunburst on the titlepage.	17932.61452774436
He smiled, pleasing himself.	6053.517259649625
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	13025.70075384824
He prolonged his pleased smile.	7504.374075773835
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	14048.497148779501
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	8421.059352692379
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	11282.070502008199
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	14316.916560244272
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	13563.874905466651
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	11617.365217064405
g.	12971.327416137423
as position.	16878.573427268955
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	13662.861895168895
Baldhead over the blind.	17932.61452774436
Cute old codger.	16807.8688531982
No use canvassing him for an ad.	9433.936598139066
Still he knows his own business best.	10865.643685442927
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	13156.822237227561
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	15870.264746657882
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	6741.085156686574
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	6316.958594484319
Do you know what?	3725.625613236436
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	12338.421226245811
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	15188.16286951117
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	13282.259978312359
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	14814.029879103113
— Good day to you.	4047.817941759426
— Lovely weather, sir.	6373.156737984755
— ’ Tis all that.	6753.184526697845
Where do they get the money?	9434.365754086388
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	15582.037618339233
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	12113.404516007116
Then think of the competition.	9779.406899407832
General thirst.	13656.980144780464
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	13124.181080249919
Save it they can ’ t.	14281.898316160363
Off the drunks perhaps.	14233.55612654143
Put down three and carry five.	14559.54209314761
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	9616.097483042859
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	15313.485572694599
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	17010.808946578814
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	11725.7302215495
Say ten barrels of stuff.	13056.812122290823
Say he got ten per cent off.	13759.066380780712
O more.	6106.672226005546
Fifteen.	9780.093555557632
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	8182.326313497983

Slieve Bloom.	18679.07077551165
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	12144.692522698298
Fifteen multiplied by.	14188.216383417554
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	11921.284113977003
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	13454.81037092316
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	11270.831868365593
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	8130.407688606406
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	14901.247565747417
Chapped: washingsoda.	18227.54902377354
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	9533.656568022232
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	8522.055532165854
Woods his name is.	17932.61452774436

Strong pair of arms.	15393.126810427384
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	17570.648302713715
She does whack it, by George.	9790.52164949861
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	9178.078087529702
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	16667.347011617076
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	11688.574334979496
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	12159.041578720957
Moses Montefiore.	16878.573427268955
I thought he was.	5862.041681955401
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	17279.93518182534
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	12041.228077216434
A young white heifer.	6424.119774422382
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	15555.821557495561
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	11367.416655015291
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	10058.358154390517
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	12686.770656745939
— Now, my miss, he said.	5353.304199550693
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	12402.52646245979
— Thank you, my miss.	4037.6060114600887
And one shilling threepence change.	7114.570793114569
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	4344.299241510347
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	13756.75286103699
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	13559.75776121367
Hurry up, damn it.	15550.35106674391
Make hay while the sun shines.	13905.662299184823
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	9638.29914779087
Sodachapped hands.	18679.07077551165
Crusted toenails too.	18227.54902377354
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	16654.630702959552
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	10781.081801603794
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	13355.306710030074
They like them sizeable.	7146.064726837139
Prime sausage.	18679.07077551165
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	12336.275114987324
— Threepence, please.	5817.3251072490575
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	11008.929882870088
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	13754.766916924013
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	13309.650252872634
— Thank you, sir.	2475.6314183478403
Another time.	11935.765987958684
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	9765.891360909822
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	8173.109145438142
No: better not: another time.	9626.965374483882
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	6484.077257799705
— Good morning, sir.	3063.5419402716134
No sign.	6159.577739645505
Gone.	4782.2098951201715
What matter?	5310.3952380902765
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	8435.66695453462
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	14894.997898413925
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	13260.962944753192
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	16158.125825015217
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	16682.90235283324
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	13838.615136701785
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	16682.90235283324
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	14388.204736798549
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	13907.535970899482
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	13818.179777460593
Bleibtreustrasse <NUM>, Berlin, W.	14045.172928425778
<NUM>.	4206.88139636909
Nothing doing.	10571.668153790324
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	8008.94222954725
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	18679.07077551165
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	16682.90235283324
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	16682.90235283324
I have a few left from Andrews.	5863.012130115345
Molly spitting them out.	11772.687689473321
Knows the taste of them now.	15024.066288223417
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	17451.623842446083
Citrons too.	18679.07077551165
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	11364.902300434585
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	9068.620815265193
Pleasant evenings we had then.	16727.42622563514
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	11751.355658920349
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	15325.6645587402
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	11370.730893161048
Always the same, year after year.	13590.163994936875
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	11370.092057475593
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	17279.93518182534
Must be without a flaw, he said.	6566.1786000578895
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	15339.05602359687
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	16842.048511082874
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	5358.0314608315275
How do you?	3733.2280558124417
Doesn ’ t see.	8621.75386285998
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	15509.522558030554
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	11057.443774365138
Watering cart.	18679.07077551165
To provoke the rain.	9530.31373028954
On earth as it is in heaven.	11777.815922006897
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	8054.58398343928
Grey.	15443.024084639697
Far.	5148.297548157808
No, not like that.	5614.44684034537
A barren land, bare waste.	8872.392851107246
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	16351.752733035806
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	12703.063643271962
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	16597.55237268468
All dead names.	7856.268068370497
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	10924.775245717736
Old now.	9070.866143451834
It bore the oldest, the first race.	10854.766665942077
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	12535.466719037599
The oldest people.	5442.1386306936365
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	16917.697281476372
It lay there now.	7665.507817060794
Now it could bear no more.	11875.284368845265
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	14036.434977815277
Desolation.	19456.598729469286
Grey horror seared his flesh.	16053.975985553223
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	17041.351916654137
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	15909.15741155057
Well, I am here now.	6368.902825543157
Yes, I am here now.	5275.227717891919
Morning mouth bad images.	15976.304393411037
Got up wrong side of the bed.	10802.842025030315
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	12314.5399330957
On the hands down.	4239.736167404337
Blotchy brown brick houses.	17932.61452774436
Number eighty still unlet.	15393.126810427384
Why is that?	6822.494151957712
Valuation is only twentyeight.	17932.61452774436
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	17076.136894926323
Plasters on a sore eye.	17724.87334026543
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	13609.038509329552
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	12691.822129819979
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	15837.09345903805
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	16983.53434559331
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	13132.22488616561
He stooped and gathered them.	6683.538281061451
Mrs Marion Bloom.	6128.936731746779
His quickened heart slowed at once.	10004.661937286033
Bold hand.	10199.686973929367
Mrs Marion.	4209.373312521336
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	12431.951658514481
— Who are the letters for?	4917.317552622968
He looked at them.	3627.3015737364517
Mullingar.	9728.691757493107
Milly.	7586.596070254145
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	10344.420788006337
And a letter for you.	6959.639666047686
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	11554.800416495364
— Do you want the blind up?	4932.999891473101
— That do?	2451.9334177645032
he asked, turning.	7106.1922255914515
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	9612.35786421944
— She got the things, she said.	5819.327735032774
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	12285.684483421463
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	6880.265455328425
I ’ m parched.	2058.5292253760767
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	4321.005936680635
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	12277.395839970914
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	12239.198840510282
— Scald the teapot.	5817.3251072490575
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	11104.001283435113
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	13567.313074902642
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	15978.404271297204
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	14176.45708848696
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	13739.065248854813
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	13759.158876374153
Kosher.	12971.327416137423
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	11774.553323216514
Pepper.	16997.075953601572
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	11061.182623913306
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	15514.152453135575
The tea was drawn.	6549.046155587141
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	10803.853923993442
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	14369.103464748194
No, wait: four.	6198.798304565047
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	8873.879392965651
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	16271.04294698232
He smiled, pouring.	5120.421335088295
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	9110.658555904236
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	9336.681347177971
Poor old professor Goodwin.	10454.240230240934
Dreadful old case.	15868.195079096857
Still he was a courteous old chap.	10865.643685442927
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	17215.988293285944
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	7542.366757475108
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	10684.927453733439
Sex breaking out even then.	17724.87334026543
Pert little piece she was.	17724.87334026543
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	12703.352840358732
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	16194.737672074629
Everything on it?	15175.67984183378
Yes.	992.2748593504894
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	10819.081209577245
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	16298.611116201288
— What a time you were! she said.	6270.710800990109
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	12254.718452242674
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	12840.218585308325
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	11270.831868365593
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	9769.55813070682
— Who was the letter from?	5362.332261270601
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
Bold hand.	10199.686973929367
Marion.	13490.860194508374
— O, Boylan, she said.	3158.186075153184
He ’ s bringing the programme.	3521.300646318881
— What are you singing?	3264.3741977681975
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	7552.619014829941
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	15691.996525785127
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	11669.437649043693
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	15313.485572694599
Like foul flowerwater.	9577.811994938531
— Would you like the window open a little?	8779.996578940654
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	12539.415506727815
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	8833.309282559494
I didn ’ t see the paper.	5522.081393013274
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	16937.421557610043
No?	2792.4361250158504
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	12113.404516007116
— No: that book.	4632.600181258296
Other stocking.	11935.765987958684
Her petticoat.	7552.434326675674
— It must have fell down, she said.	5773.554130564061
He felt here and there.	6213.231207037116
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	14642.13991874213
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	11318.622325546949
Not in the bed.	8012.494729344261
Must have slid down.	8033.122657990971
He stooped and lifted the valance.	7484.420384204816
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	11413.09423104223
— Show here, she said.	5026.533643588817
I put a mark in it.	8096.792197711133
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	6718.14867962764
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	14756.814451633682
— Met him what?	5817.3251072490575
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
What does that mean?	6034.39211747327
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	9638.29914779087
— Metempsychosis?	3118.5687368668796
— Yes.	607.5585411172303
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	7877.800492185213
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	5464.095504173992
That means the transmigration of souls.	9912.933555173273
— O, rocks! she said.	3792.826688455648

Dolphin ’ s Barn.	6352.75472016918
He turned over the smudged pages.	5955.9957739085985
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	17451.623842446083
Hello.	4249.911687445489

Trapeze at Hengler ’ s.	17724.87334026543
Had to look the other way.	12309.070735345242
Mob gaping.	18679.07077551165
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	17216.11849107316
Families of them.	18227.54902377354
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	17570.648302713715
That we live after death.	8696.235759046831
Our souls.	8508.4024235067
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	11396.254581467092
Dignam ’ s soul...	10918.611673532341
— Did you finish it?	4240.347701396601
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
— Yes, she said.	1750.3472827417083
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	5622.3467780596975
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	11915.295209628113
— Never read it.	4993.517422394024
Do you want another?	6067.422875737492
— Yes.	607.5585411172303
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	13596.6552794571
Nice name he has.	10673.912618874603
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	11563.838809629331
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	12782.418550553522
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	15948.578055914662
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	12006.257073044984
They call it reincarnation.	7781.034807371525
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	12875.481264231144
They say we have forgotten it.	8449.724806191347
Some say they remember their past lives.	13590.163994936875
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	9975.267020722324
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	13038.085327583733
An example would be better.	11161.966837253718
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	9107.247522908538
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	16331.141710601602
Tea before you put milk in.	15669.322221546165
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	12304.7220915156
Three and six I gave for the frame.	12255.228548269437
She said it would look nice over the bed.	10110.902986215284
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	16614.95473623039
He turned the pages back.	5147.906823250853
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	11431.588528227647
What they called nymphs, for example.	9539.012551873897
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	12082.782711526488
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	11502.162947363016
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	4927.768520219322
Did you leave anything on the fire?	10006.663311980672
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	5607.128740383547
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	14195.747971231584
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	16614.986150192934
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	14398.1901145516
Only a little burnt.	10105.524446714033
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	12460.448900576182
Cup of tea now.	14642.13991874213
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	11136.978707189392
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	11563.478713203984
Done to a turn.	14932.487582743664
A mouthful of tea.	7210.75792986819
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	12003.353711992779
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	9033.6785522652
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	13558.311029797824
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	16124.289314517251
It suits me splendid.	8201.386601223077
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	15585.587885593786
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	10599.513925960819
They are lovely.	4918.450567423833
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	8228.070883167145
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	10915.427805721041
Will send when developed.	11937.313751103518
We did great biz yesterday.	10111.88095965841
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	14233.204805434121
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	12217.557898734309
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	14256.340448617415
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	7757.868681341832
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	11500.367686332136
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	14457.798869585547
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	12461.526053113283
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	9957.139043038525
S.	2246.5143522196063
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	13575.879071799758
M.	2002.7549511405832
Fifteen yesterday.	13656.980144780464
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	14960.601221885086
Her first birthday away from home.	10620.47315914389
Separation.	19456.598729469286
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	15107.561934002502
Jolly old woman.	16807.8688531982
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	13691.682186263079
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	11233.78115042426
Well, God is good, sir.	8578.70175014874
She knew at once.	6713.260482993411
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	8816.234573890866
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	11061.29552097042
Excuse bad writing.	12064.145178301107
Hurry.	10940.661888558341
Piano downstairs.	15707.401234162882
Coming out of her shell.	13292.028952853927
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	17216.031693751804
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	11242.705720675067
Saucebox.	19456.598729469286
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	11622.65271160677
Twelve and six a week.	16053.975985553223
Not much.	6173.9202238716825
Still, she might do worse.	9343.118784232536
Music hall stage.	13492.86464334258
Young student.	6956.706697141707
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	10087.155930884759
Then he read the letter again: twice.	8689.291762971337
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	8591.069148920225
But if not?	6673.01010051354
No, nothing has happened.	6198.798304565047
Wait in any case till it does.	12290.247137795664
A wild piece of goods.	8117.899790053171
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	10804.509857805248
Destiny.	12971.327416137423
Ripening now.	18679.07077551165
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	9049.771654908292
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	15410.793038171565
Anemic a little.	18227.54902377354
Was given milk too long.	12357.336220593894
Damned old tub pitching about.	15550.35106674391
Not a bit funky.	6999.735304658139
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	12988.64627991084
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	11307.266069331758
Seaside girls.	18679.07077551165
Torn envelope.	16878.573427268955
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	16118.235762307171
Friend of the family.	16760.897092969924
Swurls, he says.	15976.304393411037
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	17356.98505688499
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	10074.171798305715
Milly too.	10200.303926238063
Young kisses: the first.	13566.671310138481
Far away now past.	11852.40123313142
Mrs Marion.	4209.373312521336
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	16605.27055147329
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	11252.65454803661
Will happen, yes.	11157.329403316393
Prevent.	19456.598729469286
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	13351.209462015855
Will happen too.	10314.026557980322
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	8677.530799275153
Useless to move now.	13956.798509731774
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	16702.366946211594
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	14559.54209314761
Better where she is down there: away.	13038.085327583733
Occupy her.	18679.07077551165
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	15184.274856540984
Might take a trip down there.	12243.807218099535
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	17279.93518182534
Six weeks off, however.	14298.161685211302
Might work a press pass.	12429.55752372533
Or through M ’ Coy.	9278.789199452394
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	12385.8821738237
She looked back at him, mewing.	9250.365447541144
Wants to go out.	13303.468192195103
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	12659.792422353856
Let her wait.	8593.05328764482
Has the fidgets.	10469.991100894957
Electric.	16997.075953601572
Thunder in the air.	14233.627877477811
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	14291.327896804263
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	10756.497416641132
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	7543.032205872066
The cat mewed to him.	5898.533072639763
— Miaow! he said in answer.	8239.330260393675
Wait till I ’ m ready.	8391.496790235502
Heaviness: hot day coming.	17724.87334026543
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	11791.711233882357
A paper.	4762.787687825449
He liked to read at stool.	7873.501926046016
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	14240.663785924206
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	9350.74340163698
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	11407.660413132187
The cat went up in soft bounds.	7757.958088085536
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	11814.638154130656
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	17076.171333244798
Come.	2476.0160925037276
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	10918.142542737553
No sound.	4544.530949956641
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	13659.238031252198
The maid was in the garden.	8254.458994756533
Fine morning.	13656.980144780464
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	10650.659633951438
Make a summerhouse here.	10931.271611209784
Scarlet runners.	18679.07077551165
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	12083.886189664727
A coat of liver of sulphur.	8872.392851107246
All soil like that without dung.	10383.476819970887
Household slops.	18679.07077551165
Loam, what is this that is?	17451.623842446083
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	11680.312421563716
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	14904.06795516492
Mulch of dung.	18227.54902377354
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	13720.578925774835
Dirty cleans.	16878.573427268955
Ashes too.	16878.573427268955
Reclaim the whole place.	17932.61452774436
Grow peas in that corner there.	17570.648302713715
Lettuce.	19456.598729469286
Always have fresh greens then.	12851.098087836783
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	10986.296178364646
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	9912.933555173273
He walked on.	2664.3076707937253
Where is my hat, by the way?	8541.80096309431
Must have put it back on the peg.	10720.591815127686
Or hanging up on the floor.	9782.85746877516
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	14517.328886331621
Hallstand too full.	18227.54902377354
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	14298.161685211302
Picking up the letters.	15665.739701619705
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	17724.87334026543
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	14766.186608803248
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	16702.366946211594
Just had a wash and brushup.	11941.362500301237
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	13288.226273816646
Tara street.	14855.255256694101
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	12530.635081919774
O ’ Brien.	3200.010655243422
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	16112.477388603033
Agendath what is it?	13213.26305404629
Now, my miss.	8856.73816366566
Enthusiast.	19456.598729469286
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	10000.20027684444
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	13278.345893047865
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	9016.517220944786
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	16937.421557610043
The king was in his countinghouse.	7846.551857257705
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	16937.421557610043
Something new and easy.	11157.329403316393
No great hurry.	7503.861566893145
Keep it a bit.	11622.294287251765
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	13197.121153457563
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	17162.104194085827
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	12787.354730629624
Three and a half.	10039.732817179372
Three pounds three.	10064.379871478468
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	10044.52737172106
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	16368.456897166903
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	16790.99485282068
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	12715.473906347313
No, just right.	5264.074647058816
So. Ah! Costive.	9286.378237820945
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	10691.049044173882
Life might be so.	13498.003490640338
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	12708.5330223187
Print anything now.	18227.54902377354
Silly season.	12492.20319340747
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	9928.442177637236
Neat certainly.	18679.07077551165
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	16609.856668520133
Begins and ends morally.	16760.897092969924
_Hand in hand_.	18227.54902377354
Smart.	15443.024084639697
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	13408.924715468018
Might manage a sketch.	11852.99849689722

Which?	10172.32245475799
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	14590.604187081237
Dislike dressing together.	15175.67984183378
Nicked myself shaving.	18227.54902377354
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	17162.064257603583

What had Gretta Conroy on?	7824.418695885448
What possessed me to buy this comb?	9978.5550117665
<URL>.	4272.710711296956
I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	4122.03295422184
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	10589.29457045306
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	17215.988293285944
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	15710.474377514702
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	16140.704445732485
Washing her teeth.	16807.8688531982
That was the first night.	5301.033401037868
Her fansticks clicking.	8833.109756411148
Is that Boylan well off?	8494.714024034409
He has money.	3453.0226496925425
Why?	1363.914055113649
No use humming then.	7127.369556613319
Allude to it.	18227.54902377354
Strange kind of music that last night.	15762.484269390725
The mirror was in shadow.	7475.025159920183
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	12627.126933178246
Peering into it.	18227.54902377354
Lines in her eyes.	15665.818684095646
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	10359.32896051411
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	15762.484269390725
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	14928.251229729789
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	17076.136894926323
Still, true to life also.	9343.118784232536
Day: then the night.	14084.625240398014
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	11129.074309908361
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	10398.409097755273
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	12161.057422144635
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	13085.268052300344
What time is the funeral?	6576.427401576305
Better find out in the paper.	11680.257910801633
The bells of George ’ s church.	6894.372018377571
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	10952.661417588197
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	9739.85023784344
There again: the overtone following through the air.	12058.320423914838
A third.	4762.787687825449
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	14584.958325913656
Could have given that address too.	13659.238031252198
And past the sailors ’ home.	8620.480584613277
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	9431.430687320139
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	14564.668481999277
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	12886.900869707863
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	13062.157973732648
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	12885.948182971199
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	16682.90235283324
Come home to ma, da.	11812.36539146831
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	17279.9827036549
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	9928.442177637236
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	16644.041190546446
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	8620.480584613277
At eleven it is.	10293.63476620644
Time enough.	6518.005128700658
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	15016.253635022957
Corny.	9535.122774413201
Met her once in the park.	13973.739309591621
What a lark.	5349.729168136676
Police tout.	14855.255256694101
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	13214.153517303912
O, surely he bagged it.	6515.840354150209
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	16702.366946211594
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	10665.158752405081
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	14677.526433476645
Rather warm.	13656.980144780464
Tea.	9031.408469903961
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	9620.959240420536
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	11513.721775550224
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	15197.20057877511
Very warm morning.	12182.885842249987
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	14972.849525221824
Just there.	8627.549513770597
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	10573.109153743479
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	12928.319548790763
So warm.	7577.763833649201
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	10631.502477676791
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	12779.88616685269
The far east.	5442.1386306936365
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	15758.752944821197
Wonder is it like that.	9256.645627860835
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	15182.93951356525
Sleep six months out of twelve.	16702.366946211594
Too hot to quarrel.	11696.042057554145
Influence of the climate.	17932.61452774436
Lethargy.	16997.075953601572
Flowers of idleness.	15868.195079096857
The air feeds most.	5621.617405779097
Azotes.	19456.598729469286
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	17932.61452774436
Sensitive plants.	16878.573427268955
Waterlilies.	19456.598729469286
Petals too tired to.	17932.61452774436
Sleeping sickness in the air.	13722.514226974665
Walk on roseleaves.	13814.400447318581
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	16158.125825015217
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	11103.823133172622
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	13905.403891626991
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	12123.97285906772
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	13488.252193708624
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	11139.845686458111
It ’ s a law something like that.	4262.050065010027
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	17279.93518182534
The college curriculum.	5442.1386306936365
Cracking curriculum.	16878.573427268955
What is weight really when you say the weight?	8726.346898802067
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	15316.253852478569
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	15071.758639703854
They all fall to the ground.	8188.439573070849
The earth.	3725.095356282331
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	7012.68443171129
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	7014.549002256425
How did she walk with her sausages?	9353.084587095957
Like that something.	7258.887639508879
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	14458.764852137145
Careless air: just drop in to see.	16667.347011617076
Per second per second.	13956.728152149795
Per second for every second it means.	15948.04205195143
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	12119.7054861499
Too late box.	8761.710586825116
Post here.	16878.573427268955
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	11527.425057002853
— Are there any letters for me?	6495.941634102412
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	15660.36299007302
No answer probably.	6919.411981522894
Went too far last time.	16727.42622563514
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	11413.09423104223
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	10427.781043447638
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	13223.307928445276
O.	1174.1571553791387
Westland Row, City.	14642.13991874213
Answered anyhow.	18679.07077551165
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	11940.535003273475
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	8077.015123315575
Castoff soldier.	18679.07077551165
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	11242.351430383735
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	6437.472198271109
Pointed cuffs.	18679.07077551165
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	7386.1193221983585
Redcoats.	19456.598729469286
Too showy.	9838.938135192795
That must be why the women go after them.	11396.003882918189
Uniform.	16997.075953601572
Easier to enlist and drill.	16727.42622563514
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	16298.653988498372
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	16868.487024965427
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	14440.640581436473
Mark time.	14193.453893600445
Table: able.	16807.8688531982
Bed: ed.	18227.54902377354
The King ’ s own.	7475.057464097719
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	12240.590813791787
A mason, yes.	7210.75792986819
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	8358.381206422346
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	15551.32576810267
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	13427.178295070884
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	11638.37905296933
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	12074.250951434256
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	12948.96427078159
No. M ’ Coy.	5319.2799497154465
Get rid of him quickly.	12505.304740148655
Take me out of my way.	13447.298601703531
Hate company when you.	15393.126810427384
— Hello, Bloom.	2458.886311987475
Where are you off to?	7355.94073095124
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	3819.58518220605
Nowhere in particular.	18227.54902377354
— How ’ s the body?	5029.562631381483
— Fine.	2902.1771678372525
How are you?	5574.459880134201
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	5291.959244214573
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	12604.763182525445
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	2560.4688624996274
Poor Dignam, you know.	9156.121572899521
The funeral is today.	6549.046155587141
— To be sure, poor fellow.	5986.697887544194
So it is.	8166.976190181595
What time?	3646.1419343136763
A photo it isn ’ t.	8872.392851107246
A badge maybe.	6108.478345590255
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	8735.859244373984
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	5873.429338915032
Eleven, is it?	14553.878424276523
I only heard it last night.	7810.831939327538
Who was telling me?	5952.702217721335
Holohan.	16997.075953601572
You know Hoppy?	4948.173593226032
— I know.	1389.352412335653
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	10838.664873613368
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	9975.267020722324
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	13812.632768214515
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	16594.209823215468
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	16635.086093072554
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	10953.30520463129
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	14388.204736798549
Handsome is and handsome does.	16053.975985553223
Reserved about to yield.	17932.61452774436
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	9614.294651306222
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	15637.67658043215
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	10369.006484353324
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	13048.332348085036
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	17570.71474456905
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	10316.853873635357
In came Hoppy.	6960.639023770248
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	16819.419911419274
Clearly I can see today.	17724.87334026543
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	17570.648302713715
Talking of one thing or another.	13459.251734138245
Lady ’ s hand.	12218.08720145879
Which side will she get up?	13777.494126570553
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	9831.8426800818
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	11586.250331273503
High brown boots with laces dangling.	14559.54209314761
Wellturned foot.	18679.07077551165
What is he foostering over that change for?	7638.240321547385
Sees me looking.	15498.762615744456
Eye out for other fellow always.	17570.648302713715
Good fallback.	8275.153022040167
Two strings to her bow.	11514.972014569763
— _Why? _ I said.	6351.066316972726
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	14335.716810126527
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	16702.366946211594
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	896.7288464238603
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	10492.979610125976
Getting up in a minute.	15150.556721689882
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	7876.371930716473
He said.	3034.8310067019447
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	9803.238722226477
And, faith, he filled up.	8434.529796513461
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	17932.61452774436
I said.	3966.4837786130074
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	8449.371487406546
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	10071.332933465694
_Yes, _ he said.	17724.949940336057
_He ’ s gone.	11980.276828697708
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	8078.013835009814
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	12962.93260350194
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	14152.810879641811
Lost it.	15707.401234162882
Curse your noisy pugnose.	15976.304393411037
Feels locked out of it.	13722.6327910196
Paradise and the peri.	16760.897092969924
Always happening like that.	12323.296396078802
The very moment.	5442.1386306936365
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	14625.446973021693
Her friend covering the display of.	11172.584058815377
_Esprit de corps_.	18227.54902377354
Well, what are you gaping at?	8973.994622386806
Another gone.	11935.765987958684
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	5894.030441203917
The tram passed.	5442.1386306936365
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	13028.66943650352
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	16983.53434559331
— Wife well, I suppose?	6258.245306832452
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	8607.081947411021
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	2389.038057044783
Tiptop, thanks.	16807.8688531982
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	10650.739565916443
Incomplete.	9728.691757493107
With it an abode of bliss.	6043.335337801734
— My missus has just got an engagement.	7008.026846642817
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	11946.190737664232
Valise tack again.	16807.8688531982
By the way no harm.	7048.533459799733
I ’ m off that, thanks.	3766.915755671037
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	7487.360518421219
— My wife too, he said.	4424.486449757845
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	11001.110578365082
— That so?	1617.7119198771989
M ’ Coy said.	3912.9960320687073
Glad to hear that, old man.	13241.628920434592
Who ’ s getting it up?	5294.821859713745
Mrs Marion Bloom.	6128.936731746779
Not up yet.	8635.62183246531
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	15837.412554638748
No book.	6159.577739645505
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	17279.93518182534
Dark lady and fair man.	15150.622186653598
Letter.	14336.178182593083
Cat furry black ball.	16760.897092969924
Torn strip of envelope.	16760.897092969924
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	13196.176213087416
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	7406.338968728747
_Sweeeet song_.	18679.07077551165
There ’ s a committee formed.	4283.159668474655
Part shares and part profits.	10985.358072498344
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	10515.721061809558
— O, well, he said.	2787.944726429927
That ’ s good news.	3465.8609307746915
He moved to go.	5478.37872355234
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	5696.307418565849
Meet you knocking around.	16760.897092969924
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	896.7288464238603
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	5228.12171579538
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	9827.819185074923
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	7514.852885410641
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	11387.798676983864
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	11368.855984361518
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	5953.862052895891
That ’ ll be all right.	2735.026407338429
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	5944.96827696037
Thanks, old man.	9723.283038409762
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	5584.2846349644815
Well, tolloll.	5505.518236913404
Just C.	8627.549513770597
P.	1184.1224665332682
M ’ Coy will do.	7613.191228522634
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	7044.39065243057
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	10710.62504744311
The quick touch.	5442.1386306936365
Soft mark.	13656.980144780464
I ’ d like my job.	3796.8205082431505
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	16682.90235283324
Leather.	19456.598729469286
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	17215.988293285944
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	15627.68612899848
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	6681.592035388911
My missus has just got an.	9645.775669131794
Reedy freckled soprano.	18227.54902377354
Cheeseparing nose.	18679.07077551165
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	14210.793451538484
No guts in it.	8559.348879233634
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	9039.550531408158
Softsoaping.	19456.598729469286
Give you the needle that would.	11318.863232218702
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	8448.151393385426
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	15234.091094890931
Against my grain somehow.	15393.126810427384
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	15024.066288223417
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	9790.695674805003
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	13144.508739184059
Your wife and my wife.	12098.292517801228
Wonder is he pimping after me?	10469.69997196562
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	9259.924428486425
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	16249.892973942096
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	17724.87334026543
No, he ’ s going on straight.	7074.013110675741
Hello.	4249.911687445489
_Leah_ tonight.	18679.07077551165
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	9737.402576286491
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	17724.87334026543
Male impersonator.	18679.07077551165
Perhaps he was a woman.	12544.251882502062
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	9495.175603444217
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	12945.608421578703
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	14933.83569818263
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	15637.633581627138
And Ristori in Vienna.	7424.17538465336
What is this the right name is?	7010.44966748602
By Mosenthal it is.	9966.473182064097
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	11943.420051900062
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	15858.63371394115
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	13819.243977896054
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	13356.33141385847
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	10014.037928950833
No use thinking of it any more.	9433.936598139066
Nosebag time.	18679.07077551165
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	13043.532204512325
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	10929.616655453876
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	14572.803834199196
Their Eldorado.	9746.617166046197
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	14700.965610828522
Too full for words.	8342.668058439986
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	12293.382938946053
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	17076.136894926323
Might be happy all the same that way.	11648.580454502273
Good poor brutes they look.	11131.094344021754
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	12030.027955214537
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	11092.411328984155
Might just walk into her here.	12880.307995164145
The lane is safer.	6549.046155587141
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	6402.981515311445
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	14775.430373562524
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	13280.643678322645
_Voglio e non_.	15498.762615744456
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	11024.731411027631
Sociable.	19456.598729469286
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	16667.347011617076
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	11129.096754481614
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	11403.356341327024
No - one.	3226.65960798326
Meade ’ s timberyard.	14642.13991874213
Piled balks.	16878.573427268955
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	13355.306710030074
Not a sinner.	6392.481860538492
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	14985.415696313317
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	11861.08857236919
Pity to disturb them.	13714.062609733974
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	17115.978107251347
Open it.	13208.696921829242
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	12167.211046401384
She liked mignonette.	6983.769204948485
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	11937.373937672202
And Mr?	4496.169258815002
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	8549.71295838215
A flower.	4762.787687825449
I think it ’ s a.	6219.910922958716
Not annoyed then?	8635.62183246531
What does she say?	6456.243192215237
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	14846.976113177227
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	8228.050140750089
Why did you enclose the stamps?	8059.558445303015
I am awfully angry with you.	5805.441354646574
I do wish I could punish you for that.	7893.728939015298
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	6320.108146975932
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	11731.434596062878
I do wish I could do something for you.	8407.099428587888
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	11865.832236583341
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	9050.246070803832
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	12749.450870991748
I think of you so often you have no idea.	9217.254276204741
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	9647.761200081246
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	15337.933878442595
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	14151.884784141434
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	14343.133887463362
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	14634.303256916302
Then I will tell you all.	5412.687692652475
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	14507.59084300839
today.	19456.598729469286
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	14388.204736798549
S.	2246.5143522196063
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	11865.255313139347
I want to know.	3272.106177144094
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	12621.499372624818
They like it because no - one can hear.	10461.462288591567
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	11033.416357938197
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	13176.74404380489
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	16348.271560759309
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	15014.054874447205
Weak joy opened his lips.	15550.35106674391
Changed since the first letter.	17724.87334026543
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	11639.243823463528
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	15363.81308972372
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	12188.017827234404
Thank you: not having any.	12846.570254215916
Usual love scrimmage.	16807.8688531982
Then running round corners.	8960.410066068014
Bad as a row with Molly.	12565.279343515313
Cigar has a cooling effect.	16727.42622563514
Narcotic.	19456.598729469286
Go further next time.	12553.74482835707
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	15107.052136983279
Brutal, why not?	17932.61452774436
A bit at a time.	7352.63749313142
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	15236.239894114711
Common pin, eh?	17932.61452774436
He threw it on the road.	7021.507491680018
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	11391.425232853058
Queer the number of pins they always have.	14340.17402726421
No roses without thorns.	8559.348879233634
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	16682.90235283324
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	14263.390940228262
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	6732.559130999664
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	8118.036901432002
It?	4069.623800987504
Them.	16997.075953601572
Such a bad headache.	12817.985451740484
Has her roses probably.	12681.168245145993
Or sitting all day typing.	10855.353746210929
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	17724.87334026543
What perfume does your wife use.	5048.844942388071
Now could you make out a thing like that?	12525.781542984392
To keep it up.	3970.2750061523493
Martha, Mary.	11501.432152066216
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	10800.689884586998
He is sitting in their house, talking.	7304.787146274224
Mysterious.	16997.075953601572
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	12508.342118684832
To keep it up.	3970.2750061523493
Nice kind of evening feeling.	12757.329483635987
No more wandering about.	6946.62202259447
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	13307.89471338913
Forget.	14336.178182593083
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	13896.131880342957
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	13215.89142245435
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	13394.673818998896
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	9790.521649498627
Tell her: more and more: all.	12742.684117601208
Then a sigh: silence.	8857.516807152319
Long long long rest.	12966.423775746363
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	15921.872070036656
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	12520.095116987566
Henry Flower.	11589.25711997126
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	11954.574496004112
Simple bit of paper.	17932.61452774436
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	14351.464636761288
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	16644.041190546446
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	12693.773741263492
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	16727.42622563514
A million pounds, wait a moment.	9507.376927886024
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	16854.774612464058
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	11117.067867087277
Yes, exactly.	4223.907218550617
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	15024.066288223417
What am I saying barrels?	7693.865305788538
Gallons.	19456.598729469286
About a million barrels all the same.	12379.401887060181
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	13582.52509241669
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	17115.978107251347
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	14334.008242714892
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	8326.6824660533
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	16583.658654726296
Damn it.	10785.263627919488
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	11865.10351057293
Same notice on the door.	13170.326936268264
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	11185.312477558427

Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	17041.351916654137
The protestants are the same.	7475.025159920183
Convert Dr William J.	17932.61452774436
Walsh <URL>. to the true religion.	17451.623842446083
Save China ’ s millions.	14820.693222644375
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	12226.277064312759
Prefer an ounce of opium.	17724.87334026543
Celestials.	19456.598729469286
Rank heresy for them.	17932.61452774436
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	17216.031693751804
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	15551.32576810267
Not like Ecce Homo.	8572.63060502773
Crown of thorns and cross.	17724.87334026543
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	16702.366946211594
Chopsticks?	19456.598729469286
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	16667.347011617076
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	16172.548964935568
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	9484.055912751004
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	9484.074403340821
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	13498.768860954096
Still life.	8087.691034639269
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	14510.031675149708
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	8653.760922898102
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	11940.535003273475
Something going on: some sodality.	12948.96427078159
Pity so empty.	13211.596235347006
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	13787.893868466112
Who is my neighbour?	7515.478904715974
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	17451.623842446083
That woman at midnight mass.	9214.787456660213
Seventh heaven.	18679.07077551165
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	15025.30818920317
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	8872.392851107246
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	10476.118418387927
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	13430.414285620449
Her hat and head sank.	9970.211575772451
Then the next one.	5535.339511240016
Her hat sank at once.	9970.211575772451
Then the next one: a small old woman.	9100.974937436102
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	9820.623899111262
Latin.	19456.598729469286
The next one.	5442.1386306936365
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	12658.267184321834
What?	694.4811020788688
_Corpus: _ body.	16760.897092969924
Corpse.	15443.024084639697
Good idea the Latin.	8361.05353383158
Stupefies them first.	18227.54902377354
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	10936.687399656494
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	17356.98505688499
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	10367.464612123997
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	11027.669992221501
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	11887.373796433734
These pots we have to wear.	15024.123100403687
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	12090.039341651755
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	13280.64995323109
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	14734.847826600893
Look at them.	7236.649014185537
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	11193.323086234595
Lollipop.	19456.598729469286
It does.	5220.369506738754
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	8889.95218305491
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	9630.25724603202
Hokypoky penny a lump.	17932.61452774436
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	13754.766916924013
They do.	5908.339131105127
I ’ m sure of that.	3177.6586378906845
Not so lonely.	7517.836418277717
In our confraternity.	7548.570859917291
Then come out a bit spreeish.	10442.415989240184
Let off steam.	9870.706736569753
Thing is if you really believe in it.	16194.737672074629
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	17041.351916654137
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	12244.316053539786
Hence those snores.	15868.195079096857
Blind faith.	15707.401234162882
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	13851.782027689884
Lulls all pain.	18227.54902377354
Wake this time next year.	16053.975985553223
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	13210.429691035357
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	12178.23223415344
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	6892.552481322425
Bald spot behind.	12962.219829989945
Letters on his back: <URL>	16727.42622563514
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	9076.111842405884
And the other one?	3722.6502458992486
Iron nails ran in.	15976.304393411037
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	14346.591263270959
Do not deny my request.	11071.386203001699
Dusk and the light behind her.	17570.648302713715
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	13465.831473618382
Their character.	9746.617166046197
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	13932.751623573868
This very church.	8633.536185438385
Peter Carey, yes.	14932.487582743664
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	8319.195785027396
Denis Carey.	13656.980144780464
And just imagine that.	6614.255028556113
Wife and six children at home.	14775.430373562524
And plotting that murder all the time.	8202.318564902596
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	14335.461821490679
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	9625.418306595659
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	10685.017240308494
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	10053.446671967691
Yes: under the bridge.	8705.390708361378
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	10728.948548658043
Wine.	10940.661888558341
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	16290.057746724517
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	14013.094587176518
Cold comfort.	13656.980144780464
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	16258.895691525848
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	13840.059309081189
Quite right.	6579.296739884995
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	6781.9292734217015
Not going to be any music.	9953.976098046645
Pity.	7168.595020610842
Who has the organ here I wonder?	10343.966488132794
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	14674.903753054616
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	14430.534974189159
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	11865.448652967414
Christ or Pilate?	14632.365267767023
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	15824.366201345296
Music they wanted.	13492.86464334258
Footdrill stopped.	18679.07077551165
Could hear a pin drop.	12544.251882502062
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	8982.029947579078
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	12872.571755363644
Mercadante: seven last words.	17724.87334026543
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	17279.93518182534
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	14829.132272596245
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	10958.645520561839
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	17162.064257603583
Benedictine.	19456.598729469286
Green Chartreuse.	12825.524320071201
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	12426.707820891059
What kind of voice is it?	9368.575798655642
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	10412.387659160491
Connoisseurs.	19456.598729469286
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	14013.8464523487
Kind of a placid.	11129.931737140168
No worry.	6159.577739645505
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	14341.648288308252
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	17570.648302713715
Who knows?	5202.927699997349
One way out of it.	7811.251231269226
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	11377.531254378066
All crossed themselves and stood up.	10383.476819970887
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	10070.494605182841
Stand up at the gospel of course.	14766.037733604171
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	13176.721898667905
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	12591.080571690118
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	12983.527668116962
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	7732.3801665244955
English.	19456.598729469286
Throw them the bone.	15976.304393411037
I remember slightly.	4336.985769610065
How long since your last mass?	9884.433285732286
Glorious and immaculate virgin.	15976.304393411037
Joseph, her spouse.	14932.412306617945
Peter and Paul.	14632.365267767023
More interesting if you understood what it was all about.	14404.453982122528
Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	14960.601221885086
Confession.	19456.598729469286
Everyone wants to.	14188.216383417554
Then I will tell you all.	5412.687692652475
Penance.	16997.075953601572
Punish me, please.	17932.61452774436
Great weapon in their hands.	13493.54887677821
More than doctor or solicitor.	13056.812122290823
Woman dying to.	13211.596235347006
And I schschschschschsch.	5507.228074385988
And did you chachachachacha?	7424.17538465336
And why did you?	6939.079598784372
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	16053.975985553223
Husband learn to his surprise.	16053.975985553223
God ’ s little joke.	9743.476807670513
Then out she comes.	8374.936671717349
Repentance skindeep.	18679.07077551165
Lovely shame.	12492.20319340747

Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.	17570.648302713715
How I found the Lord.	10140.440047124792
Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show.	17076.136894926323
And don ’ t they rake in the money too?	10009.604613286743
Bequests also: to the <URL>. for the time being in his absolute discretion.	16218.441590370405
Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.	17041.448574373208
Monasteries and convents.	18227.54902377354
No browbeating him.	7503.861566893145
He had his answer pat for everything.	7149.994608173352
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	11680.312421563716
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	10991.204565511154
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	15677.30602084275
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	8961.15907786967
All over.	6523.269050754646
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	8254.458994756533
Brother Buzz.	18679.07077551165
Come around with the plate perhaps.	11812.36539146831
Pay your Easter duty.	15665.739701619705
He stood up.	3133.417403164526
Hello.	4249.911687445489
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	13277.553052444402
Women enjoy it.	12182.885842249987
Never tell you.	10227.348794111555
But we.	4950.12028270797
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	14680.091626292298
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	11918.359931239316
Glimpses of the moon.	14932.487582743639
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	14895.786320890029
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	11381.11306123519
Still like you better untidy.	10986.296178364646
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	11693.579666617994
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	11395.760936362247
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	12915.66132913337
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	16609.856668520133
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	16667.49827313516
He covered himself.	5472.076278193412
How goes the time?	9347.516016992688
Quarter past.	16878.573427268955
Time enough yet.	9233.571046342086
Better get that lotion made up.	11680.257910801653
Ah yes, the last time.	9629.90202907899
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	16702.366946211594
Chemists rarely move.	18227.54902377354
Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.	13639.999107178528
Hamilton Long ’ s, founded in the year of the flood.	16627.52191514569
Huguenot churchyard near there.	15976.304393411037
Visit some day.	18227.54902377354
He walked southward along Westland row.	6555.134326060936
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	8732.303545029807
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	7537.244382187895
Bore this funeral affair.	15665.739701619705
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	11736.450554896766
When was it I got it made up last?	12121.03238809785
Wait.	1374.254002664509
I changed a sovereign I remember.	8517.708211314763
First of the month it must have been or the second.	14271.992923324351
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	8836.881734721906
The chemist turned back page after page.	8916.453222764361
Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have.	17451.623842446083

Why?	1363.914055113649
Reaction.	19456.598729469286
A lifetime in a night.	8117.899790053171
Gradually changes your character.	17932.61452774436
Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.	15950.473344786498
All his alabaster lilypots.	8311.969521134488

Doctor Whack.	14855.255256694101
He ought to physic himself a bit.	7667.010435706823
Electuary or emulsion.	18227.54902377354
The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck.	11175.32529063987
Simples.	19456.598729469286
Want to be careful.	7870.922962088746

Clever of nature.	16807.8688531982
— About a fortnight ago, sir?	8239.274872544624
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	896.7288464238603
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	12908.313828220653
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	14777.984022094386
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	10930.558991661075
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	11593.496615457647
— And white wax also, he said.	4411.5051130285865
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	15762.484269390725
Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs.	15426.828426571643

Nice smell these soaps have.	12757.329483635987
Pure curd soap.	15175.67984183378
Time to get a bath round the corner.	11648.474761110228
Hammam.	19456.598729469286
Turkish.	12971.327416137423
Massage.	19456.598729469286
Dirt gets rolled up in your navel.	17451.623842446083
Nicer if a nice girl did it.	17451.623842446083
Also I think I.	12218.456590167541
Yes I.	7083.231180444132
Do it in the bath.	8930.9017416287
Curious longing I.	13814.400447318581
Water to water.	15868.195079096857
Combine business with pleasure.	16760.897092969924
Pity no time for massage.	14084.625240398014
Feel fresh then all the day.	14045.438414267495
Funeral be rather glum.	15976.304393411037
That was two and nine.	6461.864553992102
Have you brought a bottle?	8489.194489749625
— No, Mr Bloom said.	1270.5909884432983
Make it up, please.	13566.671310138481
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	8497.039119926498
— Fourpence, sir.	5817.3251072490575
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	7119.21565911774
Sweet lemony wax.	14188.216383417554
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	2930.612243582315
That makes three and a penny.	9423.070276032235
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	2994.3021789389563
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	10930.397389587773
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	2605.5102115478276
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	11294.041433314502
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	13018.638495223417
What ’ s the best news?	3395.9782684587267
Is that today ’ s?	8494.714024034409
Show us a minute.	13303.468192195103
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	17076.136894926323
He does look balmy.	5861.330577699862
Younger than I am.	17932.61452774436
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	15055.317970916025
Wants a wash too.	14932.487582743664
Take off the rough dirt.	12322.05485053853
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	11938.606507494847
Dandruff on his shoulders.	17932.61452774436
Scalp wants oiling.	18227.54902377354
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	9064.630207592621
Where the bugger is it?	9089.605179374583
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	11433.984092194223
Barber ’ s itch.	17932.61452774436
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	15313.485572694599
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	13563.805904735922
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	3559.8457966540495
— Ascot.	3451.237535283804
Gold cup.	9462.66037797254
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	10228.22265764633
Half a mo.	11952.637771794745
Maximum the second.	18227.54902377354
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	4777.077542906519
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	14928.128096932332
— What ’ s that?	1070.5066707719686
his sharp voice said.	17932.61452774436
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	6219.112227725098
I was going to throw it away that moment.	7624.14264413759
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	15421.1598733535
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	2929.8569494022317
Here, thanks.	7529.423693769067
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	8873.31402467306
God speed scut.	9596.155574710463
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	11069.554240791835
Silly lips of that chap.	14084.625240398014
Betting.	16997.075953601572
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	16682.90235283324
Raffle for large tender turkey.	17724.87334026543
Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	12098.292517801228
Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	15950.473344786498
Keeps a hotel now.	16760.897092969924
They never come back.	7416.797554973043
Fleshpots of Egypt.	18227.54902377354
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	8435.66695453462
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	15287.147279491232
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	12770.329111933663
Damn bad ad.	12738.676159755245
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	12284.129811374001
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	12200.17810275356
Something to catch the eye.	11326.448326956826
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	8263.53560315876
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	14483.508642502247
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	5857.71287891597
How do you do, sir?	5611.022595410309
Heavenly weather really.	18227.54902377354
If life was always like that.	11118.069362326412
Cricket weather.	18679.07077551165
Sit around under sunshades.	14553.805056755707
Over after over.	13492.86464334258
Out.	5690.29118711202
They can ’ t play it here.	8852.975179791583
Duck for six wickets.	17932.61452774436
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	14219.201642083439
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	17570.648302713715
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	9796.67120497023
Heatwave.	19456.598729469286
Won ’ t last.	10091.451832654237
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	14017.984845314853
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	16959.24882930963
This is my body.	8258.169262044787
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	13659.97584851725
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	14474.641814603085
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	10813.03930630391
— Come on, Simon.	2990.1455180008684
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	3346.515527827155
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	10275.945633600328
— Are we all here now?	5494.587264892258
Martin Cunningham asked.	4680.428292695058
Come along, Bloom.	9408.96331545483
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	7974.302743653984
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	11047.406437244575
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	12174.795795291433
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	12183.768270527717
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	16682.90235283324
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	17356.98505688499
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	14625.446973021693
Job seems to suit them.	17724.87334026543
Huggermugger in corners.	18227.54902377354
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	16644.083149168233
Then getting it ready.	8960.410066068014
Laying it out.	18227.54902377354
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	11381.908860935648
Pull it more to your side.	15669.322221546165
Our windingsheet.	9416.023915768359
Never know who will touch you dead.	10711.218005233226
Wash and shampoo.	18227.54902377354
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	9107.213358169514
Keep a bit in an envelope.	12243.57588032034
Grows all the same after.	17724.87334026543
Unclean job.	18679.07077551165
All waited.	4812.862074171159
Nothing was said.	12536.44797527997
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	17724.87334026543
I am sitting on something hard.	5805.441354646574
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	10477.488500568856
Better shift it out of that.	11267.780413436662
Wait for an opportunity.	9905.682833206823
All waited.	4812.862074171159
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	13622.420346125928
A jolt.	4762.787687825449
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	13639.999107178528
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	14301.750232150835
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	11869.292484251426
At walking pace.	9363.504959995214
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	13454.554629787517
Tritonville road.	18679.07077551165
Quicker.	16997.075953601572
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	12338.421226245811
— What way is he taking us?	5597.4965049427965
Mr Power asked through both windows.	7213.033094505725
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	4249.2337550978555
Ringsend.	16997.075953601572
Brunswick street.	18679.07077551165
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	6564.966628145162
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	3657.6922230744176
I am glad to see it has not died out.	8228.050140750089
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	12672.48334329866
Respect.	16997.075953601572
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	10187.175127497141
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	10838.457826028736
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	5887.577724656341
— Who is that?	3282.6978113781906
— Your son and heir.	5924.69058552277
— Where is he?	3036.1259819062225
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	6236.1627085179425
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	13583.708905635986
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	10684.11822957269
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	6031.490719846113
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	13460.258689137325
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	6781.9292734217015
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	17356.98505688499
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	13351.259937746463
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	13509.41879948876
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	10578.561804609662
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	16113.811123028292
Out on the rampage all night.	12525.860583194823
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	17041.351916654137
Wife ironing his back.	14233.55612654143
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	14340.043911698533
All breadcrumbs they are.	8893.041020542014
About six hundred per cent profit.	14198.982637419229
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	6573.134025647618
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	12066.846149095658
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	14788.177911996103
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	5572.171515046484
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	12887.576381981144
A counterjumper ’ s son.	6787.800402908003
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	16305.071706695358
Not likely.	7341.9588068610365
He ceased.	4150.831484335753
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	12098.947403070331
Noisy selfwilled man.	18227.54902377354
Full of his son.	12434.344638328856
He is right.	3228.4556662858818
Something to hand on.	10635.044757819258
If little Rudy had lived.	10505.837416293984
See him grow up.	10175.179690961513
Hear his voice in the house.	14894.997898413952
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	14960.651508268054
My son.	6894.293795334063
Me in his eyes.	10954.750137201388
Strange feeling it would be.	14675.272723149948
From me.	8275.153022040167
Just a chance.	7446.596043164277
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	14307.193035766124
And the sergeant grinning up.	5388.748765678433
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	10428.679059253627
Give us a touch, Poldy.	9518.243435739374
God, I ’ m dying for it.	9334.588988314395
How life begins.	8340.486826694168
Got big then.	11000.354645583897
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	12309.070735345242
My son inside her.	9227.129711445195
I could have helped him on in life.	7469.780745795928
I could.	2698.9206119339547
Make him independent.	12536.44797527997
Learn German too.	15175.67984183378
— Are we late?	3806.331995392796
Mr Power asked.	4385.877497552825
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	9031.084998759397
Molly.	6399.427872187878
Milly.	7586.596070254145
Same thing watered down.	11852.580428062383
Her tomboy oaths.	8833.109756411148
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	13543.838403926497
Soon be a woman.	14932.412306617918
Mullingar.	9728.691757493107
Dearest Papli.	15251.62811167228
Young student.	6956.706697141707
Yes, yes: a woman too.	7404.360662362606
Life, life.	11952.637771794745
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	9456.282969660553
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	8931.24905950726
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	8782.697162675166
Do you follow me?	4549.803096407993
He closed his left eye.	6683.567164737771
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	11619.137097568655
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	6212.102875821747
Crumbs?	16997.075953601572
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	9202.178895179213
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	12967.659192026387
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	11249.501994674734
What do you think, Martin?	5616.177086346661
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	4797.530346439806
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	6067.291702025524
Glad I took that bath.	13169.98556806668
Feel my feet quite clean.	12950.407217399284
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	10245.433861763446
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	4825.8067769209565
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	9438.689202628626
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	5977.25067881568
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	9558.489449844417
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	1846.5511719316864
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	5368.391256554817
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	4240.951833404515
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	5354.07865459032
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	4968.543754349975
He said he ’ d try to come.	7429.618133865237
The carriage halted short.	4929.512522098421
— What ’ s wrong?	2098.7077595042465
— We ’ re stopped.	3835.469073889176
— Where are we?	4092.6339719995626
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	7216.476904910987
— The grand canal, he said.	3722.610446585023
Whooping cough they say it cures.	17570.648302713715
Good job Milly never got it.	10724.392586342592
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	13802.347001285245
Shame really.	15707.401234162882

Dogs ’ home over there.	14675.272723149948
Thy will be done.	16760.897092969924
We obey them in the grave.	10221.055056557272
A dying scrawl.	6108.478345590255
He took it to heart, pined away.	7886.954534622973
Quiet brute.	16878.573427268955
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	12659.330207206498
A raindrop spat on his hat.	8136.081647834798
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	11092.352114611347
Apart.	19456.598729469286
Curious.	12257.630687766508
Like through a colander.	10489.593069935356
I thought it would.	5861.92346583866
My boots were creaking I remember now.	11722.369886228631
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	6577.992668661273
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	6717.629317330929
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	6751.628175242772
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	6445.2992138360405
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	11249.420973357503
— We ’ re off again.	4603.824000689549
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	9841.059940155106
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	7211.940215053305
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	10681.580862162944
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	7264.529857912052
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	12884.38061445138
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	8240.050031507988
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	16570.361059237868
And the retrospective arrangement.	4470.600631067354
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	6954.179180209881
Martin Cunningham asked.	4680.428292695058
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	3808.165885366341
Where is it?	5824.611220706501
— In the paper this morning.	5508.10092395239
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	7974.324673913088
That book I must change for her.	10030.131763405627
Later on please.	18227.54902377354
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	12527.252339694043
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	16635.086093072554
no, Sexton, Urbright.	17724.87334026543
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	17279.93518182534
Thanks to the Little Flower.	13423.858556473508
Sadly missed.	15707.401234162882
To the inexpressible grief of his.	9533.489355617246
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	17356.98505688499
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	17570.71474456905
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	11777.815922006897
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	13553.464836941823
I tore up the envelope?	7748.087875888077
Yes.	992.2748593504894
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	11480.397522137262
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	6579.054785218161
There all right.	7616.422284436096
Dear Henry fled.	11233.731628399419
Before my patience are exhausted.	12734.21474022955

Only two there now.	11772.687689473321
Nodding.	19456.598729469286
Full as a tick.	13956.939215319308
Too much bone in their skulls.	10566.817273193074
The other trotting round with a fare.	7544.373567563198
An hour ago I was passing there.	12179.377121894116
The jarvies raised their hats.	7475.025159920183
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	12791.4042381527
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	12602.795060504852
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	12323.947277677036
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	13327.29336630342
Antient concert rooms.	18227.54902377354
Nothing on there.	12536.44797527997
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	9090.620700903077
Not much grief there.	8572.63060502773
Quarter mourning.	16878.573427268955
People in law perhaps.	13956.939215319308
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	13611.396678135578
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	15551.278730605616
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	13738.546043154383
I said I.	5276.775370149495

_Fun on the Bristol_.	17932.61452774436
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	10898.011273254064
Have to stand a drink or two.	11834.7809587771
As broad as it ’ s long.	11961.861593404912
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	4181.346213331258
Her songs.	7552.434326675674
Plasto ’ s.	18227.54902377354
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	14636.969138328212
Who was he?	7109.89476367519
— How do you do?	2490.8150316331166
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	11160.757607358433
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	5750.279839113867
Yes, he does.	4723.871467733214
How do you do?	3259.33534521692
— Who?	710.3041491697493
Mr Dedalus asked.	2052.187388741324
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	5533.576234407193
There he is airing his quiff.	7025.877710997477
Just that moment I was thinking.	10950.360508069567
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	6906.249881448967
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	13319.757333488637
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	10587.35584553085
The nails, yes.	6549.046155587141
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	12818.275555274158
Fascination.	19456.598729469286
Worst man in Dublin.	15976.304393411037
That keeps him alive.	8359.805223348141
They sometimes feel what a person is.	10463.152996270252
Instinct.	12971.327416137423
But a type like that.	7831.871660991399
My nails.	7629.7325899688285
I am just looking at them: well pared.	7722.50931753697
And after: thinking alone.	7538.776114475032
Body getting a bit softy.	16053.975985553223
I would notice that: from remembering.	8281.332026912083
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	11151.375734193422
But the shape is there.	6643.1694808819175
The shape is there still.	7475.025159920183
Shoulders.	19456.598729469286
Hips.	19456.598729469286
Plump.	19456.598729469286
Night of the dance dressing.	14084.625240398014
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	17570.648302713715
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	12537.278225907834
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	10918.67491019823
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	3147.4058834509933
I hear great accounts of it.	7058.01681891458
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	5597.4034289334595
— Are you going yourself?	3378.88951017825
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	3071.195165875409
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	13447.877393606348
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	10730.909673827387
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	10872.714369148393
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	4078.6505193691546
Mary Anderson is up there now.	15669.322221546165
Have you good artists?	7596.977614869599
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	5991.163343442206
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	9581.598277674479
J.	363.7765778926278
C.	1161.2080535937555
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	16682.90235283324
The best, in fact.	5753.4292136763
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	6378.4147935023375
Last but not least.	12966.423775746363
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	10014.000062466437
Smith O ’ Brien.	16760.981599493316
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	15313.531897952069
Woman.	7168.595020610842
Must be his deathday.	6559.645254394819
For many happy returns.	9700.725359187118
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	16937.421557610043
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	7179.394409205818
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	12484.86566215013
Had his office in Hume street.	12948.96427078159
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	14964.8515936507
Has that silk hat ever since.	13549.539159002346
Relics of old decency.	17932.61452774436
Mourning too.	16878.573427268955
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	15219.020934043794
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	7264.394114475182
Twenty past eleven.	14188.216383417554
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	14636.924859753652
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	14994.26741607638
No: _vorrei e non_.	8249.420469104025
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	14598.982954696734
_Mi trema un poco il_.	17724.87334026543
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	16644.041190546446
A thrush.	3513.98049838411
A throstle.	3513.98049838411
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	9552.106774798474
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	10448.792344269556
Greyish over the ears.	17932.61452774436
_Madame_: smiling.	18227.54902377354
I smiled back.	5276.775370149495
A smile goes a long way.	8872.392851107246
Only politeness perhaps.	11000.354645583897
Nice fellow.	10505.443060228716
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	12029.389342309747
Not pleasant for the wife.	9810.476024971998
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	14590.438785857583
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	10895.16675534972
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	9791.226444295593
What is this she was?	5486.8929496866385
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	17724.87334026543
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	10461.433518433845
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	8589.961621251874
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	5536.305156565609
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	13669.965941108981
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	6361.664424316877
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	14103.120294857988
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	8551.403631681884
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	8744.275777441659
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	11700.420417687936
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	9685.010044686069
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	8426.061313808452
— Yes.	607.5585411172303
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	8162.600034133252
— What is that?	2184.4465388205394
Mr Dedalus asked.	2052.187388741324
I didn ’ t hear it.	4576.921085110063
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	10977.76448011643
— What?	681.7536505896779
Mr Dedalus asked.	2052.187388741324
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	9912.933555173273
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	9648.733599135665
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	8239.274872544624
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	12238.635920076928
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	4315.981554950255
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	14683.739155701009
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	9568.983494582162
Is he dead?	7380.775788369923
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	6824.613287354657
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	15064.164966358225
Half the town was there.	13112.33131626797
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	896.7288464238603
But the funny part is.....	5949.876707752365
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	10233.983655443577
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	10504.063240722771
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	5387.230714939796
Like a hero.	7455.312224734144
A silver florin.	6108.478345590255
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	5461.318130279923
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	3870.369652515145
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	8742.77061815319
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	9833.068920279668
Nelson ’ s pillar.	14233.556143906346
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	10701.625074638785
Mr Dedalus sighed.	3772.5921256618417
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	11048.59300628343
Many a good one he told himself.	14515.329583120745
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	9695.478782069977
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	15395.326407183382
He ’ s gone from us.	3010.9449247178873
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	7933.240008091786
He went very suddenly.	4757.076122782233
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	4249.2337550978555
Heart.	9780.093555557632
He tapped his chest sadly.	6683.538281061451
Blazing face: redhot.	17932.61452774436
Too much John Barleycorn.	9103.019964241348
Cure for a red nose.	16727.42622563514
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	14933.521581501345
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	9265.333309951548
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	10074.782859228075
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	5813.653346872727
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	3458.8817428207553
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	13070.123269663876
— No suffering, he said.	3425.663516705731
A moment and all is over.	8872.392851107246
Like dying in sleep.	10489.593069935356
No - one spoke.	4849.45098901498
Dead side of the street this.	14369.103464748194
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	16426.29359661347
Why?	1363.914055113649
Some reason.	10640.944770708618
Sun or wind.	16807.8688531982
At night too.	8634.21424178339
Chummies and slaveys.	18227.54902377354
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	12897.054436358101
Foundation stone for Parnell.	17932.61452774436
Breakdown.	19456.598729469286
Heart.	9780.093555557632
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	15568.88640064323
A tiny coffin flashed by.	7661.07419999088
In a hurry to bury.	7081.492946373052
A mourning coach.	6108.478345590255
Unmarried.	19456.598729469286
Black for the married.	13956.939215319308
Piebald for bachelors.	18227.54902377354
Dun for a nun.	17932.61452774436
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	3896.5940025860455
A child.	4005.071671117754
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	12042.64190767458
Dwarf ’ s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	17041.351916654137
Burial friendly society pays.	17932.61452774436
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	15551.32576810267

Baby.	19456.598729469286
Meant nothing.	18679.07077551165
Mistake of nature.	15868.195079096857
If it ’ s healthy it ’ s from the mother.	12552.007722067317
If not from the man.	9515.467803437881
Better luck next time.	11131.22160100128
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	5234.824191241118
It ’ s well out of it.	3959.668526730884
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	9026.349370883152
Rattle his bones.	12151.993435885855
Over the stones.	9755.264275874933
Only a pauper.	9158.546770620618
Nobody owns.	10471.917594461911
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	5414.410165502665
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	10781.25117184405
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	12178.1639980099
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	8185.691168373897
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	10208.299694120695
We must take a charitable view of it.	10933.21989726108
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	7410.433293513805
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	5664.139133040986
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	7680.577130866108
Looking away now.	12352.082759196523
Sympathetic human man he is.	15786.109314441857
Intelligent.	19456.598729469286
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	9820.379266624028
Always a good word to say.	13261.731982296742
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	9917.152617006828
Refuse christian burial.	18227.54902377354
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	11426.18455207328
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	13549.539159002346
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	16702.366946211594
He looked at me.	3627.3015737364453
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	9416.94365050535
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	16937.421557610043
Leading him the life of the damned.	16682.902352833207
Monday morning.	16878.573427268955
Start afresh.	18679.07077551165
Shoulder to the wheel.	16760.897092969924
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	14485.820600603689
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	17162.064257603583
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	9753.969836032347
He looked away from me.	5440.9103796814325
He knows.	2850.0663009778227
Rattle his bones.	12151.993435885855
That afternoon of the inquest.	9214.787456660213
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	7569.429517727258
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	9484.074403340821
Stuffy it was.	18227.54902377354
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	17356.98505688499
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	10403.972071259352
Boots giving evidence.	18227.54902377354
Thought he was asleep first.	14820.693222644375
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	10680.357613018023
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	10642.438386327784
Verdict: overdose.	18227.54902377354
Death by misadventure.	14632.365267767023
The letter.	3725.095356282331
For my son Leopold.	8642.450934049562
No more pain.	5840.96147449283
Wake no more.	15868.195079096857
Nobody owns.	10471.917594461911
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	7378.069652060725
Over the stones.	9755.264275874933
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	6686.721520928232
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	3363.1641100804545
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	10312.916752332987
The Gordon Bennett.	5442.1386306936365
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	3223.940258014517
That will be worth seeing, faith.	9286.707789358004
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	14309.595358785882
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	11069.665660522485
Kay ee double ell wy.	14059.409198789604
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	14398.944559952593
He left me on my ownio.	7873.501926046016
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	17724.87334026543
Eccles street.	18679.07077551165
My house down there.	9872.178046021547
Big place.	11107.817728783746
Ward for incurables there.	15976.304393411037
Deadhouse handy underneath.	18227.54902377354
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	10360.672876510846
They look terrible the women.	9181.88388318125
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	12730.413840836669
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	10481.87808205033
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	14106.297198456048
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	6877.9259608813045
From one extreme to the other.	11694.944597914095
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	7997.799384573849
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	13921.563639447637
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	15771.461168324415
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	4826.186457100042
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	11669.584089621861
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	15509.561650686413
Tomorrow is killing day.	16760.897092969924
Springers.	19456.598729469286
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	17451.623842446083
For Liverpool probably.	8720.090461897724
Roastbeef for old England.	17932.61452774436
They buy up all the juicy ones.	10002.26462107063
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	10896.949841369764
Comes to a big thing in a year.	17356.98505688499
Dead meat trade.	13211.596235347006
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	17215.988293285944
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	13045.285691587325
The carriage moved on through the drove.	7378.069652060725
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	8969.490505849546
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	11587.89143531964
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	7164.715695879067
Quite right.	6579.296739884995
They ought to.	5500.661308415087
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	16032.227303004362
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	7534.7046951045495
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	5125.221179986011
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	17724.87334026543
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	7356.025929976259
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	6061.019172998855
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	11580.968735531837
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	7611.006013058396
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	11266.437749789704
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	10380.023747637368
Gordon Bennett cup.	15498.762615744456
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	9805.546867595524
Bom! Upset.	18227.54902377354
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	9265.333309951531
Burst open.	16878.573427268955
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	15837.09345903805
Red face: grey now.	14540.717283816273
Mouth fallen open.	14632.365267767023
Asking what ’ s up now.	16702.366946211594
Quite right to close it.	11902.285428495838
Looks horrid open.	13211.596235347006
Then the insides decompose quickly.	7571.236601712599
Much better to close up all the orifices.	16667.347011617076
Yes, also.	4223.907218550617
With wax.	7431.836760265275
The sphincter loose.	5442.1386306936365
Seal up all.	16807.8688531982
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	10884.848596146352
Dunphy ’ s corner.	15976.304393411037
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	16667.347011617076
A pause by the wayside.	8117.899790053171
Tiptop position for a pub.	16727.42622563514
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	16331.141710601602
Pass round the consolation.	15976.304393411037
But suppose now it did happen.	9376.348222025134
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	14304.885921505032
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	8276.785659311547
Depends on where.	15498.762615744456
The circulation stops.	5442.1386306936365
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	12418.295883399669
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	11217.455388696764
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	10693.844815858989
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	13761.417427023754
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	16702.366946211594
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	16112.477388603033
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	10191.99368402168
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	9608.700717905689
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	17356.98505688499
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	13867.913602387474
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	16937.421557610043
Or cycle down.	9175.155872417936
Hire some old crock, safety.	16702.366946211594
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	16615.080386735448
Developing waterways.	18679.07077551165
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	15570.655045960348
Cheaper transit.	18679.07077551165
By easy stages.	9007.53051680912
Houseboats.	19456.598729469286
Camping out.	18679.07077551165
Also hearses.	10505.443060228716
To heaven by water.	9530.31373028954
Perhaps I will without writing.	12544.251882502062
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	12633.205445662465
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	17451.623842446083
With turf from the midland bogs.	11083.02296188474
Salute.	19456.598729469286
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	8463.009799606658
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	10002.26462107063
Near it now.	12352.082759196523
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	6678.851248314038
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	5456.707694875709
— How is that?	3224.576545691954
Martin Cunningham said.	3171.8546015714915
Left him weeping, I suppose?	15316.253852478569
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	9608.842312263825
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	7378.069652060725
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	8849.007850220909
Last lap.	10377.688596154409
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	16842.048511082874
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	17724.87334026543
In white silence: appealing.	9442.982486109322
The best obtainable.	4530.9522090197315
Thos.	19456.598729469286
H.	4950.086631348197
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	17570.648302713715
Passed.	19456.598729469286
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	13794.379076425957
After life ’ s journey.	11640.498666751826
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	17115.978107251347
Mr Power pointed.	5037.989305048247
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	5306.777906402044
The last house.	4236.128531605051
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	4690.255959831107
A gruesome case.	6108.478345590255
Seymour Bushe got him off.	17724.87334026543
Murdered his brother.	18227.54902377354
Or so they said.	8841.41724193621
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	5450.648184402611
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	7197.742152081793
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	4377.612177490685
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	14036.884212148438
They looked.	5338.8274532533715
Murderer ’ s ground.	11395.735728287644
It passed darkly.	6573.626976382823
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	17570.648302713715
Whole place gone to hell.	16053.975985553223
Wrongfully condemned.	18679.07077551165
Murder.	16997.075953601572
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	10781.131976508643
They love reading about it.	9181.88388318125
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	15208.151067088516
Her clothing consisted of.	9805.387013490194
Recent outrage.	18679.07077551165
Murderer is still at large.	16053.975985553223
Clues.	19456.598729469286
A shoelace.	4762.787687825449
The body to be exhumed.	7054.376609466871
Murder will out.	16807.8688531982
Cramped in this carriage.	17932.61452774436
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	12627.150807338534
Must be careful about women.	7485.39343669067
Catch them once with their pants down.	16158.125825015217
Never forgive you after.	11079.13719112889
Fifteen.	9780.093555557632
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	9614.294651306222
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	15316.311760780676
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	16830.330222355613
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	9484.074403340821
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	12935.322882877186
He stepped out.	4392.742787641179
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	7865.808878592516
Change that soap now.	15976.304393411037
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	10563.087935217689
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	11193.351665216167
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	17451.623842446083
It ’ s all the same.	2979.1669035632385
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	17162.064257603583
Pomp of death.	18227.54902377354
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	16318.916210301157
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	17115.978107251347
Dogbiscuits.	19456.598729469286
Who ate them?	8166.976190181595
Mourners coming out.	16807.8688531982
He followed his companions.	5747.391691739402
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	10613.578017773476
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	12889.872976837714
He handed one to the boy.	7873.501926046016
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	9915.744108733788
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	13836.496883914851
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	8916.453222764361
Coffin now.	18679.07077551165
Got here before us, dead as he is.	13735.689917855618
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	16654.630702959552
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	16331.141710601602
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	12348.803752606427
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	9493.280946674184
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	10442.415989240184
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	17357.09006966636
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	17451.623842446083
Too many in the world.	9215.131621219925
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	16635.086093072554
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	17116.052075911473
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	15550.170181498499
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	10797.904268943506
So much dead weight.	9185.182546630816
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	16194.737672074629
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	14098.442103493428
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	11775.65352841687
Who is that beside them?	8411.074242562641
Ah, the brother - in - law.	6690.771784420428
All walked after.	7856.268068370497
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	12986.90638571837
— What?	681.7536505896779
Mr Power whispered.	4645.597903076478
How so?	7029.657647677527
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	9012.623301232685
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	12686.396580101271
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	11401.461304503975
Anniversary.	19456.598729469286
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	5533.947761363389
First I heard of it.	11040.972820237253
Poisoned himself?	18679.07077551165
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	12161.057422144635
Speaking.	15443.024084639697
— Was he insured?	4206.190992500233
Mr Bloom asked.	1384.4535954744215
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	5548.625785882725
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	7444.850031952269
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	13551.788938650963
— How many children did he leave?	6004.821283275868
— Five.	3451.237535283804
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	7358.130819077419
Five young children.	12352.082759196523
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	8750.292326307566
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	7876.371930716473
Has the laugh at him now.	12425.07615906799
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	9086.285354776062
She had outlived him.	5643.839219875487
Lost her husband.	15868.195079096857
More dead for her than for me.	13759.066380780712
One must outlive the other.	10691.049044173882
Wise men say.	15868.195079096857
There are more women than men in the world.	8989.286840949744
Condole with her.	18227.54902377354
Your terrible loss.	10678.877177672812
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	7040.192401650456
For Hindu widows only.	9700.725359187118
She would marry another.	6399.038964358723
Him?	15443.024084639697
No. Yet who knows after.	7031.247214851891
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	17279.93518182534
Drawn on a guncarriage.	17932.61452774436
Victoria and Albert.	18227.54902377354
Frogmore memorial mourning.	18227.54902377354
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	11377.37296073832
Vain in her heart of hearts.	16702.366946211594
All for a shadow.	7134.888261010539
Consort not even a king.	17724.87334026543
Her son was the substance.	10564.729742187508
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	14263.390940228262
It never comes.	5722.743913754197
— How are you, Simon?	4780.964609168764
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	10510.558883660082
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	13996.126267725756
— Never better.	3624.333875729715
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	10084.79072890833
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	7745.551913167686
Same old six and eightpence.	12429.181747293862
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	14932.487582743664
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	6460.555332192148
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	8860.378805149889
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	9295.84335598643
Dick Tivy bald?	16807.8688531982
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	12030.157823215995
A few bob a skull.	6045.344139159519
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	13116.083990997355
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	4819.31576751012
Is that the eldest boy in front?	9848.880842848075
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	6221.313750972659
John Henry Menton is behind.	8006.152058420622
He put down his name for a quid.	8279.194900427472
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	3613.277653569425
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	10243.416830085233
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	10211.45587247415
— How did he lose it?	5290.967076968747
Ned Lambert asked.	5007.015961106531
Liquor, what?	18227.54902377354
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	10393.479963638196
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	10461.778708118034
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	11550.358412007356
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	13357.381123676254
Both unconscious.	11699.385526317174
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	15824.297820001044
All he might have done.	9716.350077818355
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	9725.28344188899
Would he understand?	10715.503633384258
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	9107.247522908538
Which end is his head?	13423.858556473508
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	13388.832317753773
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	11896.447480558854
Always in front of us.	12851.098087836783
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	13295.71060860845
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	8497.46521921008
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	12096.979182762807
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	12460.448900576182
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	12042.577620706998
Who ’ ll read the book?	8700.03529938646
I, said the rook.	6622.803436902527
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	13006.980448596722
Father Coffey.	8677.212540002572
I knew his name was like a coffin.	9074.065202671134
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	13439.963644518888
Bosses the show.	18227.54902377354
Muscular christian.	18679.07077551165
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	17215.988293285944
Thou art Peter.	13993.699109352883
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	16635.086093072554
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	9619.807351943773
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	14045.438414267495
Hhhn: burst sideways.	17932.61452774436
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	12254.781618934492
Requiem mass.	18679.07077551165
Crape weepers.	18679.07077551165
Blackedged notepaper.	18679.07077551165
Your name on the altarlist.	11417.474848068117
Chilly place this.	18227.54902377354
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	14132.320083509869
Eyes of a toad too.	14540.717283816273
What swells him up that way?	9368.575798655642
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	12357.336220593894
Air of the place maybe.	17724.87334026543
Looks full up of bad gas.	14369.103464748194
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	10789.13135916546
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	16644.041190546446
Who was telling me?	5952.702217721335
Mervyn Browne.	18679.07077551165
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	16181.298791961157
Out it rushes: blue.	12757.329483635987
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	12819.114507843717
My kneecap is hurting me.	10626.382741620842
Ow. That ’ s better.	14894.997898413925
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	12714.102895196205
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	10398.409097755273
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	9769.694639226509
As you were before you rested.	11487.956889918205
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	6659.281849080197
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	11091.765194598125
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	10243.4406667303
Up to fifteen or so.	12584.425674726932
After that, of course...	11499.657894892029
Holy water that was, I expect.	15948.04205195143
Shaking sleep out of it.	13722.6327910196
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	12703.352840358732
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	11371.982773711654
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	15842.425557733144
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	12845.32966187038
On Dignam now.	8981.323278585294
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	10552.44601456186
Says that over everybody.	15976.304393411037
Tiresome kind of a job.	16727.42622563514
But he has to say something.	7495.307406262009
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	10128.293694123935
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	14395.791845495756
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	11529.852936085903
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	12672.510726063314
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	8646.588684370989
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	10580.775114637827
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	13554.02844792014
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	10404.024526894907
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	12353.417592064903
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	8249.860011377548
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	10849.219330501137
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	8447.064054951048
But his heart is buried in Rome.	9985.91332034323
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	11064.156572997674
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	4861.843044781867
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	12412.147851551481
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	16959.275831344166
Mr Power took his arm.	7074.166205207733
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	8049.9441307830075
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	7153.286072312597
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	9879.758752027388
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	13091.70002686485
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	8241.793916730117
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	8920.501509880325
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	7784.986416255431
I suppose we can do so too.	7860.036776134762
We are the last.	4617.760691064832
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	12010.913107149021
They covered their heads.	8324.989829218672
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	7646.867425542141
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	8473.640177850557
Mason, I think: not sure.	17451.623842446083
Beside him again.	13492.701411031798
We are the last.	4617.760691064832
In the same boat.	4944.5368881963705
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	12953.87556522496
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	12916.675996442747
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	5257.990705953329
The language of course was another thing.	8916.453222764361
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	11532.64790395237
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	10980.353607879228
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	3150.586083436485
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	14692.811798072198
No touching that.	7503.861566893145
Seat of the affections.	17932.61452774436
Broken heart.	16878.573427268955
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	11861.08857236919
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	13292.917610596473
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	15372.603979983198
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	11512.463053893054
The resurrection and the life.	7475.025159920183
Once you are dead you are dead.	14440.640581436473
That last day idea.	8359.805223348141
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	17356.98505688499
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	13817.065210970644
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	14798.62601696145
Find damn all of himself that morning.	16158.125825015217
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	17570.648302713715
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	15976.304393411037
Troy measure.	18679.07077551165
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	11383.124622957874
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	6109.680230095968
What?	694.4811020788688
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	7593.398496662011
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	13956.798520374594
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	9700.725359187118
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	7658.056329863629
— What?	681.7536505896779
Corny Kelleher said.	6824.988640799058
Mr Kernan assured him.	6330.581163586602
John Henry Menton asked.	7095.087503275446
I know his face.	3522.1892063215696
Ned Lambert glanced back.	8967.57289980775
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	11360.69345354953
She ’ s his wife.	4598.418847720502
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	5882.687574513722
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	8488.08145494215
She was a finelooking woman.	5911.441808196458
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	12355.107850454679
And a good armful she was.	7754.270526845846
He looked behind through the others.	6251.58533766994
— What is he?	2451.9212496554856
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
What does he do?	6456.243192215237
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	16667.397432479003
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	11605.796373056479
Ned Lambert smiled.	7935.345459467962
A traveller for blottingpaper.	7210.75792986819
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	11531.323945770055
She had plenty of game in her then.	8674.26931056129
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	6237.405188581427
He does some canvassing for ads.	7595.427771470045
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	9784.388578356497
The barrow turned into a side lane.	8523.694974858749
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	12109.620516064902
The gravediggers touched their caps.	6557.9743921465615
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	9255.717024725622
He never forgets a friend.	6796.947932225799
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	9493.003162998659
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	9461.701551964465
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	8699.253091690836
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	4644.119456736544
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	16854.754217365455
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	9737.739535892071
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	3229.5368749823247
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	12319.01687721953
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	12622.068984489151
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	12322.59233208935
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	12780.045590112062
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	13870.622263044825
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	10288.36891523153
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	11613.191845048283
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	10047.421068653177
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	12041.466103074952
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	16290.037924235738
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	16412.314330421166
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	6911.4409952000915
— I know, Hynes said.	2598.4402338993905
I know that.	2803.798387341083
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	6020.237898196683
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	5937.6509033569455
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	7974.302743653984
All want to be on good terms with him.	11786.919011484611
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	14698.303973920683
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	17041.416357021913
No passout checks.	7503.861566893145
_Habeas corpus_.	18679.07077551165
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	8671.838678983893
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	13832.311480692724
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	13118.25326487102
Be the better of a shave.	13351.61319840644
Grey sprouting beard.	15868.195079096857
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	6586.680293088613
And temper getting cross.	7424.17538465336
Silver threads among the grey.	16727.42622563514
Fancy being his wife.	15976.304393411037
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	13532.035304970887
Come out and live in the graveyard.	11074.776369306426
Dangle that before her.	17932.61452774436
It might thrill her first.	9064.908611066421
Courting death.	18679.07077551165
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	17162.064257603583
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	13876.348106697664
Will o ’ the wisp.	12505.304740148655
Gas of graves.	16807.8688531982
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	11998.438948457846
Women especially are so touchy.	13292.258639585922
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	13530.95557541158
Have you ever seen a ghost?	9226.472913030711
Well, I have.	5676.122887638888
It was a pitchdark night.	4555.393977525143
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	9107.247522908538
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	12576.49975168831
Learn anything if taken young.	15550.35106674391
You might pick up a young widow here.	10023.89704080093
Men like that.	14632.365267767023
Love among the tombstones.	11852.99849689722
Romeo.	19456.598729469286
Spice of pleasure.	18227.54902377354
In the midst of death we are in life.	8878.892000007718
Both ends meet.	12536.44797527997
Tantalising for the poor dead.	17724.87334026543
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	15068.167196265733
Gnawing their vitals.	18227.54902377354
Desire to grig people.	16760.897092969924
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	13483.837049675829
Eight children he has anyway.	17724.87334026543
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	11174.18202885368
Holy fields.	16878.573427268955
More room if they buried them standing.	13759.066380780712
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	14115.850054241482
Standing?	16997.075953601572
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	12439.97905082724
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	11728.996069745788
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	10578.561804609662
Well, so it is.	7112.9622228588705
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	10672.50782718993
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	16620.767957823315
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	8916.453222764361
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	6407.842940885893
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	14477.373682950012
Every man his price.	12818.243863230015
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	13692.429046560446
A bargain.	4762.787687825449
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	13717.23180181746
With thanks.	7431.836760265275
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	12036.042749326261
Charnelhouses.	19456.598729469286
Dreadful.	15443.024084639697
Turning green and pink decomposing.	15150.622186653598
Rot quick in damp earth.	17724.87334026543
The lean old ones tougher.	7475.025159920183
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	11486.717099527863
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	12350.638257930681
Then dried up.	7927.740054552596
Deathmoths.	19456.598729469286
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	11294.34452939538
Changing about.	16878.573427268955
Live for ever practically.	15393.126810427384
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	13550.769457555894
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	11211.36820528411
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	17451.623842446083
Your head it simply swurls.	6866.464861158549
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	12505.304740148655
He looks cheerful enough over it.	7873.501926046016
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	16620.767957823315
Wonder how he looks at life.	10919.354273099474
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	16635.086093072554
The one about the bulletin.	6657.399578401511
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	17279.93518182534
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	13370.71809053884
Not arrived yet.	8635.62183246531
Peter.	13490.99621301991
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	12812.842576786015
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	11861.08857236919
Keep out the damp.	12434.783306957284
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	10374.408926199747
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	16807.8688531982
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	16667.347011617076
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	17115.978107251347
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	17724.87334026543
Go out of mourning first.	13056.812122290823
Hard to imagine his funeral.	13493.54887677821
Seems a sort of a joke.	14775.653852631589
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	15188.16286951117
Gives you second wind.	16760.897092969924
New lease of life.	13602.859108471028
— How many have you for tomorrow?	6004.841467006336
the caretaker asked.	11390.435411185195
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	5351.213610216763
Half ten and eleven.	13498.003490640338
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	7896.139878900441
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	7846.551857257705
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	11850.978030395256
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	11959.488305678415
Burying him.	16878.573427268955
We come to bury Cæsar.	10111.88095965841
His ides of March or June.	10004.661937286033
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	8017.6861418272265
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	12670.032693440162
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	11481.658148926253
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	11384.780838247261
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	13858.756305820938
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	10304.263759806086
Yes, he could.	4723.871467733214
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	14026.221506387388
We all do.	8307.619670497574
Only man buries.	11000.354645583897
No, ants too.	5264.074647058816
First thing strikes anybody.	12026.020676764052
Bury the dead.	16807.8688531982
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	13759.066380780712
Well then Friday buried him.	11042.402646115655
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	14822.125361425506
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	9710.025690480876
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	12926.032834730579
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	12783.939948985395
All gnawed through.	7856.268068370497
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	12996.30207881853
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	15090.209505635008
They ’ re so particular.	7067.176074982303
Lay me in my native earth.	15669.322221546165
Bit of clay from the holy land.	14766.037733604171
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	13386.008996273513
I see what it means.	5281.7357075048
I see.	1944.1267170399663
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	12153.66571821671
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	8745.41940796706
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	17356.98505688499
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	9875.654477991566
Twelve.	15443.024084639697
I ’ m thirteen.	2058.5292253760767
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	8167.5661370855905
Death ’ s number.	14932.487582743664
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	10875.459234651558
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	11434.007151694625
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	14084.625240398014
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	14016.981853469384
Tinge of purple.	18227.54902377354
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	9519.945928654888
Dressy fellow he was once.	17724.87334026543
Used to change three suits in the day.	14933.386082196748
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	11139.845676264978
Hello.	4249.911687445489
It ’ s dyed.	2612.450539175188
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	13468.001698692367
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	11681.14058272497
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	11370.092057475593
Twenty.	12815.418782069682
Pause.	19456.598729469286
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	11618.811453040482
Far away a donkey brayed.	12429.020679382458
Rain.	11785.351918411056
No such ass.	7503.861566893145
Never see a dead one, they say.	10022.423721365232
Shame of death.	15868.195079096857
They hide.	5908.339131105127
Also poor papa went away.	12757.329483635987
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	17162.064257603583
Whisper.	9031.408469903961
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	11959.488305678415
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	6917.347430876571
Wellcut frockcoat.	18679.07077551165
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	17215.988293285944
Well, it is a long rest.	8105.403276280022
Feel no more.	12738.676159755245
It ’ s the moment you feel.	3959.681832158083
Must be damned unpleasant.	6559.645254394819
Can ’ t believe it at first.	8448.236580246632
Mistake must be: someone else.	16112.477388603033
Try the house opposite.	13714.062609733974
Wait, I wanted to.	10228.22265764633
I haven ’ t yet.	6512.355739180969
Then darkened deathchamber.	7927.740054552596
Light they want.	13492.86464334258
Whispering around you.	15868.195079096857
Would you like to see a priest?	10522.724080898091
Then rambling and wandering.	8960.410066068014
Delirium all you hid all your life.	17451.623842446083
His sleep is not natural.	9312.301015802657
Press his lower eyelid.	17932.61452774436
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	16605.27055147329
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	16140.704445732485
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	15870.296748191544
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	16682.902352833207
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	16053.975985553223
Bam! He expires.	17932.61452774436
Gone at last.	12962.219829989945
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	15071.8829622338
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	8075.1789912230415
Remember him in your prayers.	12950.686926226486
Even Parnell.	11107.817728783746
Ivy day dying out.	17932.61452774436
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	11795.904793393514
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	8948.281013322478
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	17279.93518182534
Nice change of air.	12218.456590167541
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	12806.327096947784
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	14994.267416076353
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	9203.685530225537
Someone walking over it.	14553.805056755707
Near you.	11484.713480619906
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	15710.001743080335
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	16667.347011617076
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	11537.205575951863
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	5563.773099018002
And if he was alive all the time?	8959.405306143606
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	15386.807348909575
Of course he is dead.	8635.32186137265
Monday he died.	16807.8688531982
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	13917.616097003358
Flag of distress.	18227.54902377354
Three days.	9838.938135192795
Rather long to keep them in summer.	15184.223820049572
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	13656.643984704022
The clay fell softer.	6549.046155587141
Begin to be forgotten.	14387.339559964428
Out of sight, out of mind.	11433.575154905264
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	9908.263777663566
Had enough of it.	11937.313751103518
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	10476.118433610336
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	11124.377524108211
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	15824.297820001044
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	16158.125825015217
Ah, the names.	6151.360327864782
But he knows them all.	6694.650337016173
No: coming to me.	8249.420469104025
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	7478.310997803803
What is your christian name?	6057.942428575815
I ’ m not sure.	2202.792999810989
Leopold.	12257.630687766508
He asked me to.	4611.156539639127
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	7552.619014829941
I know.	1542.5175897738552
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	11943.036515676726
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	10429.430497424715
Find out what they imagine they know.	16158.125825015217
He died of a Tuesday.	6583.722725361223
Got the run.	9576.480810870831
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	17356.98505688499
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	16683.294849495447
That was why he asked me to.	7275.593051967547
O well, does no harm.	9078.057449498943
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	7199.360465486719
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	12138.867266302717
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	16667.347011617076
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	10531.137566881562
He looked around.	3488.607256117426
— Macintosh.	3451.237535283804
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	4530.156452660434
Where is he now?	5041.393911493161
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	8145.338295644266
I don ’ t know who he is.	3658.2372437624495
Is that his name?	7602.740594893719
He moved away, looking about him.	7916.042843610887
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	5103.414699165831
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	8639.621330714175
What?	694.4811020788688
Where has he disappeared to?	10360.672876510846
Not a sign.	6392.481860538492
Well of all the.	10324.541909971475
Has anybody here seen?	10354.28712814099
Kay ee double ell.	13685.422168597364
Become invisible.	18679.07077551165
Good Lord, what became of him?	11106.08635009624
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	11861.08857236919
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	5914.740668227751
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	17076.136894926323
It rose.	5777.244854897311
Nearly over.	16878.573427268955
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	12535.466719037599
All uncovered again for a few instants.	10933.863096708925
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	10884.16278698278
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	11030.25803212769
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	12169.538100189837
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	13292.917610596473
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	13641.446227302724
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	16667.347011617076
His navelcord.	6055.98139396054
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	10989.736311489607
Thanks in silence.	12352.082759196523
Sorry, sir: trouble.	15150.556721689854
Headshake.	19456.598729469286
I know that.	2803.798387341083
For yourselves just.	8720.090461897724
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	12526.561594270315
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	9302.639988083793
— Let us, Mr Power said.	4228.883968789474
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	10599.509344359823
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	14383.160116745787
That the coffin was filled with stones.	9476.755950306666
That one day he will come again.	9476.755950306666
Hynes shook his head.	14233.412627925942
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	6688.223074754491
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	6382.325532033994
Peace to his ashes.	16760.897092969924
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	12804.765154351215
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	14690.234537175456
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	13175.424786620848
Does anybody really?	14188.216383417554
Plant him and have done with him.	17451.741159554967
Like down a coalshoot.	10489.593069935356
Then lump them together to save time.	10989.013111593878
All souls ’ day.	8893.041020542014
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	17357.405073706523
Ten shillings for the gardener.	11876.30273057499
He keeps it free of weeds.	8282.810077087443
Old man himself.	10227.348794111555
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	17451.623842446083
Near death ’ s door.	13423.858556473508
Who passed away.	8856.801548293877
Who departed this life.	9827.298447216312
As if they did it of their own accord.	11911.454375333618
Got the shove, all of them.	12205.262343965986
Who kicked the bucket.	8755.21587299585
So and So, wheelwright.	10584.962188229216
I travelled for cork lino.	7748.087875888077
I paid five shillings in the pound.	8281.332026912083
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	11033.616609304176
I cooked good Irish stew.	7748.087875888077
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	16917.721652030206
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	17451.623842446083
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	11730.65542103653
The great physician called him home.	8254.458994756533
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	13063.078836476825
Nice country residence.	11502.058163606334
Newly plastered and painted.	17932.61452774436
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	16917.697281476372
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	17279.93518182534
Better value that for the money.	12287.462279843841
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	9954.449594733906
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	8159.863554567836
Expresses nothing.	18679.07077551165
Immortelles.	19456.598729469286
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	10512.986157440577
Like stuffed.	8356.565255029953
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	14933.52158150132
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	15509.522558030554
Dead animal even sadder.	13714.062609733974
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	15804.010220057795
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	9484.074403340821
Heart on his sleeve.	14553.805056755707
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	13281.38582256364
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	14933.521581501345
Seems anything but pleased.	14233.55612654143
Why this infliction?	8498.837790383894
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	15585.547392897863
Apollo that was.	18227.54902377354
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	11073.71045030827
Besides how could you remember everybody?	14559.54209314761
Eyes, walk, voice.	13722.454934575693
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	9539.140706568125
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	13611.048803527787
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	14298.161685211302
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	17279.93518182534
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	15447.052773499232
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	15870.520783970498
For instance who?	6608.832675220518
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	10470.900858543127
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	17570.648302713715
Wait.	1374.254002664509
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	14335.789067306314
Some animal.	10640.944770708618
Wait.	1374.254002664509
There he goes.	4830.383571324846
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	14061.314525867238
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	11995.494590463675
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	11921.284113977003
Good hidingplace for treasure.	10421.353401935503
Who lives there?	8856.801548293877
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	13370.71809053884
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	14507.559498795008
Making his rounds.	14632.276751995785
Tail gone now.	18227.54902377354
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	10288.36891523153
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	17279.93518182534
Ordinary meat for them.	17932.61452774436
A corpse is meat gone bad.	8433.94953544488
Well and what ’ s cheese?	11613.411424843982
Corpse of milk.	15868.195079096857
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	12678.307644458693
Cremation better.	18679.07077551165
Priests dead against it.	17932.61452774436
Devilling for the other firm.	17724.87334026543
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	17570.648302713715
Time of the plague.	11078.523309707847
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	17724.87334026543
Lethal chamber.	18679.07077551165
Ashes to ashes.	16807.8688531982
Or bury at sea.	10120.794185173527
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	8851.468171025732
Eaten by birds.	16807.8688531982
Earth, fire, water.	16727.42622563514
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	16702.430104737632
See your whole life in a flash.	12512.163056174923
But being brought back to life no.	9985.91332034323
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	9034.571298275629
Out of a flying machine.	10290.982402349213
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	14084.27702252152
Underground communication.	18679.07077551165
We learned that from them.	10111.88095965841
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	8537.631198953804
Regular square feed for them.	16727.42622563514
Got wind of Dignam.	11772.687689473321
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	10599.455903117178
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	17076.136894926323
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	9107.247522908538
Back to the world again.	15550.35106674391
Enough of this place.	13956.798509731774
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	15762.484269390725
Poor papa too.	8612.761376991464
The love that kills.	6549.046155587141
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	13972.314388216562
Give you the creeps after a bit.	11805.147628931909
I will appear to you after death.	7252.667277887673
You will see my ghost after death.	8457.201677036262
My ghost will haunt you after death.	11206.014633440205
There is another world after death named hell.	9947.340415747509
I do not like that other world she wrote.	7772.851007049089
No more do I.	6946.62202259447
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	17356.98505688499
Feel live warm beings near you.	14045.438414267495
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	10985.992704078686
They are not going to get me this innings.	8765.583346678373
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	16112.477388603033
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	10898.011273254064
Solicitor, I think.	13498.003490640338
I know his face.	3522.1892063215696
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	14386.018313794837
Dignam used to be in his office.	13951.79759391054
Convivial evenings.	18679.07077551165
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	15313.485572694599
Heart of gold really.	13602.859108471028
Yes, Menton.	4223.907218550617
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	14189.306378232275
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	15762.484269390725
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	11773.697004021464
Hate at first sight.	15393.126810427384
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	12923.780718322694
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	15710.001743080335
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	12180.687155800031
Carriage probably.	18679.07077551165
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	8699.858687349488
They stopped.	5908.339131105127
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	9896.880076989857
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	11187.048561489099
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	7333.5059209501105
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	13256.023157992602
He clapped the hat on his head again.	9132.31827369453
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	4055.3780476503503
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	10420.661240140846
— Thank you, he said shortly.	4939.796963141519
They walked on towards the gates.	9881.954723581033
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	9198.347751645992
Martin laying down the law.	12098.292517801228
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	14639.536554914885
Oyster eyes.	18679.07077551165
Never mind.	9070.866143451834
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	14151.806945807539
Get the pull over him that way.	13304.931214217062
Thank you.	6315.299290613758
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	15654.796114126926
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	14822.526858834526
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	12864.148111504486
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	15238.408737200069
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	16316.883965831477
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	11569.471563910898
— There it is, Red Murray said.	6761.19417740104
Alexander Keyes.	13423.33993185836
— Just cut it out, will you?	6463.161393972178
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	9063.673313888676
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	7403.451920939696
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	16055.812362843053
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	15433.20494002854
Scissors and paste.	18227.54902377354
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	6772.390453425258
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	12092.214023073135
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	7678.938428522063
I ’ ll rub that in.	3580.5199009125786
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	14333.069928784766
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	17724.87334026543
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	12793.653266329742
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	9484.074403340821
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	12772.522263958117
Welts of flesh behind on him.	17570.648302713715
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	16152.865686410112
— Don ’ t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	7847.366982118489
Red Murray whispered.	12738.445015358639
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	8793.750245294414
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	11673.814570318911
Way in.	14855.255256694101
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	13473.808526463858
Mary, Martha.	15175.67984183378
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	16152.79588025226
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	4696.361504258589
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	3193.116423475564
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	12030.020131849637
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	17279.93518182534
Hand on his heart.	17932.61452774436
In <URL> Co - ome thou lost one, Co - ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	14823.504418550518
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	11370.092057475593
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	14721.608349072201
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	14277.384235336416
But will he save the circulation?	9863.782630541877
Thumping.	9728.691757493107
Thumping.	9728.691757493107
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	11407.595707846944
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	15531.101051387097
WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably.	16842.048511082874

His machineries are pegging away too.	10004.661937286033
Like these, got out of hand: fermenting.	12897.749631397288
Working away, tearing away.	16053.975985553223
And that old grey rat tearing to get in.	9076.175182341109
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	16854.754217365455
Strange he never saw his real country.	15762.484269390725

Now if he got paralysed there and no - one knew how to stop them they ’ d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.	14971.399467856982

Want a cool head.	10488.166766154687
— Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	7737.819419769598
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	15446.381252378535
Long John is backing him, they say.	10845.958964801415
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	12160.268680369027
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	10081.350791858324
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	8344.56229903714
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	4931.56561014937
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	10912.054237153572
— Did you?	2460.7865001352466
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	3607.086760905109
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	12250.710157178259
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	6710.515525553937
I ’ ll tap him too.	3580.5199009125786
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	10081.37620633428
Three bob I lent him in Meagher ’ s.	13191.557788237547
Three weeks.	9838.938135192795
Third hint.	16878.573427268955
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	16601.194688851698
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	4962.692482236328
Keyes, you remember?	13447.270470967467
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	10915.427805721041
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	4959.221849294901
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	7212.005184433036
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	3062.51632682224
He wants it changed.	5478.37872355234
Keyes, you see.	9782.200267093456
He wants two keys at the top.	7567.351380769502
Hell of a racket they make.	15024.066288223417
He doesn ’ t hear it.	5308.237864363885
Nannan.	19456.598729469286
Iron nerves.	15707.401234162882
Maybe he understands what I.	15550.35106674391
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	12796.539051571674
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	9130.902019147676
Let him take that in first.	10981.83222963037
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	13037.757725067548
Clank it.	12452.996386040257
Clank it.	12452.996386040257
Miles of it unreeled.	15665.739701619705
What becomes of it after?	8638.7839666994
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	10665.594588749209
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	16959.24882930963
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	17116.015091541452
Two crossed keys here.	10841.848074037694
A circle.	4762.787687825449
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	15323.650063019923
So on.	5590.867382325272
Better not teach him his own business.	11469.84308707887
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	7800.971231379468
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	11706.087997980769
You see?	4523.441826151819
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	8100.18471106567
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	10366.398507918631
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	7157.851829452052
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	8684.099755415342
Innuendo of home rule.	17932.61452774436
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	16644.12510662653
Catches the eye, you see.	14559.597137114562
Can you do that?	8991.367678754606
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	12262.731694586197
Better not.	7264.888313921152
— We can do that, the foreman said.	6248.512400697038
Have you the design?	6326.00303346234
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	3361.283209187024
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	6072.853873867672
He has a house there too.	5696.154900772268
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	4999.643116439455
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	11457.229291525897
Longfelt want.	18679.07077551165
So on.	5590.867382325272
The foreman thought for an instant.	7195.4013990903695
— We can do that, he said.	3658.734387989426
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	11832.845734132245
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	9507.376927886024
He began to check it silently.	6438.823797822329
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	10629.55948336223
ORTHOGRAPHICAL Want to be sure of his spelling.	17356.98505688499

Silly, isn ’ t it?	8591.701459814003
Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	17216.552405491148
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	9843.062076578684
Thank you.	6315.299290613758
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	10249.621498146293
No. I could have said.	7031.247214851891

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	8149.741591481702
— Monks, sir?	5182.699741025079
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	6223.6285580067715
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	8462.277147272149
Time to get out.	9869.941739480142
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	11683.325073887725
— Monks! — Yes, sir.	4777.891915709579
Three months ’ renewal.	10931.822407625861

Old Monks, the dayfather.	11730.65542103653
Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	15995.875801952967
Nearing the end of his tether now.	16158.23444668982

AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.	16899.786054421136
Reads it backwards first.	17932.61452774436
Quickly he does it.	15976.304393411037

And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	11533.874649187273
Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.	16289.334194177056
Justice it means but it ’ s everybody eating everyone else.	16635.20222040897
That ’ s what life is after all.	5166.95674259087
Practice makes perfect.	16807.8688531982
Seems to see with his fingers.	12879.675153827653
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	10351.532796349507
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	14380.2959023436
Better phone him up first.	11777.90867260135

Ah, the soap I put there.	8551.73457561771
Lose it out of that pocket.	16702.430104737632
Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	15689.15403484466
What perfume does your wife use?	5587.444284684019
I could go home still: tram: something I forgot.	9463.617257003069
Just to see: before: dressing.	11835.178287030376
No. Here.	4210.363634038203
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	10477.397111973401
Know who that is.	13498.003490640338
What ’ s up?	2915.200191916108
Ned Lambert it is.	8967.57289980775
He entered softly.	5045.875357055062
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	16854.733822291528
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	13080.253762382496
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	15780.267018009192
What about that, Simon?	7223.370110327829
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	9960.251218215133
How ’ s that for high?	6092.906813892332
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	5451.423384865192
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	13947.532071483924
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	13708.62591866654
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	6912.47122421621
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	5801.566463113455
High falutin stuff.	13492.86464334258
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	11840.699652973675
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	15585.878001150933
He has influence they say.	5401.21053703787
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	13924.233293035995
Close on ninety they say.	16727.42622563514
Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps.	17279.93518182534

Alleluia.	19456.598729469286
— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	6066.320563123367
— What is it?	1285.7135923413941
Mr Bloom asked.	1384.4535954744215
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	9789.563776166395
_Our lovely land_.	18227.54902377354
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	17356.98505688499
Mr Bloom said simply.	3870.369652515145
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	10207.706084527765
With an accent on the whose.	10535.337865370506
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	7433.06421316838
— Is it his speech last night?	5587.277560932975
Mr Bloom asked.	1384.4535954744215
— But listen to this, he said.	4853.385076447682
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	12338.440871129797
— Excuse me, J.	5017.726924234975
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said, entering.	2969.7689410010285
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	4762.327769862231
— I beg yours, he said.	3263.036704280729
— Good day, Jack.	3551.2543774955757
— Come in.	2746.980660995189
Come in.	5796.424264273812
— Good day.	2305.797892013516
— How are you, Dedalus?	4780.964609168764
And yourself?	4975.7915955385515
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy shook his head.	4096.93244970091
SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	17162.1441294529
Decline, poor chap.	14642.13991874213
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	10980.087903806429
Touch and go with him.	12544.03512113
What ’ s in the wind, I wonder.	6088.234552121945
Money worry.	14193.453893600445
— _Or again if we but climb the serried mountain <URL> — You ’ re looking extra.	10457.183366954945
— Is the editor to be seen?	6034.532696262727
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	6155.973691097077
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	5927.957485027581
To be seen and heard.	8620.879805326615
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	4606.835185016402
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	10041.24418886169
Practice dwindling.	16878.573427268955
A mighthavebeen.	4762.787687825449
Losing heart.	18679.07077551165
Gambling.	19456.598729469286
Debts of honour.	18227.54902377354
Reaping the whirlwind.	18227.54902377354
Used to get good retainers from D.	15948.04205195143
and T.	8328.576267391503
Fitzgerald.	19456.598729469286
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	12494.401221103424
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	17279.93518182534
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	16627.414130203724
Wellread fellow.	18679.07077551165
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	14581.933616255794
Weathercocks.	19456.598729469286
Hot and cold in the same breath.	15184.223820049572
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	9887.5271585197
One story good till you hear the next.	12183.768270527717
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	14806.128056338772
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	16682.90235283324
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	8979.849565101937
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	14714.131543516505
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	13902.257195880211
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	16702.366946211594
Is he taking anything for it?	9986.110605322918
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	14698.240678252907
He forgot Hamlet.	5472.076278193412
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	16249.933936461703
Life is too short.	12616.043640326236
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	11981.755551951344
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	12174.401212709496
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	13499.027081863584
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	7179.394409205831
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	16583.598455514977
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	7323.239219399577
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	10001.309375967161
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	17724.87334026543
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	16620.767957823315
Hooked that nicely.	18227.54902377354
Entertainments.	19456.598729469286
Open house.	13208.696921829242
Big blowout.	11107.817728783746
Wetherup always said that.	17932.61452774436
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	12406.292816306337
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	13235.189487826196
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	10118.943941685126
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	8365.016582155467
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	10884.826644159857
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	7313.894072722065
I must get a drink after that.	6866.5130377430805
— Drink! the editor cried.	7179.475851788474
No drinks served before mass.	9402.998833779971
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	7985.102827121316
Come on, Ned.	7834.882965155508
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	10994.905603031631
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	11851.24687229764
— Will you join us, Myles?	6474.9006322865325
Ned Lambert asked.	5007.015961106531
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	16605.35427081293
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	13791.24715161275
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	11279.483856746694
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	6890.310524095767
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	8650.534004064339
Passing out he whispered to J.	15669.322221546165
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	4721.522060789363
Sad case.	12492.20319340747
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	11172.741790158316
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	11832.548152491809
Long, short and long.	13423.858556473508
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	13514.965053827747
— Bingbang, bangbang.	5817.3251072490575
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	8122.763340014209
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	6497.10196844755
I just want to phone about an ad.	9074.065202671134
He went in.	3419.3884170407855
— What about that leader this evening?	4833.01806058004
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	16983.53434559331
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	5576.392682307644
Never you fret.	10227.348794111555
Hello, Jack.	10226.050402085339
That ’ s all right.	1726.9208465377833
— Good day, Myles, J.	4997.931994887655
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	7707.047192079797
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	9848.913947439696
The telephone whirred inside.	5721.176474773992
— Twentyeight...	5817.3251072490575
Double four...	16760.897092969924
Yes.	992.2748593504894
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	17010.718138155575
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	7293.970281856401
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
Sceptre with O.	18227.54902377354
Madden up.	10471.917594461911
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	7774.848238874132
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	17010.718138155575
— Hush, Lenehan said.	5366.24840199673
I hear feetstoops.	4236.04065718322
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	15491.783513279237
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	13113.231882101858
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	6128.27564438761
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	6934.153506409729
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	9767.648017308122
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	4283.159668474655
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	14585.445297361986
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	10565.01433288595
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	6967.240885162806
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	10427.781043447638
— Him, sir.	5817.3251072490575
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	10207.516112748277
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	10427.781043447638
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	10302.727175288352
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	6782.670737160845
Is the boss...?	8232.75385612389
Yes, _Telegraph_...	6237.373916002417
To where?	7236.867882802235
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	11045.61799820121
Aha! I see...	12736.208245324475
Right.	4523.283768958867
I ’ ll catch him.	2562.9594869440443
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	11270.831868365593
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	11183.649862077631
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	11885.391750344044
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	7788.167491341582
Are you hurt?	7194.526420035523
I ’ m in a hurry.	3465.1827066533156
— Knee, Lenehan said.	5366.24840199673
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	11825.407929990739
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	3607.086760905109
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	8885.552051515859
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	5803.787135814708
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	14069.093153563921
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	14987.782782814375
Want to fix it up.	9661.710030820124
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	12319.01687721953
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	8149.764004218022
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	12873.319266776272
— Begone! he said.	5772.393706663396
The world is before you.	6657.399578401511
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	8888.97182711713
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	10507.636421549072
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	9238.566334306359
Look at the young scamps after him.	9985.948200209788
— Show.	2902.1771678372525
Where?	1683.5310292764207
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	12871.244529251178
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	14397.544011223867
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	10734.027471555028
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	9937.625746889446
Small nines.	15707.401234162882
Steal upon larks.	18227.54902377354
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	11335.86848475684
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	7389.212024632937
— What ’ s that?	1070.5066707719686
Myles Crawford said with a start.	9705.199053823477
Where are the other two gone?	8437.264840885631
— Who?	710.3041491697493
the professor said, turning.	9342.062048209624
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	9748.415846473134
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	14960.601221885086
Came over last night.	15976.304393411037
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	4709.085798347228
Where ’ s my hat?	5079.532503700288
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	11739.985428693546
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	13150.474999875622
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	7153.6806688511615
— Seems to be, J.	7179.394409205818
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	9097.413156351859
Who has the most matches?	9047.628547246211
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	13813.840243287144
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	14225.238958690283
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	6909.759743828936
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	9351.082836651893
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	11175.384952159699
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	13567.357048071937
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	8745.392952031963
— Eh?	2546.31996829899
You bloody old Roman empire?	9221.483806420649
Myles Crawford said.	4544.068008453737
He took a cigarette from the open case.	6372.29453722636
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	14632.725311303227
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said gently.	2779.314033199971
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	10359.32896051411
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	9401.121107706495
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	12865.004113558394
— That ’ s it, he said.	2596.6065340127057
We are the fat.	5655.521694566325
You and I are the fat in the fire.	10207.797505696224
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	12927.872631221315
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	13905.939813793833
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	13331.005220201976
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	12409.199402260858
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	12158.165115396192
Vast, I allow: but vile.	17451.623842446083
Cloacae: sewers.	18227.54902377354
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	10692.54148694357
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	10379.950520613414
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	14280.38606016628
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	10203.890561858309
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	11505.411944631092
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	14862.15513076743
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	7698.100972225453
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy murmured.	2888.720941277765
But we have also Roman law.	8598.214255515837
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	7945.484785586023
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	6903.446465425027
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy asked.	2573.583734489577
Everything was going swimmingly...	15669.322221546165
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	6586.779105246946
Are you ready?	7194.526420035523
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	10013.172155319902
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	10780.225349411945
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	9012.648086993968
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	16702.366946211594
— How do you do?	2490.8150316331166
the editor said, holding out a hand.	12022.194698222977
Come in.	5796.424264273812
Your governor is just gone.	12098.292517801228
???	18679.07077551165
Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	13582.904769007604
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	17451.623842446083
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	12878.967216375966
— Who?	710.3041491697493
the editor asked.	9483.315657732199
Bit torn off.	14632.365267767023
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	5156.230685214776
— That old pelters, the editor said.	5703.746896524304
Who tore it?	8856.801548293877
Was he short taken?	10488.378131621295
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	14190.585357799826
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	8044.690961533151
Foot and mouth?	12738.290905111193
Are you turned...?	7640.076088304024
Bullockbefriending bard.	16878.573427268955
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	17076.51569941482
The letter is not mine.	7054.376609466871
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	10184.577495291434
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	7979.7736170926755
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	8916.453222764361
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	14132.38956848197
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	13719.583269831059
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	10758.368375976532
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	5799.374290100324
— Is he a widower?	4098.464810440673
Stephen asked.	2565.8259170644847
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	8637.370876727666
Emperor ’ s horses.	13685.422168597364
Habsburg.	19456.598729469286
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	12708.68770925467
Don ’ t you forget! Maximilian Karl O ’ Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	10700.305760045756
Going to be trouble there one day.	13851.735468486533
Wild geese.	15707.401234162882
O yes, every time.	7016.65312510022
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	10935.435411268072
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	5841.9173073427955
Saving princes is a thank you job.	17451.623842446083
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	12756.833529069809
— And if not?	3380.6783000214446
he said.	2082.9626069148076
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	5314.88933945536
A Hungarian it was one day...	10047.931632725
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	14985.558827748959
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	17076.136894926323
We were never loyal to the successful.	10186.861595174214
We serve them.	8307.619670497574
I teach the blatant Latin language.	8517.708211314763
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	12839.409447200167
Material domination.	18679.07077551165
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	17279.93518182534
Lord Jesus?	11107.817728783746
Lord Salisbury?	11107.817728783746
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	12141.324884177795
— The Greek! he said again.	5607.128740383547
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	17010.718138155575
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	16667.347011617076
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	9576.368708085563
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	16605.27055147329
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	14210.270826070897
They went under.	6042.772914028388
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	16250.700008649876
Loyal to a lost cause.	15786.109314441857
He strode away from them towards the window.	9510.124958484019
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	8848.021437426349
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	9351.00568971699
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	17115.978107251347
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	15313.215558155465
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	11441.296833911883
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	6219.2909121630955
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	12479.352487138447
Whose mother is beastly dead.	16727.42622563514
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	11416.88121253481
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	3125.7623876191046
I ’ ll read the rest after.	4243.822951927111
That ’ ll be all right.	2735.026407338429
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	12475.096924666332
— But my riddle! he said.	5646.723414308462
What opera is like a railwayline?	9368.61122509792
— Opera?	3451.237535283804
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	7284.802225581159
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	13469.91199397477
See the wheeze?	8039.11659184722
Rows of cast steel.	13303.401128114927
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	14866.509868256457
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	9572.350930170665
— Help! he sighed.	6753.184526697845
I feel a strong weakness.	5998.585305082407
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	13560.113639098694
— Paris, past and present, he said.	6688.204681414493
You look like communards.	6712.7597757905
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	9893.946099510427
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	4130.479194182564
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	12747.701239279391
You look as though you had done the deed.	10490.122761000493
General Bobrikoff.	13656.980144780464
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	13582.114810767102
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	5769.0330903758295
Law, the classics...	16702.366946211594
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	5607.128740383547
— Literature, the press.	6753.184526697845
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	6586.747625365943
The gentle art of advertisement.	7475.025159920183
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	6086.645790904292
The vocal muse.	5442.1386306936365
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	16727.42622563514
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	11983.678814540122
— Ahem! he said very softly.	8239.274872544624
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	10386.012402790786
The gate was open.	6549.046155587141
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	15938.209091675748
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	5706.1455447329035
Something with a bite in it.	11122.585096703324
You can do it.	5886.348682812082
I see it in your face.	4981.315863314007
_In the lexicon of youth_...	15068.167196265733
See it in your face.	6822.568814457241
See it in your eye.	7216.514187572068
Lazy idle little schemer.	11955.37773549704
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	9685.858641660778
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	15071.8829622338
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	12363.644672076558
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	15071.8829622338
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	13139.268778740516
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	5930.990567571165
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	11762.037294662376
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	6819.764680292204
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said.	1803.8300168032767
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	14190.606821953746
Wait a minute.	8073.330769808272
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	12925.18735814091
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	16667.447851968176
That was a pen.	4601.181067447078
You know how he made his mark?	8084.8086954593455
I ’ ll tell you.	1758.0822556092824
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	8015.782216909344
I ’ ll show you.	2459.7847457681573
He pushed past them to the files.	8549.71295838215
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	9484.074403340821
Remember that time?	10831.938379460084
Professor MacHugh nodded.	11501.432152066216
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	11163.718525405053
Where it took place.	9584.789320794329
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	17451.623842446083
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	17451.91713403542
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	9415.44524774666
Whole route, see?	15976.304393411037
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	5694.9054727425055
Fitzharris.	19456.598729469286
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	9841.142491805093
Holohan told me.	16807.8688531982
You know Holohan?	4948.173593226032
— Hop and carry one, is it?	7483.683095894566
Myles Crawford said.	4544.068008453737
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	10502.708601434197
A night watchman.	6108.478345590255
Stephen turned in surprise.	7892.2832117402895
— Gumley?	3451.237535283804
he said.	2082.9626069148076
You don ’ t say so?	6570.257738971045
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	8603.729230060308
Look at here.	5673.982723553613
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	6363.655020429231
I ’ ll tell you.	1758.0822556092824
Inspiration of genius.	18227.54902377354
Cabled right away.	18227.54902377354
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	9843.903157416991
Right.	4523.283768958867
Have you got that?	5267.582869391404
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	11049.184269093805
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	10833.254639025601
Have you got that?	5267.582869391404
Right.	4523.283768958867
The telephone whirred.	4627.413957251361
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	11368.142629668462
— B is parkgate.	5817.3251072490575
Good.	3567.3665975662016
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	11827.012255721593
— T is viceregal lodge.	6753.184526697845
C is where murder took place.	12047.101349680637
K is Knockmaroon gate.	14553.805056755707
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	11413.117248412982
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	14302.502726306006
— Hello?	1854.5083703636108
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	17724.87334026543
Hello?...	8403.702196507187

Yes...	3939.6175499890323
Yes...	3939.6175499890323
Yes.	992.2748593504894
— F to P is the route Skin - the - Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	12247.620853908596
<URL>. Got that?	9432.646580660929
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	13724.054420972418
The professor came to the inner door.	7891.92668494471
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	6153.7064325080055
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	9175.12119027627
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	13223.147945045777
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	14777.051890611185
Very.	9941.152936667111
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	11437.33925048227
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	17451.623842446083
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	6127.51371487981
I was present.	3267.148393725029
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	16594.233727773935
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	14682.093638625929
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	10225.323468402516
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	6925.834551158011
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	10450.1109675657
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	9926.864688022066
Out of an advertisement.	9509.61476755927
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	17451.623842446083
That gave him the leg up.	9912.933555173273
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <URL> Now he ’ s got in with Blumenfeld.	14088.269008420983
That ’ s press.	2671.424700236949
That ’ s talent.	2671.424700236949
Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	15558.906711942618
— Hello?...	3194.224690986384
Are you there?...	6963.5670722486575
Yes, he ’ s here still.	7171.666385684197
Come across yourself.	9656.212477753861
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	8827.461633818188
the editor cried.	8744.693302470427
He flung the pages down.	6583.722725361223
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	8594.691365464658
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	4909.8677398494265
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	11433.15259972748
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	12308.438739659969
— O yes, J.	4289.668535803436
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	2779.314033199971
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	16097.800254008842
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin - the - Goat.	11589.491001753402
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! — They ’ re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	14093.157400559678
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	16097.757291019094
Eh?	4374.936102783538
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	14960.500669399546
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	11762.807245824091
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	13858.756305820938
Why did you write it then?	8059.558445303015
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	17570.648302713715
Is the mouth south someway?	9937.798298020645
Or the south a mouth?	9076.728764565958
Must be some.	5028.017018431112
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	16224.754514648872
Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two.	16218.383870415311

O ’ Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	7162.318957946832
— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	11584.999567101144
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	13378.145523948975
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	12456.805300544267
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly ’ s Budget_, _Pue ’ s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	16704.779052957343
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	12527.420419772228
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	17356.98505688499
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE — Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.	16868.50828717011
Irish volunteers.	14855.255256694101
Where are you now?	6427.487008933136

Dr Lucas.	13656.980144780464

Psha! — Well, J.	14775.374523758022
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said, Bushe <URL>., for example.	5570.677962086873
— Bushe?	3451.237535283804
the editor said.	7612.789796888751
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	8973.994622386806
He has a strain of it in his blood.	7616.529443376472
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	17451.623842446083
— He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....	9397.802896834339
But no matter.	7236.647299285792
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	12186.102575947461
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	9327.117812744827
Bushe defended him.	18227.54902377354
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	16360.545038900984
He died in his sleep.	6583.722725361223
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	11287.085254529002
— What was that?	2712.482558520713
the professor asked.	7435.509045485179
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	17041.351916654137
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	8594.511597901172
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	8865.089927133742
— Ha. — A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	9893.9691229298
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	4939.082254756063
False lull.	18679.07077551165
Something quite ordinary.	11185.202976064158
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	16644.041190546446
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	13506.649954738026
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	7210.75792986819
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	14210.295955087064
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	8241.793916730117
— The divine afflatus, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	4594.1789660812365
— You like it?	3475.9868966918298
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy asked Stephen.	3356.7689250660933
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	11166.862264418163
He took a cigarette from the case.	5731.974298041172
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	6152.0996019550885
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: — Muchibus thankibus.	14585.665886216988
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	12535.466719037599
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	3473.1453257466933
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	10229.940906437403
E.	2132.7942562045123
the mastermystic?	10378.159264514383
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	8047.3239486341845
A.	707.4051198927579
E.	2132.7942562045123
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	15380.260073557025
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	17356.98505688499
E. ’ s leg.	9249.470469310752
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	8104.825742746756
Speaking about me.	15868.195079096857
What did he say?	3517.607520824824
What did he say?	3517.607520824824
What did he say about me?	5731.414055926656
Don ’ t ask.	4681.976496443429
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	7551.055396771048
Wait a moment.	6329.993235768595
Let me say one thing.	8661.755496961383
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	12981.943553260058
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	14454.589059814776
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	9334.211763509495
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	11112.815424803295
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	6047.689784326017
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	7195.171004816463
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	9264.007175317214
Go on.	9886.219821179826
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	13426.61368506443
It was then a new movement.	6295.185486733807
We were weak, therefore worthless.	9588.880764093512
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	14262.929806335878
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	17451.623842446083
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	8937.237983440215
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	13298.57344859968
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	12052.070026063153
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	12071.202248877178
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	11057.443774365138
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	9592.704584192617
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	13050.394854474862
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	14063.840097511504
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	16235.486165140785
He raised his head firmly.	6156.209795368533
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	7844.854026131372
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	17076.34351025346
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	13595.711274566022
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	15224.677608666403
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	16194.737672074629
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	14190.09292431546
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	11896.610425276933
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	14466.03617235444
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	10883.24730388791
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	11091.765194598125
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	10815.204617372932
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	13748.08607633101
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	12885.28323379856
Child, man, effigy.	16727.42622563514
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	13610.54643084132
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	14139.651551783698
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	16937.421557610043
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	16883.448887228955
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	14224.892623358353
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	13444.278723079256
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	17570.648302713715
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	9372.572884955525
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	12401.831886871807
And with a great future behind him.	8370.090818833196
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	11681.101320168544
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	6691.797876865502
Gone with the wind.	13498.003490640338
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	17356.98505688499
Miles of ears of porches.	15786.109314441857
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	11413.140265133849
A people sheltered within his voice.	8872.392851107246
Dead noise.	12492.20319340747
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	16051.953953143342
Love and laud him: me no more.	13001.014634647898
I have money.	3287.2976378244143
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	4505.990070953832
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	13881.515458361999
— You take my breath away.	5132.910290442892
It is not perchance a French compliment?	7303.829500122532
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	4836.336344478032
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	14447.927407252175
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	6942.776726826707
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	10801.155099970672
The contrary no.	5442.1386306936365
I declare it carried.	6084.005853682513
To which particular boosing shed...?	8860.808087488726
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	15005.705913696762
Yes, we will not.	5886.372783528673
By no manner of means.	10110.442675311198
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	12892.63457795384
Let us go.	7154.433752502506
Where are those blasted keys?	8121.546828769422
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	10081.350791858324
— Foot and mouth.	4749.897904813009
I know.	1542.5175897738552
That ’ ll be all right.	2735.026407338429
That ’ ll go in.	4598.570044934099
Where are they?	6112.320694322727
That ’ s all right.	1726.9208465377833
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	9623.579539975348
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	11050.025042686464
Myles, one moment.	13303.736415385645
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	9415.412919094404
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	5149.59104969359
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	6083.078668245228
It has the prophetic vision.	7952.8078189314365
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	17279.93518182534
Kingdoms of this world.	17932.61452774436
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	9484.074403340821
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	12725.868894047926
I have much, much to learn.	6738.512517404243
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	9698.284327187881
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	4226.7247178620955
— Yes?	1163.3156576058952
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	11927.537182718042
Crawford will follow.	18227.54902377354
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	15237.321696632118
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	12236.02544663978
— Where is that?	3901.0540870694026
the professor asked.	7435.509045485179
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	5038.882420939256
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	17570.648302713715
Against the wall.	13993.699109352883
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	16158.125825015217
Frantic hearts.	18679.07077551165
Akasic records.	15251.62811167228
Quicker, darlint! On now.	16702.366946211594
Dare it.	18679.07077551165
Let there be life.	10756.234409721395
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	8662.215854708145
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	12319.01687721953
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	13587.017502962563
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	12679.351265565658
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	13458.250003765128
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	7063.258724460513
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	16760.727737707093
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	13920.417700297405
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	15347.533514580351
Glory be to God.	11955.37773549704
They had no idea it was that high.	10517.451948506532
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	13380.543235245055
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	16819.419911419274
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	17010.77867796619
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	8833.656599932736
Vestal virgins.	18679.07077551165
I can see them.	4937.800145163974
What ’ s keeping our friend?	5237.037207317952
He turned.	2146.2902746138093
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	13312.04606158963
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	15783.179865792777
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy.	1732.8811232852825
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	7857.972727020393
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	10803.879064787341
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	11070.188679382294
I see them.	3629.2328616885497
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	12403.156017370642
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	10795.816670657323
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	14157.37587642844
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	8764.903500944465
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	7634.5862905535505
After he ’ ll see.	11640.498666751826
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	11371.11314140487
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	11551.979367955806
I can have access to it in the national library.	8443.69897962054
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	9052.949697646367
His name is Keyes.	7539.846473125008
It ’ s a play on the name.	4567.924518940231
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	9755.928092207307
But he wants just a little puff.	7823.195756200902
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	9195.705391133584
<URL>. — Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	12368.747412298679
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	11221.820491592782
Tell him that straight from the stable.	12076.568660617899
Look out for squalls.	11485.27443672835
All off for a drink.	8524.366005958327
Arm in arm.	18227.54902377354
Lenehan ’ s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	12512.686234355231
Usual blarney.	16878.573427268955
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	14304.073633439088
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	14776.586059585043
Been walking in muck somewhere.	16727.42622563514
What was he doing in Irishtown?	6678.620977342768
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	10152.691901203363
He ’ d give the ad, I think.	5853.012027352551
I ’ ll tell him...	3124.2343237930963
<URL>. — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	12771.482639377475
Any time he likes, tell him.	14594.33082456433
RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	16938.9319887271
I ’ m up to here.	3465.1565006333785
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	6120.031615163148
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	10788.083517760888
Sorry, Jack.	14632.276751995785
You must take the will for the deed.	9842.825512666015
With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.	11730.715590050244

J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	7389.212024632937
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	11370.092057475593
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	13328.05443835642
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	9893.9691229298
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	10250.513723239948
SOME COLUMN! — THAT ’ S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID — That ’ s new, Myles Crawford said.	15015.011999138207
That ’ s copy.	2671.424700236949
Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	13177.024053232206
Two old trickies, what?	10429.472789307507
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	9336.209994579352
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	14287.244075554921
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	14048.758618776845
No poetic licence.	7503.861566893145
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	7923.546150092513
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	10267.310133561441
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	7529.402612113078
I like that.	4593.755356405627
I see the idea.	4999.141540385054
I see what you mean.	5596.682667702224
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	16348.563012662558
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	14777.568154393804
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	9842.564289260368
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	13285.834404263263
— Finished?	3451.237535283804
Myles Crawford said.	4544.068008453737
So long as they do no worse.	10679.913297576779
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	18227.54902377354
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	9660.266374535659
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	11679.462464892558
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	7942.7432508263055
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	11301.807212302929
Poor Penelope.	9201.27671397392
Penelope Rich.	18679.07077551165
They made ready to cross O ’ Connell street.	10562.14598286653
Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.	16782.713263309317
WHAT? — AND LIKEWISE — WHERE?	16682.90235283324
— But what do you call it?	5265.907899032245
Myles Crawford asked.	9058.898731279625
Where did they get the plums?	9574.330529803645
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.	17932.61452774436
SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.	17570.648302713715
— Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to reflect.	10816.115281923983
Call it, let me see.	12830.374710080323
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	11955.338480075254
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	9810.876413544323
He laughed richly.	4259.431819402189
— I see, he said again with new pleasure.	5542.1833751309105
We gave him that idea, he added to J.	11712.783610061511

O ’ Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace.	8719.762036665983
— I see, the professor said.	2834.628734649646
He halted on sir John Gray ’ s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.	12460.611018513266
DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS.	17356.98505688499
— Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly.	8145.289014482269
That tickles me, I must say.	10030.131763405627
— Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty ’ s truth was known.	11826.62808478157

Well, of course, if we knew all the things.	9862.207198717315
Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls.	15090.209505635008
Rough weather outside.	18227.54902377354

It ’ s the droll way he comes out with the things.	6596.139100258671

They wheeled lower.	6318.5241397988175
Looking for grub.	10283.952773294715
Wait.	1374.254002664509
He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball.	9200.99346002225
Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com.	15446.433163739166
Not a bit.	5894.5937612481
The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated under by the bridgepiers.	11921.284113977003
Not such damn fools.	9622.355479913587
Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin ’ s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern.	14238.913487156344
Live by their wits.	15393.126810427384
They wheeled, flapping.	7416.797554973043
The hungry famished gull Flaps o ’ er the waters dull.	8710.595228869355
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	9683.30269180989
But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse.	10132.762502158723

Wait.	1374.254002664509
Those poor birds.	11185.202976064158
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.	13007.872195592827
See that?	8835.324595776232
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey.	12139.65151336103
Gone.	4782.2098951201715
Every morsel.	11288.406558228855

I ’ m not going to throw any more.	4418.1258511136
Penny quite enough.	14632.365267767023
Lot of thanks I get.	13642.603456559395
They spread foot and mouth disease too.	10463.293667862203
If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that.	11179.27927850508
Eat pig like pig.	13956.939215319308
But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty?	10589.477632930768
How is that?	5574.358724951989
His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.	12892.639079403854

After one.	8949.2171529576
Timeball on the ballastoffice is down.	17570.648302713715
Dunsink time.	18679.07077551165
Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball ’ s.	17162.064257603583
Parallax.	16997.075953601572
I never exactly understood.	5222.511736181048
There ’ s a priest.	3531.7083337515073
Par it ’ s Greek: parallel, parallax.	17279.9827036549
Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration.	14131.786261747964
O rocks! Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice.	12249.168687111718
She ’ s right after all.	5395.851622269378
Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.	14132.799648363149
She ’ s not exactly witty.	5129.245875746485
Can be rude too.	11552.58528914052
Blurt out what I was thinking.	16112.538316513788
Still, I don ’ t know.	6064.8063975533605
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.	10666.347340968447
He has legs like barrels and you ’ d think he was singing into a barrel.	10698.585110559785
Now, isn ’ t that wit.	11406.836519882403
They used to call him big Ben.	8969.595541247387
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	12304.7220915156
Appetite like an albatross.	17932.61452774436
Get outside of a baron of beef.	13304.886493112099
Barrel of Bass.	18227.54902377354
It all works out.	8201.386601223077
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	12886.900869707863
Bargains.	19456.598729469286
Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	12975.296636039602
He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H.	10343.189031437123
E.	2132.7942562045123
L.	3652.4191613411995
S.	2246.5143522196063
Wisdom Hely ’ s.	14642.36137843721
Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	15803.952863141747
Our staple food.	10537.512508412203
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	14009.066911507722
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	13307.89471338913
Doesn ’ t bring in any business either.	12483.997642257147
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	13251.177018119373
I bet that would have caught on.	9168.77625240336
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	16224.754514648872
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	15420.105647741242
Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing.	14223.241973685846
Women too.	8328.576267391503
Curiosity.	16997.075953601572
Pillar of salt.	18227.54902377354
Wouldn ’ t have it of course because he didn ’ t think of it himself first.	12684.251971385092
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid.	12248.272246351567
His ideas for ads like Plumtree ’ s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	13222.8233443756
You can ’ t lick ’ em.	7446.927937090408
What?	694.4811020788688
Our envelopes.	9416.023915768359
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	13538.583955873293
Can ’ t stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser _Kansell, _ sold by Hely ’ s Ltd, <NUM> Dame street.	13602.02943606594
Well out of that ruck I am.	12077.785038876284
Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.	15771.461168324415
Tranquilla convent.	18679.07077551165
That was a nice nun there, really sweet face.	8720.568827935791
Wimple suited her small head.	17724.87334026543
Sister?	8498.96645492669
Sister?	8498.96645492669
I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.	8681.5791210284
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	14555.40911728233
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	9725.28344188899
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	10936.512541143786
Our great day, she said.	9053.998321167224
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.	17451.682501789175
Sweet name too: caramel.	14820.693222644375
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	11233.805424434104
If she had married she would have changed.	10981.900500569225
I suppose they really were short of money.	8466.504638876371
Fried everything in the best butter all the same.	14682.819039015145
No lard for them.	8559.348879233634
My heart ’ s broke eating dripping.	10853.518807135997
They like buttering themselves in and out.	9450.426275565527
Molly tasting it, her veil up.	13182.279534254132
Sister?	8498.96645492669
Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker ’ s daughter.	13175.46458731737
It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.	7278.655513428866
He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by.	9515.600009609134
Rover cycleshop.	18679.07077551165
Those races are on today.	12505.304740148655
How long ago is that?	9184.51589889024
Year Phil Gilligan died.	15976.304393411037
We were in Lombard street west.	6835.567476405885
Wait: was in Thom ’ s.	10736.664158682714
Got the job in Wisdom Hely ’ s year we married.	12703.132977521534
Six years.	12825.524320071201
Ten years ago: ninetyfour he died yes that ’ s right the big fire at Arnott ’ s.	15598.856559979531

Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman.	17451.623842446083
Couldn ’ t hear what the band played.	10710.62504744311
Milly was a kiddy then.	13292.258639585922
Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs.	13735.689917855618
Mantailored with selfcovered buttons.	17932.61452774436
She didn ’ t like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf.	12137.916204488465
As if that.	8039.990746534646
Old Goodwin ’ s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	13924.233293035995
Flies ’ picnic too.	17932.61452774436
Never put a dress on her back like it.	12807.368717479292
Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips.	17279.93518182534
Just beginning to plump it out well.	11835.178287030376
Rabbitpie we had that day.	17724.87334026543
People looking after her.	13956.939215319308
Happy.	9031.408469903961
Happier then.	18679.07077551165
Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.	17279.93518182534
Dockrell ’ s, one and ninepence a dozen.	16654.676505129108
Milly ’ s tubbing night.	13292.258639585922
American soap I bought: elderflower.	17570.648302713715
Cosy smell of her bathwater.	16727.42622563514
Funny she looked soaped all over.	15024.066288223417
Shapely too.	15707.401234162882
Now photography.	8532.331730453821
Poor papa ’ s daguerreotype atelier he told me of.	12597.117598169158
Hereditary taste.	18679.07077551165
He walked along the curbstone.	4827.725686094323
Stream of life.	18227.54902377354
What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed?	10974.29499957993
Weak eyes, woman.	15393.126810427384
Stopped in Citron ’ s saint Kevin ’ s parade.	14683.583908877905
Pen something.	16878.573427268955
Pendennis?	19456.598729469286
My memory is getting.	9872.178046021547
Pen...?	11980.699522191517
Of course it ’ s years ago.	8714.470616965844
Noise of the trams probably.	17724.87334026543
Well, if he couldn ’ t remember the dayfather ’ s name that he sees every day.	12057.61924116556
Bartell d ’ Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	15243.88151396452
Seeing her home after practice.	16053.975985553223
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	17570.648302713715
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	16644.083149168233
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin ’ s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	16760.727737707093
He and I behind.	6579.054785218161
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	16614.95473623039
Lucky it didn ’ t.	14540.717306624887
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	16271.04294698232
Professor Goodwin linking her in front.	13549.231860963027
Shaky on his pins, poor old sot.	17356.98505688499
His farewell concerts.	7402.72619810262
Positively last appearance on any stage.	17570.648302713715
May be for months and may be for never.	15071.8829622338
Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up.	14493.805195233374
Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust.	17451.623842446083
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.	17041.351916654137
She did get flushed in the wind.	9250.365447541144
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	15583.018900312003
And the mulled rum.	4470.600631067354
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	15253.157117416791
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	16249.81104549519
Always warm from her.	12323.296396078802
Always liked to let her self out.	13590.163994936875
Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins.	15710.001743080335
Milly tucked up in beddyhouse.	13292.258639585922
Happy.	9031.408469903961
Happy.	9031.408469903961
That was the night...	6110.728819111336
— O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	4648.820775582061
— O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	5718.314073483809
— No use complaining.	3747.6489751216704
How is Molly those times?	8896.390946040916
Haven ’ t seen her for ages.	12658.26719075692
— In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	7434.003673988798
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	13282.159508259538
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	9380.380614076292
— Yes.	607.5585411172303
In a photographer ’ s there.	7872.936734807858
Getting on like a house on fire.	16682.90235283324
How are all your charges?	7604.399767126544
— All on the baker ’ s list, Mrs Breen said.	8749.989987993828
— You ’ re in black, I see.	4861.296916413582
You have no...	6410.631381378688
— No, Mr Bloom said.	1270.5909884432983
I have just come from a funeral.	6441.689744525366
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	14303.83769774618
Who ’ s dead, when and what did he die of?	9968.060858709461
Turn up like a bad penny.	15316.311760780676
— O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	4749.374669927712
I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	8901.648722454347
May as well get her sympathy.	14559.54209314761
— Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	3607.086760905109
An old friend of mine.	9004.00889221997
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	7722.187759200255
Heart trouble, I believe.	14820.693222644375
Funeral was this morning.	15976.304393411037
Your funeral ’ s tomorrow While you ’ re coming through the rye.	14288.568898430934
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	17724.87334026543
— Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen ’ s womaneyes said melancholily.	10976.312152578023
Now that ’ s quite enough about that.	9895.817122134422
Just: quietly: husband.	11399.537999081615
— And your lord and master?	5026.989296345241
Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	15092.406378180784
— O, don ’ t be talking! she said.	4776.87183927131
He ’ s a caution to rattlesnakes.	3537.996451493321
He ’ s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	7795.719785396801
He has me heartscalded.	4482.664542482273
Wait till I show you.	6041.784068842105
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison ’ s.	15802.380317054405
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom ’ s gullet.	11115.491701600458
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they ’ d taste it with the hot tea.	14303.580368954632
Or is it from her?	8905.1844150937
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	11583.29174846246
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	17451.623842446083
Pleasure or pain is it?	17724.87334026543
Penny dinner.	14193.453893600445
Knife and fork chained to the table.	14236.979759680611
Opening her handbag, chipped leather.	17570.648302713715
Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things.	17215.988293285944
Stick it in a chap ’ s eye in the tram.	16635.086093072554

Raise Cain.	18679.07077551165
Husband barging.	15707.401234162882
Where ’ s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday?	8756.236744958358
Are you feeding your little brother ’ s family?	11324.792730253337
Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle.	16760.897092969924
Pastille that was fell.	17932.61452774436
What is she?...	4625.674174758464
— There must be a new moon out, she said.	5837.396969568146
He ’ s always bad then.	3521.3139618063965
Do you know what he did last night?	6760.9488153493385
Her hand ceased to rummage.	9970.211575772451
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	12618.050111993676
— What?	681.7536505896779
Mr Bloom asked.	1384.4535954744215
Let her speak.	8593.05328764482
Look straight in her eyes.	11417.524188501007
I believe you.	4454.344058266697
Trust me.	16878.573427268955
— Woke me up in the night, she said.	7919.024079079805
Dream he had, a nightmare.	16702.366946211594
Indiges.	19456.598729469286
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	9893.9691229298
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	5210.372590021303
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	9243.584353215369
— Read that, she said.	5481.432352279292
He got it this morning.	7082.073948416487
— What is it?	1285.7135923413941
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	5421.7234796100865
U.	3158.059116295929
P.?	4259.884787828849
— U.	3451.237535283804
p: up, she said.	6389.424510824138
Someone taking a rise out of him.	12847.605311354893
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	6146.15988901625
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	4696.375711354343
She took back the card, sighing.	9064.887817403001
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	8510.42882403391
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	7064.728121573595
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	12150.727887565497
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	14866.060239956112
Seen its best days.	16760.897092969924
Wispish hair over her ears.	17724.87334026543
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	10092.866024020472
Shabby genteel.	18679.07077551165
She used to be a tasty dresser.	8779.743171776834
Lines round her mouth.	16760.897092969924
Only a year or so older than Molly.	12303.388836756014
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	11910.832927705376
Cruel.	11785.351918411056
The unfair sex.	5442.1386306936365
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	9840.81111547884
Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	16760.897092969924
I ’ m hungry too.	2772.0210480994833
Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.	16937.421557610043
Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior.	17279.93518182534

A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	13432.611592484607

— Ay, he said, sighing.	4745.6883783280655
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	7680.577130866108
Will I tell him that horse Lenehan?	12017.10889181722

Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky.	16627.414130203724
No sound.	4544.530949956641
The sky.	3725.095356282331
Green by Drumleck.	13492.86464334258
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	18227.54902377354
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	17076.136894926323
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	16819.474425028202
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	13900.088800629224
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	17041.351916654137
Yum.	19456.598729469286
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.	16289.263798257522
Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.	17215.988293285944

Young life, her lips that gave me pouting.	14576.525972752646
Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips.	14820.693222644375
Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes.	16249.81104549519
Pebbles fell.	18679.07077551165
She lay still.	6983.769204948485
A goat.	4762.787687825449
No - one.	3226.65960798326
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	17570.648302713715
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	16742.249279605705
Hot I tongued her.	14553.805056755707
She kissed me.	5049.225352572128
All yielding she tossed my hair.	10383.476819970887
Kissed, she kissed me.	17724.87334026543
Me. And me now.	13894.212333769912
Stuck, the flies buzzed.	16053.975985553223
His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.	12135.437873489916
Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty.	15551.32576810267
Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires.	16271.04294698232
Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked goddesses.	14322.006150339348
Aids to digestion.	18227.54902377354
They don ’ t care what man looks.	8543.00644924962
All to see.	7856.268068370497
Never speaking.	9070.866143451834
I mean to say to fellows like Flynn.	7899.7431725176275
Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?	13378.065668615613
Mortal! Put you in your proper place.	17356.98505688499
Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial.	17162.064257603583
Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop.	13301.007549991084
Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian.	14369.103464748194
Immortal lovely.	18679.07077551165
And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.	13992.781591984443
They have no.	5372.631175237242
Never looked.	9070.866143451834
I ’ ll look today.	2877.728221529232
Bend down let something fall see if she.	16667.347011617076
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	16937.421557610043
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	13751.016663221246
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	14761.185055167674
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	10193.573052767777
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	5495.846240630564
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	10453.303514556737
Is he in trouble?	7890.576009005636
— Trouble?	3451.237535283804
Nosey Flynn said.	5790.279684537749
Not that I heard of.	10395.469249408516
Why?	1363.914055113649
— Was he?	2720.1249247465457
Nosey Flynn said.	5790.279684537749
So he was, faith.	7422.282025318137
I asked him how was all at home.	8130.083856456832
You ’ re right, by God.	6163.750891191285
So he was.	5843.592671051229
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	10667.068917603558
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	11277.698377779583
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	5179.873141433733
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	14168.045189071374
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	6626.425060000866
Plovers on toast.	18227.54902377354
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	7987.346382260075
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	11191.993553590388
You can make bacon of that.	8015.815033021988
— How so?	2896.940239766005
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	13175.345057817616
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	13398.366241190604
He winked.	4150.831484335753
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	3839.2782558304125
— Do you tell me so?	4461.513600843571
Davy Byrne said.	6768.247150548054
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	4999.046776793416
Ancient free and accepted order.	17724.87334026543
He ’ s an excellent brother.	3069.5016860355163
Light, life and love, by God.	14340.174027264235
They give him a leg up.	9393.657833519004
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	10018.322213550335
— Is that a fact?	2239.668328224125
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	5494.500669188381
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	10958.735930721004
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	10069.380217087857
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	10966.749561540199
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	15012.869312055225
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	13444.652441771144
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	9092.252125646974
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	14080.492289604603
Decent quiet man he is.	14675.272723149948
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	12291.30588719586
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	10103.935299697037
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	17356.98505688499
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	11513.924936426307
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	9468.155683043815
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	13390.168304001685
Declare to God he does.	13722.33635234138
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	6167.780241687749
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	6752.804182725081
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	7983.861307254605
Give the devil his due.	11362.361865908373
O, Bloom has his good points.	7225.819140813703
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	11405.44466448231
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	10536.82942085483
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	2681.087680992641
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	7327.472020524126
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	13241.628913702965
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	13526.162180463436
— Day, Mr Byrne.	6014.514581431308
— Day, gentlemen.	5081.952815573265
They paused at the counter.	8665.183796792235
— Who ’ s standing?	3514.22652374266
Paddy Leonard asked.	8694.984251113727
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	4671.77940810683
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	5164.637084318446
Paddy Leonard asked.	8694.984251113727
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	4783.193850390623
— How much?	2521.963473922722
Paddy Leonard cried.	11089.661755221658
Since when, for God ’ sake?	15762.537251106416
What ’ s yours, Tom?	5237.0768135814615
— How is the main drainage?	5290.987084293635
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	10562.176828659023
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	12778.14418820893
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	10431.369417775559
he said.	2082.9626069148076
— Certainly, sir.	3293.5114944990596
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	12428.913293816817
— Lord love a duck, he said.	6109.680230095968
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	14184.02573844343
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	9448.385012141498
A dead snip.	5632.710288770742
— Zinfandel is it?	5817.3251072490575
Nosey Flynn asked.	8830.121633998802
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	14225.259157334922
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	6942.776726826707
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	7460.454163273617
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	11729.591673338178
— Is it Zinfandel?	3248.554952116755
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	7628.587534281958
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	5807.535620077643
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	10627.907952943015
Who gave it to you?	10584.962188229216
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	8920.501509880325
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	6034.370520701511
The others turned.	5442.1386306936365
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	8833.282560747075
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	13129.110867420684
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	8833.282560747075
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	3668.16870539189
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	9111.153617655318
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	14223.241973685846
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	11446.819978563719
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	14607.371478187397
Surfeit.	19456.598729469286
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	16667.347011617076
First sweet then savoury.	12026.020676764052
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	4344.299241510347
Ruminants.	19456.598729469286
Their upper jaw they move.	12222.323995080058
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	12611.6983461619
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn ’ s mouth.	17279.93518182534
Lean people long mouths.	15976.304393411037
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	13608.06525540792
Course then you ’ d have all the cranks pestering.	14936.365076326441
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M ’ invitasti.	12479.491400941011
Feel better.	10785.263627919488
Burgundy.	19456.598729469286
Good pick me up.	10421.353401935503
Who distilled first?	8856.801548293877
Some chap in the blues.	12127.917139715431
Dutch courage.	18679.07077551165
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	11754.699086058201
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	16601.2211208026
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	14740.270870172766
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	11564.213602068074
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	9351.00568971699
Tonight perhaps.	16878.573427268955
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	14788.789992290252
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	15898.98236476088
That ’ ll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight.	7627.054483680952
Three Hynes owes me.	11696.042057554145
Two eleven.	8781.017118191983
Prescott ’ s dyeworks van over there.	17451.682501789175
If I get Billy Prescott ’ s ad: two fifteen.	10936.303768723446
Five guineas about.	11390.02214777446
On the pig ’ s back.	7452.835532275651
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	15109.792538531152
Today.	10940.661888558341
Not think.	7341.9588068610365
Tour the south then.	17932.61452774436
What about English wateringplaces?	6292.515181937445
Brighton, Margate.	18227.54902377354
Piers by moonlight.	18227.54902377354
Her voice floating out.	9805.387013490194
Those lovely seaside girls.	9290.66102621611
Against John Long ’ s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	16160.886014206118
Handy man wants job.	17932.61452774436
Small wages.	15707.401234162882
Will eat anything.	11185.202976064158
Mr Bloom turned at Gray ’ s confectioner ’ s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan ’ s bookstore.	11665.625175779382
_Why I left the church of Rome?	15948.095657373988
Birds ’ <URL> Women run him.	15669.322221546165
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	12713.490258745933
Same bait.	11107.817728783746
No tram in sight.	8559.348879233634
Wants to cross.	12738.367963498129
— Do you want to cross?	3642.865701030578
Mr Bloom asked.	1384.4535954744215
The blind stripling did not answer.	6750.338866451061
His wallface frowned weakly.	8463.106177213733
He moved his head uncertainly.	6414.485124194663
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	3927.9727341248235
Molesworth street is opposite.	17932.61452774436
Do you want to cross?	5884.586250062392
There ’ s nothing in the way.	5622.3467780596975
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	8849.007850220909
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	10770.682040755568
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	12168.253842213486
Horse drooping.	16878.573427268955
Driver in John Long ’ s.	17570.71474456905
Slaking his drouth.	18227.54902377354
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	7581.900286479348
I ’ ll see you across.	3580.5740580802053
— Yes, the stripling answered.	3193.116423475564
South Frederick street.	15868.195079096857
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	2358.0475212722713
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	12095.37417351807
Say something to him.	12553.74482835707
Better not do the condescending.	10332.971704510683
They mistrust what you tell them.	9881.954723581033
Pass a common remark.	15976.304393411037
— The rain kept off.	4117.214073987361
No answer.	5565.848880227834
Stains on his coat.	17932.61452774436
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	14775.430373562496
Tastes all different for him.	16053.975985553223
Have to be spoonfed first.	10757.577591070643
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	11509.635525531838
Like Milly ’ s was.	10563.636108553237
Sensitive.	16997.075953601572
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	17356.98505688499
Wonder if he has a name.	9441.943992624296
Van.	16997.075953601572
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	15032.329151619613
That ’ s right.	2293.151458022524
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	15637.762590104654
— Thanks, sir.	4286.371448740334
Knows I ’ m a man.	15024.57754371739
Voice.	19456.598729469286
— Right now?	3674.713374409653
First turn to the left.	11398.553753060041
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	11750.867549634744
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	9456.682375963368
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	14276.680846901747
Must have felt it.	8033.122657990971
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	13819.95562449056
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	16271.04294698232
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	13288.226273816646
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	15570.544220426224
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	14144.550125509379
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	17116.015091541452
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	15323.650063019923
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	11715.724207234707
Read with their fingers.	13956.939215319308
Tune pianos.	18679.07077551165
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	12314.502680146012
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	13874.083811631448
Of course the other senses are more.	9536.039065484412
Embroider.	19456.598729469286
Plait baskets.	18679.07077551165
People ought to help.	13956.939215319308
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	17280.03022417759
Hates sewing.	18679.07077551165
Might take an objection.	11078.523309707847
Dark men they call them.	14298.03813175933
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	17451.623842446083
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	16682.958428308033
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	9569.359358057622
Tastes?	15443.024084639697
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	12135.659065569354
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	14210.793451538484
And with a woman, for instance.	7408.367815783274
More shameless not seeing.	12553.74482835707
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	10846.473066625731
Look at me.	7236.649014185537
I have them all on.	5214.752225188941
Must be strange not to see her.	8926.070999458732
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	13112.497407465198
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	11908.072938874073
His hands on her hair, for instance.	9042.927838733807
Say it was black, for instance.	11275.517262525362
Good.	3567.3665975662016
We call it black.	9316.809644546893
Then passing over her white skin.	10442.415989240184
Different feel perhaps.	15868.195079096857
Feeling of white.	18227.54902377354
Postoffice.	15443.024084639697
Fag today.	18679.07077551165
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	14952.637290865337
Accept my little present.	14642.13991874213
Stationer ’ s just here too.	17570.648302713715
Wait.	1374.254002664509
Think over it.	13814.400447318581
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	12420.53983246983
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	12459.50320710447
Downy hair there too.	17932.61452774436
Not smooth enough.	8635.62183246531
The belly is the smoothest.	7475.025159920183
No - one about.	3959.6000793055086
There he goes into Frederick street.	8059.922963066178
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	14190.09292431546
Might be settling my braces.	10026.57789075056
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	16071.272430791056
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	9310.915046199001
Want to try in the dark to see.	11350.209839072786
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	9289.520546346743
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	12332.019361343902
Terrible.	14336.178182593083
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	10495.011547250431
Life a dream for him.	13894.212333769912
Where is the justice being born that way?	9811.685597074396
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	11241.089199563083
Holocaust.	19456.598729469286
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	16368.551212643826
Dear, dear, dear.	13493.54887677821
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	15531.127153354108
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	14799.503916308087
Solemn as Troy.	16807.8688531982
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	12583.592156588078
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	12244.316053539786
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	17115.978107251347
I sentenced him to ten years.	8517.708211314763
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	10880.471312595218
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	17116.015091541452
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	14332.812561366762
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	15950.473344786498
Sends them to the rightabout.	17724.87334026543
The devil on moneylenders.	5834.595658445753
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	16702.366946211594
Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	12785.34774918895
Power those judges have.	15976.304393411037
Crusty old topers in wigs.	17724.87334026543
Bear with a sore paw.	15150.556721689854
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	8341.367253431687
Hello, placard.	11089.795895695737
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	7959.805525315841
Sixteenth.	19456.598729469286
Today it is.	15175.67984183378
In aid of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital.	9234.568154725275
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	13759.066380780712
Yes.	992.2748593504894
Handel.	19456.598729469286
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	8682.063330215064
No use sticking to him like a leech.	9978.080470547004
Wear out my welcome.	17932.61452774436
Sure to know someone on the gate.	14594.33082456433
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	5767.466893141533
First I must.	9395.548860867675
Library.	19456.598729469286
Straw hat in sunlight.	17932.61452774436
Tan shoes.	18679.07077551165
Turnedup trousers.	18679.07077551165
It is.	2059.323762131058
It is.	2059.323762131058
His heart quopped softly.	8463.106177213733
To the right.	6852.84383538321
Museum.	19456.598729469286
Goddesses.	19456.598729469286
He swerved to the right.	6583.722725361223
Is it?	5858.515631265558
Almost certain.	14855.255256694101
Wine in my face.	15393.126810427384
Why did I?	4945.163966870386
Too heady.	9838.938135192795
Yes, it is.	2762.6760716124836
The walk.	4122.464502427211
Not see.	7341.9588068610365
Get on.	10144.946496005443
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	16305.071706695358
Handsome building.	15707.401234162882
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	11791.711066379763
Not following me?	8635.62183246531
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	9134.966588703932
Light in his eyes.	11327.214568432253
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	10403.99829904407
Quick.	7721.979191697367
Cold statues: quiet there.	14820.693222644375
Safe in a minute.	11297.408818907454
No. Didn ’ t see me.	6754.360313575722
After two.	8949.2171529576
Just at the gate.	10015.025393606444
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	12841.934768416755
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	13196.476461389599
Look for something I.	11485.27443672835
Where did I?	6006.763589600969
Busy looking.	18679.07077551165
He thrust back quick Agendath.	7082.073948416487
Afternoon she said.	16807.8688531982
I am looking for that.	4999.459914418532
Yes, that.	4223.907218550617
Try all pockets.	13211.596235347006
Handker.	19456.598729469286

— All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow.	10331.39089085213

Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	10613.578017773476
He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	12095.37417351807
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	12858.542360777583
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	14549.461540499604
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	11228.770848432676

France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer ’ s Phæacians.	16790.99485282068
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	13359.06039208783
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	10448.197030706167
The one about <URL> He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui - même_, don ’ t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	11011.26300596583

_Hamlet ou_...	16760.897092969924
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	5607.128740383547
John Eglinton laughed.	8093.369298729931
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	4525.604897153912
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	16289.263798257522
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	17570.648302713715
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	7356.9074017507355
Not for nothing was he a butcher ’ s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	13818.638759708758

The devil and the deep sea.	7569.429517727245
— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	10814.388834082903
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	13412.109712632695
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	16609.827111563896
If thou didst ever...	11118.111404324147
— What is a ghost?	3220.284200611307
Stephen said with tingling energy.	9002.68499756291
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	13952.194865286556
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	17041.351916654137
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning to the world that has forgotten him?	12426.563255350206
Who is King Hamlet?	7515.478904715974
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	12558.985398013192
Lifted.	19456.598729469286

— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	12431.985847308917
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	11847.2578010925
The swan of Avon has other thoughts.	8916.453222764361
Composition of place.	18227.54902377354
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	13836.511832892209
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	14114.851319546646
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	13366.424276621521
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	15277.882505909492
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	15881.69045551626
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	10268.623411354942
Art thou there, truepenny?	16053.975985553223
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	8239.274872544624
I mean, we have the plays.	6332.063024367765
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	11629.191454648799
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	13422.369291133176
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	15814.916620108754
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	10444.665606114226

John Eglinton ’ s carping voice asked.	11116.086952492255
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	12431.841110369038
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	11803.893607714588
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	9516.822760326237
She saw him into and out of the world.	9970.254861623303
She took his first embraces.	7635.396837828368
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	13812.632768214515

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	12274.837264437681
— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	10951.111154731218
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	7552.619014829941
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	7791.374110117242
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	11827.012255721593
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	16937.421557610043
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	11027.064023123867
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	10495.011547250431
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	11325.79244342661
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	14160.597908670019
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	14011.470753682108
Mr Best ’ s quiet voice said forgetfully.	8569.219623056422
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	10208.919627163441
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	14736.285261059524
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	8363.166328234478
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	14808.440650735349
That memory, _Venus and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light - of - love in London.	13724.181293500536

Come! — Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	14627.616815595007
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	12621.482017365712

Piper is coming.	18227.54902377354
— Piper! Mr Best piped.	7552.619014829941
Is Piper back?	9738.638533683663
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	15824.332008050467
— I don ’ t know if I can.	4171.850531064421
Thursday.	11785.351918411056
We have our meeting.	6659.526991765364

— They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest.	10656.966775089288
Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses.	13162.163573574124
We are all looking forward anxiously.	7665.231584475149
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	17010.718138155575
See this.	8835.324595776232

I liked Colum ’ s <URL> Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius.	12310.22070881437

Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	17724.87334026543
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	16702.366946211594
Did you hear Miss Mitchell ’ s joke about Moore and Martyn?	11970.761922046851
That Moore is Martyn ’ s wild oats?	10980.12111998029
Awfully clever, isn ’ t it?	11048.468227231842

— Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	8321.370058269431
— O, yes.	1762.5338686431237
If he considers it important it will go in.	10609.516422868659
We have so much correspondence.	8035.152131031938

Stephen sat down.	8480.332369056065
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	7456.518511930245
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	17010.718138155575
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	14568.183252148525
Alarmed face asks me.	17932.61452774436
Why did he come?	5651.665718977668
Courtesy or an inward light?	17724.87334026543
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	10412.176765691445
— Yes.	607.5585411172303
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	17279.93518182534
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters ’ wives.	15510.37723237058
Fox and geese.	18227.54902377354
And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	14206.41290041826
— Yes.	607.5585411172303
So you think...	9989.305463893934
The door closed behind the outgoer.	6709.320749378094
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	16614.95473623039
A vestal ’ s lamp.	8117.899790053171
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	15580.821822411926
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	17076.136894926323
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	17215.988293285944
And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest.	8654.54707761715
_In painted chambers loaded with <URL> They are still.	15898.98236476088
Once quick in the brains of men.	14440.640581436473
Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	14976.388482067645
— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	10328.732121334031
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	11351.774085186444
Not even so much.	8572.63060502773
Others abide our question.	17932.61452774436
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	9088.589254011245
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	6231.070464154541
Mr Best pleaded.	5225.023362048703
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	7836.559465988566
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	9162.81029495635
His private papers in the original.	9174.38483019673
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	17570.648302713715
Taim in mo shagart_.	17932.61452774436
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	14559.54209314761
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	16712.893709317497
Bear with me.	14632.276751995785
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	13023.198210728438
A basilisk.	4762.787687825449
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	16654.630702959552
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	17279.9827036549
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	13513.195660042955
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	14447.142768801243
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	13931.826417574306
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	14486.978764454392
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	17356.98505688499
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	3205.541663398011
I feel Hamlet quite young.	5998.585305082407
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	12338.421226245811
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	12825.316360452105
He is in my father.	5147.906823250853
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	8750.13206991943
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	11115.974864656244
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	11611.406589612205
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	12139.67191557091
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	7347.062869907457
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	10107.94959352571
Said that.	16878.573427268955
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	13108.818945128254
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	13879.05101484618
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	15446.433163739166
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	9129.263550783215
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	10161.420056220959
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	10403.972071259352
Good Bacon: gone musty.	11131.094344021754
Shakespeare Bacon ’ s wild oats.	15316.3696780614
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	17932.61452774436
Seekers on the great quest.	17724.87334026543
What town, good masters?	8638.7839666994
Mummed in names: A.	17724.87334026543
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n - og_.	17010.77867796619
Booted the twain and staved.	17724.87334026543
How many miles to Dublin?	8318.777179849912
Three score and ten, sir.	12122.006201932873
Will we be there by candlelight?	12948.96427078159
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	10816.511099052914
— Does he?	4720.890658155755
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	12790.337574214715
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	12731.11103585109
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	10971.506966817946
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	16581.456599053643
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	8249.200822798728
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	17279.93518182534
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	11743.888865213443
Do you know what you are talking about?	6492.318779090557
Such an appeal will touch him.	14369.103464748194
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	10781.081801603794
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	10781.081801603794
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	8812.2230593837
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	11458.415251470857
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	16682.90235283324
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	12135.437873489916
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	16959.24882930963
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	10403.972071259352
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	16899.809292592803
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	9510.124958484019
Dost love, Miriam?	14932.412306617918
Dost love thy man?	14932.412306617918
— That may be too, Stephen said.	4605.256306273525
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	15374.503447440682
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	15069.566302833095
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	11477.078940814781
Why?	1363.914055113649
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	13254.20436679236
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	16702.366946211594
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	11136.5984024571
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	11413.09423104223
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	13166.889153734272
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	14408.622516737803
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	11861.08857236919
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	9187.024300396337
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	10399.553313356848
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	14344.111753774132
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	13816.756325540091
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	13468.486421560265
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	13693.473318366809
His beaver is up.	8463.106177213733
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	13830.946662206594
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	8482.313328560254
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	16667.347011617076
_Entr ’ acte_.	18227.54902377354
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	13921.563639447637
My telegram.	7629.7325899688285
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	8622.335020709193
he asked of Stephen.	7106.1922255914515
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	17115.978107251347
They make him welcome.	7781.034807371525
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	16959.24882930963
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	15603.310615591658
He lifts his hands.	6149.179198239481
Veils fall.	18679.07077551165
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	8886.288143688784
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	4818.812421142078
A most instructive discussion.	6739.606845273537
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	12324.386953394065
All sides of life should be represented.	10933.863096708925
He smiled on all sides equally.	7220.11500147173
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	9195.023174200873
he said.	2082.9626069148076
I seem to know the name.	8517.708211314763
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	10512.986157440577
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	7983.23522915319
The chap that writes like Synge.	8254.458994756533
Mr Best turned to him.	7260.777243405093
— Haines missed you, he said.	4723.092825301855
Did you meet him?	7786.168164320242
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	6586.726857884819

— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	10835.065389551926
<URL> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	15059.144811571781
— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	7689.958675646025
the quaker librarian asked.	10587.520927784351

— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	8479.402335189558
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	11567.893604271663
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	4900.308335998543
The light touch.	5442.1386306936365
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	12645.73563121988
Tame essence of Wilde.	17932.61452774436
You ’ re darned witty.	4927.267878039948

The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	10781.081801603794
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	10952.628284483206
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	8442.874528436365
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	12251.933864451237
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	11472.599729500736
— Telegram! he said.	5772.393706663396
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	14673.226114614332

Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	17162.064257603583
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	14339.223177703074
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	15238.217888860023
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	12874.961263999969
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	14576.974786339026
Stephen laughed.	7177.298625627132
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	16158.125825015217
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	8892.113425655687
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	8923.859902643127
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	5174.155150163141
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	6373.156737984755
That was your contribution to literature.	7266.757328840809
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	10872.138197357302
— Murder you! he laughed.	7552.619014829941
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	16854.733822291528

— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	9175.035791852959
—...	1960.4740354311734
in which everyone can find his own.	15184.17278218577
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	14141.14112861434
Yes?	4075.479007210154
What is it?	1868.65751089726
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	9084.069509194818
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	12544.492998455347
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	5738.923046614039
Is the gentleman?...	7893.851922715508
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	11801.280013781814
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	10060.51873068663
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	12831.464624647919
— This gentleman?	3930.4639972732775
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	17451.623842446083
Good day, sir.	9740.471047398854
_Kilkenny_...	18227.54902377354

Please, sir...	11928.470685289447
The door closed.	3906.1912663981743
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	5360.1599783781785
He jumped up and snatched the card.	8943.670073404995
— What ’ s his name?	2171.3249110518077
Bloom.	1916.0088814178278
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	11122.162564453763
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	12098.711091346748
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	10403.972071259352
Every day we must do homage to her.	14190.09292431546
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	16959.275831344166
He knows your old fellow.	4531.474855418481
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	9094.920513011857
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	11472.599729500736
Venus Kallipyge.	14855.255256694101
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	10117.902429448068
— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	10268.675183011917
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	11717.864050840679
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	16375.675333192034
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	13746.777224476951
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	15500.277189037959
His life was rich.	8463.106177213733
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	13770.226153886728
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	15964.445062258359
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	15743.892649570409
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	11413.09423104223
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	15125.79438562188
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	15200.119913918932
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	13883.737066225574
Cours la Reine.	18227.54902377354
_Encore vingt sous.	16807.8688531982
Minette?	19456.598729469286
Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	17215.988293285944
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	12377.085712711852
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	12843.834892399129
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	12167.211046401362
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	13577.493834032535
Do and do.	9431.745020891402
Thing done.	15707.401234162882
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	11115.71179499103
An azured harebell like her veins.	11723.321491437953
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	17356.98505688499
He walks.	3750.728011825402
One life is all.	7091.743743348759
One body.	5689.295084807353
Do. But do.	7386.909919542522
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	17010.718138155575
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	9347.616745469186
— Whom do you suspect?	6753.184526697845
he challenged.	8579.278802260933
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	9677.42643467906
Once spurned twice spurned.	13498.003490640338
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	10478.468646706764
Love that dare not speak its name.	10571.5274677769
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	11273.864531906367
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	12244.316053539786
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	12870.529564057555
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	16179.04652823879
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	11954.798505679599
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	14570.546858216658
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	15651.117410302879
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	14440.640581436473
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	9494.171492128698
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	9325.534493792025
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	14552.39476803305
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	15526.349118235914
O, yes, mention there is.	6238.994367541744
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	13057.469915179328
Explain you then.	15175.67984183378
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	15994.172864709599
He faced their silence.	5647.376429406276
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	11797.442555593192
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	10386.210664956405
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	11472.599729500736
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	16458.009435112384
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	13439.963644518888
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	16819.419911419274
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	12864.28453721603
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	12569.750527496166
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	10519.780033964436
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	11433.061786654389
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	9590.142694673585
Let me think.	6688.984149369034
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	14897.001696856523
— Do you mean he died so?	5160.339336292672
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	7649.411013587384
I mean...	4829.170747824525
— He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	7075.81535325249
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	10916.932126969617
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! — What?	8655.62917481586
asked Besteglinton.	13656.980144780464
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	15669.322221546165
The people ’ s William.	7475.025159920183
Dowden, Highfield house...	16702.366946211594
— Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	7876.345456317607
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	10888.552263128691
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those <URL> Lovely! Catamite.	11603.814005797385
— The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	9325.50130506489
Steadfast John replied severe: — The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	17010.718138155575
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	10985.672725812503
Sayest thou so?	18227.54902377354
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	14510.97445816577
— And the sense of property, Stephen said.	4865.1180270370505
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	8923.859902643127
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	13254.280868842287
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	13651.044155317686
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	13468.486421560265
How else could Aubrey ’ s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	12946.087945741685
All events brought grist to his mill.	10933.863096708925
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	16678.480084081308
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love ’ s Labour Lost_.	11115.179523658668
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	12859.123317686288
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter ’ s theory of equivocation.	17041.351916654137
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	12981.943553260058
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’ s.	8916.453222764361
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	14894.45936057602
I think you ’ re getting on very nicely.	7825.757799320461
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	12380.524395892233
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, <URL> — Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	16591.331418514834
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	13777.83059448208
_Sufflaminandus <URL> — He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	16899.786054421136
— A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	6784.900218539206
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	17932.61452774436
_Amplius.	12971.327416137423
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter <URL> — Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	13330.924268830246
— _Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	10884.826644159857
There he keened a wailing rune.	8478.922310057596

— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	14462.281653602462
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	13470.359244698253
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	16959.24882930963
Accusations are made in anger.	17724.87334026543
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	14036.915039844454
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	16318.916210301157

When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.	15708.310448069898

Why did he take them rather than others?	8681.484648384152
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what ’ s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	15594.0111486404
Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.	16289.263798257522
The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	9983.09061494124
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare ’ s reverence, the angel of the world.	13605.398310915078
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney ’ s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?	14455.841779828173

_Que voulez - vous? _ Moore would say.	17279.93518182534
He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	10472.110899071193
— Why?	2205.3111787558055
Stephen answered himself.	8480.332369056065
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	14700.828687576732
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	14480.57130829783
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	13933.885955548609
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	14297.34196646988
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	12617.052852024779
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	10058.332797941513
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	14500.86063822577
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	13008.359080150494
Age has not withered it.	17724.87334026543
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	14933.431250771988
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	14349.455451492942
He laughed to free his mind from his mind ’ s bondage.	10183.827079588158
Judge Eglinton summed up.	16760.897092969924
— The truth is midway, he affirmed.	6247.244528011264
He is the ghost and the prince.	6671.233630655082
He is all in all.	5147.906823250853
— He is, Stephen said.	3062.7329704907293
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	10411.06146141681
All in all.	7244.370770667849
In _Cymbeline, _ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold.	12226.842461050413
He acts and is acted on.	8282.810077087443
Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen.	16609.827111563896
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	13222.80112179669
— Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.	9351.00568971699
O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	11859.919451088588
— And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	7967.857462354774
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?) _ is right.	14109.594779619398
After God Shakespeare has created most.	12161.93492434831
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	8209.116486498988
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	14519.186812608597

And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced.	13880.208326850498
If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa ’ s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	14781.020859553333

We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers - in - love, but always meeting ourselves.	14937.826379467717
The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	15635.005262523815
_ — Eureka! _ Buck Mulligan cried.	7741.357888075173
_Eureka! _ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton ’ s desk.	16264.527659546395
— May I?	4014.1416462636403
he said.	2082.9626069148076
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	8254.458994756533
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	8025.234616383704
Take some slips from the counter going out.	14013.676886595322
— Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live.	12046.401265802571
The rest shall keep as they are.	8916.453222764361
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	10237.460010701732

You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	10914.648298519243
Do you believe your own theory?	8200.079061116297
— No, Stephen said promptly.	3804.6383317458726
— Are you going to write it?	4808.235629016677
Mr Best asked.	4818.064530215714
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	9534.995821194076
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	11485.27443672835
— Well, in that case, he said, I don ’ t see why you should expect payment for it since you don ’ t believe it yourself.	10814.113234428725

— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	9660.117561169276
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	14985.73717432061
He broke away.	4763.776729214645
— Come, Kinch.	3084.879951738471
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	9605.741047731786
Come, Kinch.	6222.706694958334
You have eaten all we left.	6198.497739106827
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	13563.190910273475
Stephen rose.	7177.298625627132
Life is many days.	12616.043640326236
This will end.	9917.208811977727
— We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	7565.088698775643
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	17279.93518182534
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	8615.023012974736
— Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	11156.603095512346

I gall his kibe.	6828.996811279133
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	14000.780478051714
What have I learned?	6655.406182394938

The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	8254.458994756533
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won ’ t you wed a wife?	16362.83396872105
He spluttered to the air: — O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	12285.777392438522
We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers ’ hall.	13500.668805376152

M ’ Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	14669.566349613378
Jest on.	18679.07077551165
Know thyself.	12198.155126919923
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	16091.095232717094
I halt.	4389.602684722832
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	8239.274872544624
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	16091.095232717094
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	13735.689917855618
A laugh tripped over his lips.	8433.94953544488
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	11841.409696879202
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	14180.606724674219
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	10710.62504744311
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	12818.991921908171
One thinks of Homer.	9942.302930258702
He stopped at the stairfoot.	6213.231207037116
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	8916.453222764361
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	15053.158759935824
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	15391.511720007045
But listen.	5886.629222082507
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	14585.77663854961
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	15066.966337252346
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	15319.29453438586
Part.	14336.178182593083
The moment is now.	6121.13133314049
Where then?	7299.005733981272
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	12801.190426948095
Why?	1363.914055113649
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	12583.76635432935
My will: his will that fronts me.	12132.097985687598
Seas between.	18679.07077551165
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	9402.982318871174
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	4156.727425168884
The portico.	4122.464502427211
Here I watched the birds for augury.	12064.958012847235
Ængus of the birds.	15665.739701619705
They go, they come.	9181.88388318125
Last night I flew.	12966.423775746363

A creamfruit melon he held to me.	9507.376927886024
In. You will see.	8911.589372406368
— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	8640.371948374273
Did you see his eye?	7852.767718564145
He looked upon you to lust after you.	7593.398496662011
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	8517.708211314763
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	7849.133625131067

A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	13207.615468527372
They followed.	4968.376343508526
Speak on.	15707.401234162882
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	15509.522558030554
No birds.	6159.577739645505
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	16883.448887228955
Cease to strive.	18227.54902377354
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.	16609.827111563896

J.	363.7765778926278
reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	17010.718138155575
Five to three.	12352.082759196523
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	12380.524395892233
What was that boy ’ s name again?	8005.592845052071
Dignam.	5397.051392180722
Yes.	992.2748593504894
_Vere dignum et iustum <URL> Brother Swan was the person to see.	17115.978107251347
Mr Cunningham ’ s letter.	8623.169847037907
Yes.	992.2748593504894
Oblige him, if possible.	17724.87334026543
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	12532.64089796829
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	12719.220533858102
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	11596.88030147682
J.	363.7765778926278
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	12415.136484066335
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	8502.691310025877
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	15148.870554622208
And you, father?	6182.110621511913
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	7797.061275986295
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	8816.210328288094
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	10646.201513707158
Was that so?	9158.546770620618
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	8568.358872459923
And Mr Sheehy himself?	6939.079598784372
Still in London.	9330.473901721984
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	10781.207236647719
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	16682.90235283324
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	9791.226444295593
O, yes: a very great success.	7161.9562389597095
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	12897.891404537968
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	5739.09658787971
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	12958.164425811201
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	9644.420757675098
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	12650.891884878854
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	10885.528800493865
A zealous man, however.	8117.899790053171
Really he was.	16807.8688531982
And really did great good in his way.	9819.044839604363
Beyond a doubt.	15868.195079096857
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	10088.375622293517
Of good family too would one think it?	12833.647665740731
Welsh, were they not?	17724.87334026543
O, lest he forget.	5704.537688153335
That letter to father provincial.	9214.827279419815
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	9431.749813000664
The little house.	5442.1386306936365
Aha.	9780.093555557632
And were they good boys at school?	9267.046615300755
O.	1174.1571553791387
That was very good now.	6461.864553992102
And what was his name?	7114.570797764778
Jack Sohan.	14855.255256694101
And his name?	4924.173367086401
Ger.	19456.598729469286
Gallaher.	16997.075953601572
And the other little man?	4880.759462458626
His name was Brunny Lynam.	7959.805525315841
O, that was a very nice name to have.	8233.115310251802
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	13471.13479995889
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	8956.529313536003
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	11115.323623581191
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	8858.252415390212
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	16067.391462467906
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	11594.902588484696
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	14102.26040182738
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	11906.409059069776
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	15182.97945298251
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	8620.513182199547
A fine carriage she had.	8117.899790053171
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	12581.815316254815
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	11794.41111639386
what should he say?...	12847.950605134622
such a queenly mien.	17932.61452774436
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	12045.809849239055
The reverend T.	4368.736585389197
R.	4497.452177062942
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	17280.03022417759
The incumbent they called him.	7475.025159920183
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	10068.666960914557
But one should be charitable.	8298.845949590817
Invincible ignorance.	18679.07077551165
They acted according to their lights.	9881.954723581033
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	10668.84408427358
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	9492.966086542212
Surely, there ought to be.	17570.71474456905
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	10512.986157440577
All raised untidy caps.	8311.969521134488
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	9711.564316151713
Christian brother boys.	18227.54902377354
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	10409.427716737264
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	15837.604193424826
For aged and virtuous females.	10467.998492262444
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	10192.551823461796
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	17356.98505688499
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	14153.024896244766
And now it was an office or something.	9021.487118129824
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	13573.45045832672
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	12830.78144071873
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	11787.536616775002
In America those things were continually happening.	10693.844815858989
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	16667.347011617076
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	9954.449594733906
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	12669.362060394124
They saluted him and were saluted.	9881.954723581033
Father Conmee passed H.	6812.948640640204
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	10876.946673922246
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	12109.620516064902
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	13823.096340520086
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	16721.713448933497
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	14097.505259868445
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	8401.189602459572
J.	363.7765778926278
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	15748.584398497984
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	15426.353526632656
C.	1161.2080535937555
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	15570.54423215891
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	14817.08456823402
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	14685.997392247356
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	16236.669099375904
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	12840.253896867263
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	7732.478363726986
It was a peaceful day.	4555.393977525143
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	11680.334505577954
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	9174.384830196714
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	11758.854293732405
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	13967.677625008424
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	9711.564316151713
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	13361.305984579185
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	14877.157468502468
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	10781.081801603794
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	15675.633695847515
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	11871.33813479577
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	11766.424987180633
J.	363.7765778926278
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	15259.225803727397
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	13227.584324037
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	15145.960574472021
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	11211.34211625667
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	12735.043038438715
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	13205.639567187825
The Malahide road was quiet.	7475.025159920183
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	10854.766665942077
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	8916.453222764361
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	15052.592278576007
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	13622.420346125928
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	14599.152902270018
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	14284.082376164111
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	14134.706342097594
Who could know the truth?	9989.305463893934
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	14616.195065812746
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	11307.82191456706
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	12705.81478406191
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	13387.128312602508
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	13860.05133266944
He was humane and honoured there.	5792.3142413364285
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	11751.289041711452
It was a charming day.	4555.393977525143
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	12520.095116987566
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	11640.335609162034
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	17570.648302713715
A just and homely word.	8117.899790053171
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	11803.775371235144
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	12135.437873489916
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	12915.687376808
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	7709.805806955828
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	11304.972463287078
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	12179.377121894116
Nones.	19456.598729469286
He should have read that before lunch.	8943.670073404995
But lady Maxwell had come.	9162.5895952032
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	11304.972463287078
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	16550.404344702416
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	10755.240514461802
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	11285.678836073688
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	16731.458499012577
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	12636.503219481252
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	16609.856668520133
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	12966.104665461593
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	13555.503940107306
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	13441.187772642828
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	15738.433849729878
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	4139.6039124606905
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	3538.617341694424
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	5712.826769493326
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	14533.589534184455
— What ’ s the best news?	2258.9301350953747
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	8697.151529183811
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	15459.1699262772
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	12164.785214913369
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	9771.03212133515
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	12986.371658714115
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	12376.492951075288
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	8660.729706592907
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	14806.440147738176
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	13963.88467315198
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	8653.760922898102
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	13040.515652795793
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	10443.48659005954
It fell on the path.	9064.908611066421
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	13178.50936429965
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	12089.13470389422
— Did you put in the books?	5737.128058072642
Boody asked.	10471.917594461911
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	16375.675333192034
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	7334.516128781675
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	11071.317712145885
— Where did you try?	5293.701000949667
Boody asked.	10471.917594461911
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	6824.613287354657
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	14952.637290865337
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	8947.773864544113
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	15950.473344786498
— What ’ s in the pot?	3173.7526030909057
she asked.	15707.401234162882
— Shirts, Maggy said.	5924.69058552277
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	15910.625405124149
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	15697.375512952161
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	8872.392851107246
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	5924.69058552277
Katey asked.	14855.255256694101
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	7441.796920570539
The lacquey rang his bell.	5370.292424832508
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	11602.833450940692
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	16271.04294698232
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	16060.419876720669
Where ’ s Dilly?	5011.131132820565
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	8059.944723565591
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	16113.811119956348
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	16286.774251122388
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	12957.639936167843
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	13861.269735268976
— Put these in first, will you?	7034.567880319981
he said.	2082.9626069148076
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	3497.3840438942266
And the fruit on top.	5388.748765678433
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	5705.212692132351
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	13010.535917614561
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	14959.518372407707
H.	4950.086631348197
E.	2132.7942562045123
L.	3652.4191613411995
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	15007.013352447684
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	12214.698158140245
— Can you send them by tram?	7292.558106537128
Now?	5223.485755744552
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	12333.256494461657
— Certainly, sir.	3293.5114944990596
Is it in the city?	9137.558776019976
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	3978.8503731837077
Ten minutes.	12198.155126919923
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	8794.204909931996
— Will you write the address, sir?	7111.0188109586525
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	13348.35909309658
— Send it at once, will you?	7325.634337321651
he said.	2082.9626069148076
It ’ s for an invalid.	4143.2499487344785
— Yes, sir.	685.2426457191965
I will, sir.	3922.7915321586866
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	12881.447482535445
— What ’ s the damage?	2490.9403587972447
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	9268.978845991714
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	12137.100537479751
A young pullet.	5317.803611327117
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	7761.517548179491
he asked gallantly.	6002.3356927611385
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	12056.144439718473
— Yes, sir, she said.	1629.3915202582864
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	17215.988293285944
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	13904.778525614618
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	9590.18732697543
he asked roguishly.	6002.3356927611385
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	10409.661908988606
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	10756.562495651255
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	14242.649257079933
Palefaces.	16997.075953601572
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	15637.676580432177
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	13028.69017975364
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	12431.951658514481
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	17215.988293285944
È peccato.	18679.07077551165
Perchè la sua voce...	17570.648302713715
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	17451.623842446083
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	9514.319470387687
_Ma, dia retta a me.	16702.366946211594
Ci rifletta_.	18679.07077551165
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	13270.096261439405
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	10594.6253304104
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	9295.823276208692
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	10320.616091350055
Human eyes.	15707.401234162882
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	12319.01687721953
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	9514.385888593848
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	17570.648302713715
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	16591.26298075692
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	14335.716807940122
_Scusi, eh?	18227.54902377354
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	13525.173504088576
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	14366.995465556956
Too much mystery business in it.	10566.817273193074
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	11042.528384614914
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	16224.754514648872
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	10626.4792239117
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	13282.443043791196
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny ’ s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone ’ s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	15627.81337940612
E.	2132.7942562045123
L.	3652.4191613411995
Y. ’ S and plodded back as they had come.	14246.8453984567
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	13499.161392106505
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	17724.87334026543
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	6481.6693890609295
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	10411.083957689882
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	13288.226273816646
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	11539.438056169482
They kick out grand.	8324.989829218672
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	16627.45005880234
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	14974.406515898394
— Hello.	2052.335361935009
Yes, sir.	1491.5619158298528
No, sir.	2526.8307223348206
Yes, sir.	1491.5619158298528
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	3660.538136411075
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	13949.157040180431
All right, sir.	7134.888261010539
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	11754.245746060162
A quarter after.	6108.478345590255
Yes, sir.	1491.5619158298528
Twentyseven and six.	18227.54902377354
I ’ ll tell him.	2056.790163923135
Yes: one, seven, six.	10038.34351921486
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	10241.653246825967
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	10289.502024254145
Mr Lenehan, yes.	8277.916980094644
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	9218.164144917673
No, sir.	2526.8307223348206
Yes, sir.	1491.5619158298528
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	3660.538136411075
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	12379.645495360628
— Who ’ s that?	2754.7514493189046
Ned Lambert asked.	5007.015961106531
Is that Crotty?	6509.08804908772
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	10207.373606066014
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	5714.086566883417
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	12812.608119086584
Come on.	4221.334036659905
Mind your steps there.	15393.126810427384
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	12840.218585308325
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	13252.207905481137
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	8459.468659230117
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	3283.856166564691
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	12925.234230335667
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	10101.832601931928
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	13940.215035534775
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	10374.461220915597
— No, Ned.	2331.715436069934
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	10365.164694139963
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	3128.966740761537
That ’ s quite right, sir.	4234.413963881845
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	11422.348070204123
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	4195.992830897584
Bring the camera whenever you like.	14281.628306871207
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	6448.195478788177
You can take it from here or from here.	9764.688665110949
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	11959.708948051177
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	12540.150480002903
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	6014.920939319596
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	10009.842755908008
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	4839.793590523494
Drop in whenever you like.	13849.438419394137
Next week, say.	15393.126810427384
Can you see?	7960.619168599979
— Yes, yes.	1436.656392194662
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	10504.704652937162
Very pleased to have met you.	13659.238031252198
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	8650.555814176254
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	11622.613645639289
With J.	7431.836760265275
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	11767.51268306695
He stood to read the card in his hand.	7633.996056603575
— The reverend Hugh C.	3321.1988785931862
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	17279.93518182534
Nice young chap he is.	12039.42525721009
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	6831.187269073014
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	5174.126691224819
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	8358.825083515261
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	7425.104827319701
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Molloy said.	1803.8300168032767
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	9573.890492840583
— God! he cried.	4510.33417384916
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	12185.03737865244
You know that one?	5654.5034046443325
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	15718.521827486926
What?	694.4811020788688
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	8709.690272283202
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	8015.782216909344
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	15509.561656599442
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	10403.972071259352
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	12856.25568257272
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	6909.794581519215
What is it?	1868.65751089726
What ’ s the trouble?	4025.1846584616724
Wait awhile.	6929.420956192861
Hold hard.	8806.064324091374
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	14086.252718407279
— Chow! he said.	5772.393706663396
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	16124.289314517251
J.	363.7765778926278
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	6687.7441741869425
cold night before...	17724.87334026543
blast your soul...	16727.42622563514
night before last...	17724.87334026543
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	14822.285494913393
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	8816.170571001065
— I was...	2650.582950891551
Glasnevin this morning...	17724.87334026543
poor little...	17932.61452774436
what do you call him...	14766.285882287826
Chow!...	14553.80505675568
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	15843.964836612815
— See?	1854.3821826508365
he said.	2082.9626069148076
Say it ’ s turn six.	12331.32044560232
In here, see.	8039.782698742574
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	14634.21472942052
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	11176.398265462967
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	16176.254985175703
— See?	1854.3821826508365
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	13778.945200072658
The impact.	4122.464502427211
Leverage, see?	18227.54902377354
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	10242.93864372042
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	7381.159498358845
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	14025.534213862475
— See?	1854.3821826508365
Tom Rochford said.	9429.579047337722
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	12621.482017365712
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	15000.565072737358
One good turn deserves another.	10691.049044173882
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	5002.744276105227
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	11966.397294278795
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	7384.818687884915
When you two begin...	10210.65464889659
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	13166.018874564428
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	7585.264393949312
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	5366.24840199673
See you later.	10014.333916917605
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	4763.373747035571
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	2029.246403723103
The drain, you mean.	7475.025159920183
— Drain?	3451.237535283804
Lenehan said.	6465.085575462731
It was down a manhole.	5811.324839940247
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	12786.281205130284
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	15896.008014247009
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	13040.174900320337
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	15909.181475152967
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	13000.159471550947
— The act of a hero, he said.	4704.850345721233
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	12897.34749185692
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	8594.282042554116
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	10023.896882601404
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	7488.019597589947
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	12388.498178854768
— After three, he said.	4006.087017780456
Who ’ s riding her?	6011.726033367645
— O.	1559.8147553833028
Madden, Lenehan said.	10673.536103604576
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	15350.704557057912
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	14948.475999144672
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	11388.05554503291
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	8239.274872544624
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	13251.177018119373
Through here.	12492.20319340747
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	10867.877129552578
— There he is, Lenehan said.	3622.5205554503423
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	10289.849847769361
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	10884.826644159857
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	4835.777402649519
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	11216.44090994924
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	13659.377961236833
Astronomy it was about.	17932.61452774436
Lenehan laughed.	9416.023915768359
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	5558.542844251617
Come over in the sun.	9414.163998548294
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	12780.021426873534
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	14011.723501893124
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	8255.182288680626
The annual dinner, you know.	7195.4013990903695
Boiled shirt affair.	18227.54902377354
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	13235.205503069774
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	15039.778534931225
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	3872.0980648310915
My missus sang there once.	10028.395122690541
— Did she?	2994.0189534625833
Lenehan said.	6465.085575462731
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	11861.112493233015
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	11433.984092194223
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	3645.334310420094
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	17076.136894926323
Bloom and the wife were there.	10471.43879640761
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	16917.697281476372
Fast and furious it was.	17724.87334026543
After liquids came solids.	10979.859907691622
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	15313.485572694599
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	2029.246403723103
The year the missus was there...	8745.392952031963
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	11983.678814540122
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	3645.334310420094
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	14133.903603204297
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	15410.793038171565
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	13744.835674808519
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	13331.005220201976
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	11259.315811769413
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	14930.130176133842
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	15758.10165000074
Like that.	4824.920605851159
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	12099.265022644091
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	12621.482017365712
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	8185.72418541111
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	6801.992730029247
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	15103.033461594374
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	10395.162249775623
He knows them all, faith.	6863.373501607028
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	15771.424473440748
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	9430.809204149373
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	16250.844317880219
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	14073.600941007211
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	3628.552566756502
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	11259.922019441658
Lenehan walked on again.	11358.434291790916
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	7963.389968564846
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	8816.126133874757
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	6668.018157540303
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	6636.22434401269
you know...	16760.897092969924
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	7199.863779398694
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	14011.96702398181
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	17010.718138155575
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	14933.867971192976
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	10442.399618526179
Child born every minute somewhere.	16727.42622563514
Mrs Purefoy.	10144.946496005443
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	12331.84650117213
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	7691.235843363255
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	9027.20808310735
— Them are two good ones, he said.	6688.204681414493
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	16620.801477775938
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	12738.775473737438
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	12655.540198574217
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	6681.592035388911
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	17724.87334026543
Know the kind that is.	13112.33131626797
Had it?	10144.946496005443
Yes.	992.2748593504894
He opened it.	5045.875357055062
Thought so.	10076.107742163176
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	8209.70973977337
Listen: the man.	12817.985451740484
Got her it once.	11003.460012239257
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	8722.289943375083
More in her line.	12553.74482835707
Let us see.	7154.433752502506
He read where his finger opened.	7220.11500147173
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	11070.222168122575
This.	5384.0915161455
Here.	2362.0757772639918
Try.	11379.205787978168
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	12864.194809884835
Take this.	10940.817986651611
The end.	3725.095356282331
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	9308.322299605561
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	11869.272536447394
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	13919.879942387639
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	10838.457826028736
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	17115.978107251347
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	10004.661937286033
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	15691.759192840798
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	17932.61452774436
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	16654.630702959523
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	16261.443583121036
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	17041.41635604723
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	11681.101320168522
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	9811.431323648321
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	12726.413058775688
Mr Bloom beheld it.	4344.299241510347
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	14406.436368297083
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	8849.007850220893
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	10564.900199307682
That ’ s a good one.	2959.6451767402286
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	16096.061435008738
Four and nine.	13492.86464334258
Those lovely curtains.	10314.026557980322
Five shillings.	11484.713480619906
Cosy curtains.	16878.573427268955
Selling new at two guineas.	16053.975985553223
Any advance on five shillings?	14084.625240398014
Going for five shillings.	13303.535250527691
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	12796.539051571674
J.	363.7765778926278
A.	707.4051198927579
Jackson, W.	16807.8688531982
E.	2132.7942562045123
Munro and H.	18227.54902377354
T.	3538.2054799403722
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	17041.351916654137
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	10275.781079642178
He halted near his daughter.	6274.799479235303
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	4613.681543851011
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	7878.4652139138825
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	12941.35315450893
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	17451.623842446083
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	9660.576932778293
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	5833.529213537727
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	7035.421972962772
Do you know what you look like?	5852.058687654473
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	11774.553323216514
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	6761.022376837948
All the people are looking at you.	8678.621195043961
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	9660.576932778293
— Did you get any money?	5026.362699236893
Dilly asked.	14193.453893600445
— Where would I get money?	6103.332353539268
Mr Dedalus said.	1557.9361486882747
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	10840.547341059422
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	7526.344138686103
— How do you know that?	4207.878531417566
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	7818.891179839337
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	10537.979578771563
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	4791.9950616714605
Were you in the Scotch house now?	12348.612257154016
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	12987.288396830147
Here.	2362.0757772639918
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	7143.827006833647
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	5545.103190312726
Give me more than that.	10562.815437289391
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	8060.846429312082
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	7915.9446742205155
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	13378.998629299494
But wait awhile.	6299.943613588103
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	9940.170663521692
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	15060.298016348446
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	11242.705720675067
He ’ s dead.	2103.1305412599
The man upstairs is dead.	5787.179598073279
He left her and walked on.	7873.501926046016
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	15446.433163739166
— Well, what is it?	3273.3745667759586
he said, stopping.	7549.003157158634
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	7524.27475060544
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	11388.753576940466
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	12918.389358637367
— Watch him, he said.	3889.8298649324815
It ’ s instructive.	2612.450539175188
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	6735.38060305034
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	4589.949447081784
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	6448.165469175534
Look, there ’ s all I have.	13285.75024519775
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	11487.244033106088
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	9394.169104228959
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	9255.297136298646
Dilly said.	14193.453893600445
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	6096.808741469593
— I will, he said gravely.	4110.175056535143
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	9490.018520783768
I ’ ll try this one now.	4243.794422935918
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	6385.826337675083
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	7404.892194034649
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	13651.114821112556
I ’ ll be home shortly.	3403.6858042006343
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	10146.791022208234
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	11108.741518187659
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	5026.048683570454
The lacquey banged loudly.	5453.3905385530425
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	14214.521106135562
Got round him all right.	12357.336220593894
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	5857.71287891597
First rate, sir.	12026.020676764052
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	9628.009045815437
How are things going?	6368.709593744214
Just keeping alive.	9825.485728073067
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	14369.103464748194
Yes, indeed.	3311.805856131721
Good for the country.	10421.353401935503
Those farmers are always grumbling.	12505.304740148655
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	7082.8741988877955
Yes, sir.	1491.5619158298528
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	15669.322221546165
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	15762.484269390725
And heartrending scenes.	6326.0672817923205
Men trampling down women and children.	15316.311760780676
Most brutal thing.	12738.676159755245
What do they say was the cause?	7205.206347077779
Spontaneous combustion.	18679.07077551165
Most scandalous revelation.	12738.676159755245
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	11469.564277972502
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	12647.35507937591
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	12099.146017131365
You know why?	4948.173593226032
Palm oil.	18679.07077551165
Is that a fact?	5434.2793013202145
Without a doubt.	18227.54902377354
Well now, look at that.	11613.411424843982
And America they say is the land of the free.	10709.462033340222
I thought we were bad here.	7596.0039864657265
I smiled at him.	6382.790006721143
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	17215.988293285944
_What is it?	16807.8688531982
The sweepings of every country including our own.	9484.074403340821
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	11802.149910806016
Graft, my dear sir.	17724.87334026543
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	12181.82597909539
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	14559.432007504494
Dress does it.	15868.195079096857
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	13566.671310138481
Bowls them over.	18227.54902377354
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	3636.2468215124513
How are things?	4474.90477756321
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	6047.591406290518
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	11779.385560110755
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	16702.366946211594
Scott of Dawson street.	17932.61452774436
Never built under three guineas.	11730.65542103653
Fits me down to the ground.	15316.369671053932
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	13858.798230335839
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	15243.744244596748
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	16051.953953143342
Knight of the road.	17932.61452774436
Gentleman.	19456.598729469286
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	11764.181789083732
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	11680.312421563716
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	15682.411162885843
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	9292.964334804103
High colour, of course.	11955.492124842303
Grizzled moustache.	18679.07077551165
Returned Indian officer.	16807.8688531982
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	17041.351916654137
Is that Ned Lambert ’ s brother over the way, Sam?	11849.179732138957
What?	694.4811020788688
Yes.	992.2748593504894
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	5174.155149732701
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	9103.098049314178
Damn like him.	12738.676159755245
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	16177.542333353207
Good drop of gin, that was.	12153.168439876845
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	11827.012255721593
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	15420.148054823485
Greasy black rope.	16807.8688531982
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant ’ s wife drove by in her noddy.	16195.471723464063
Bad times those were.	13127.503305506403
Well, well.	4075.3375444637586
Over and done with.	13044.992494478589
Great topers too.	13492.86464334258
Fourbottle men.	18679.07077551165
Let me see.	3722.0165921837556
Is he buried in saint Michan ’ s?	11044.883984459875
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	12503.86487981545
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	16249.81104549519
Dignam is there now.	12818.243863230015
Went out in a puff.	16727.42622563514
Well, well.	4075.3375444637586
Better turn down here.	11131.22160100128
Make a detour.	10063.771365826717
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	15615.392339572698
Damn dangerous thing.	12738.676159755245
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	14082.496063388331
Runaway horse.	18679.07077551165
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton ’ s office, led his wife over O ’ Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	15617.3627698004
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	7260.777243405093
Times of the troubles.	17932.61452774436
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	12990.855945411438
Gaming at Daly ’ s.	16727.42622563514
No cardsharping then.	7503.861566893145
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	11244.69969497108
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	15420.105647741242
Stables behind Moira house.	17932.61452774436
Damn good gin that was.	13722.6327910196
Fine dashing young nobleman.	14553.805056755707
Good stock, of course.	9307.330110028888
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	12800.037726503133
Course they were on the wrong side.	13804.595416060436
They rose in dark and evil days.	10463.152996270252
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	15024.066288223417
They were gentlemen.	5072.387402806892
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	11462.083283061145
Masterly rendition.	18679.07077551165
_At the siege of Ross did my father <URL> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	15322.064159395695
Frockcoats.	19456.598729469286
Cream sunshades.	16878.573427268955
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	8717.042341938579
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	11806.968084893093
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	15550.270966077278
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	15762.484269390725
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	15898.98236476088
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	16224.119686091273
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	16076.67622742276
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	12278.496114664777
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	17076.136894926323
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	11502.162947363016
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	11861.08857236919
A long and seafed silent rut.	8433.94953544488
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	13465.796051225587
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	15122.325157157013
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	17451.623842446083

Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.	15471.086108684876
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	14903.975095081385
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	12520.095116987566
Beingless beings.	18679.07077551165
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	14493.569205669259
Your heart you sing of.	11417.474848068117
I between them.	5722.479309358666
Where?	1683.5310292764207
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	15420.105647741242
Shatter them, one and both.	16702.366946211594
But stun myself too in the blow.	10446.048253726409
Shatter me you who can.	16727.42622563514
Bawd and butcher were the words.	17570.648302713715
I say! Not yet awhile.	7596.0039864657265
A look around.	6108.478345590255
Yes, quite true.	5302.312976986495
You say right, sir.	8090.174061801639
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	13582.597295380632
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	13294.677928066496
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	17215.988293285944
The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	11413.09423104223
And they are throbbing: heroes ’ hearts.	8027.497762160996
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	7304.787146274224
— Twopence each, the huckster said.	7876.345456317607

Stephen said.	4036.2442405669176
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	11861.08857236919
It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	11960.763699783416

_Nebrakada <URL> — What have you there?	17451.623842446083
Stephen asked.	2565.8259170644847
— I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.	9505.980534582122
Is it any good?	8278.122142547034

— What did you buy that for?	5597.4965049427965
he asked.	1701.5994383257973

She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	11172.774148947972

Quite natural.	11699.385526317174

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	12432.105808227116
How are things?	4474.90477756321
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	6047.591406290518
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	11730.107923515714
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	12457.132246722285
— What ’ s the best news?	2258.9301350953747
Mr Dedalus said.	1557.9361486882747
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	6327.353652766696
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	9364.701927677359
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	4131.257973015299
Who is it?	6419.540325473256
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	9507.376927886024
— With a broken back, is it?	7111.040319449105
Mr Dedalus asked.	2052.187388741324
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	6279.6072586840755
Reuben of that ilk.	15976.304393411037
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	8844.470560911479
All I want is a little time.	10452.240549557622
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	11202.859903506129
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	3803.42903269668
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	14060.9897523099
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	15032.152381651264
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	7398.3268324846385
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	13463.71405413752
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	10343.230741291625
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	12364.052131429551
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	6589.276935160681
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	10961.792380550643
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	13136.545546612007
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	11796.606678216742
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	13799.223832823336
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	9263.03788053411
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	13228.365969798
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	6460.555332192148
Father Cowley asked.	8593.05328764482
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	11636.161034194329
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	14018.141067267728
— Aw! he said.	5772.393706663396
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	6045.604849885139
— What about that?	2613.469734064521
Ben Dollard said.	6865.693680465813
Not too dusty?	7963.023390395647
What?	694.4811020788688
He turned to both.	3529.292248608428
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	6045.502782175864
The reverend Hugh C.	4541.015247090467
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	12973.17176530705
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	7174.549069244764
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	9377.32054697867
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	4682.50146901295
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	5174.140920674418
Come along.	7099.087200834589
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	12653.980965983523
Wait awhile...	9258.445295085592
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	10073.091847837566
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	9295.983949668844
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	15155.595304027178
— What few days?	3257.471273655096
he boomed.	8579.278802260933
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	15369.18552991545
— He has, Father Cowley said.	4107.416436125815
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	10920.049622135917
The landlord has the prior claim.	6739.839490095106
I gave him all the particulars.	7220.662748093203
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	11285.01848033392
Love is the name?	11852.99849689722
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	3128.9581375848993
The reverend Mr Love.	5453.3905385530425
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	4682.50146901295
But are you sure of that?	9863.782630541877
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	11005.823918169293
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	10803.853923993442
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	11776.114794386232
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	12321.29136294718
The policeman touched his forehead.	7475.025159920183
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	7565.508114471609
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	12537.278225907834
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	12784.291245711333
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	4873.282951195168
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	10993.359043553544
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	7800.971231379468
— Boyd?	3451.237535283804
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	6611.54478385835
Touch me not.	12182.59111938178
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	13520.950514370286
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	11924.2708612303
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	9975.267020722324
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	10749.049988478624
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	8787.891613684298
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	7961.751262176991
And put down the five shillings too.	9694.057319299502
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	7274.606379847005
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	8145.289014482254
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	10004.282798734086
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	7529.139272487454
They went down Parliament street.	8055.432334920587
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	8490.033718637076
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	4249.2337550978555
Here goes.	6646.842042275948
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	15122.037386586158
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	15020.714048691101
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	10620.935812989286
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	11418.37073594551
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	10781.081801603794
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	12712.67831250153
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	9859.408002166678
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	11413.117248412982
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	7992.423726533245
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	11761.95844218188
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	11867.224867470402
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	7698.100972225453
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	11158.405715702926
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	15909.15741155057
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	12856.313386764417
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	14683.285104713384
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	15837.412554638748
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	12331.876564879914
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	13354.90166826001
— What Dignam was that?	4108.122735159479
long John Fanning asked.	17932.61452774436
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	17215.988293285944
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	5387.215899470124
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	13441.4426900563
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	16577.632543400265
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	7082.526949254587
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	12359.28489538982
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	12891.418084651998
— Rather lowsized.	4720.890658155755
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	10670.308011943363
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	11325.672817276723
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	16682.902352833207
— What ’ s that?	1070.5066707719686
Martin Cunningham said.	3171.8546015714915
All turned where they stood.	9716.350077818355
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	10004.282798734086
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	13439.865147444889
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	16627.414130203724
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	12226.842461050413
— What was it?	2902.106245588953
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	9645.507545523431
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	9290.450966097336
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	13262.756626033277
There in the corner.	8666.210423557883
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	13794.229528796934
— Is that he?	2936.4836796437035
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	12632.365626765599
— Yes, Mulligan said.	2382.648310559866
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	7568.602873968495
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	14510.125950235888
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	14406.609115135445
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	5875.453027723932
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	6222.599584824193
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	11728.996069745788
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	14322.928428749914
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	10060.51873068663
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	2410.0346042494016
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	15870.296748191544
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	12338.421226245811
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	8890.600630921972
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	9533.952083017566
Wandering Ængus I call him.	16727.42622563514
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	10068.39772277012
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	11870.65984730052
Such persons always have.	13714.062609733974
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	7872.77737188455
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	9775.246036491404
He will never capture the Attic note.	8549.71295838215
That is his tragedy.	5796.6866420139295
He can never be a poet.	7873.501926046016
The joy of creation...	7846.551857257705
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	9351.1856893322
I see.	1944.1267170399663
I tackled him this morning on belief.	9168.77625240336
There was something on his mind, I saw.	9926.864688022066
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	8899.71803012792
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	8442.874528436365
He helped her to unload her tray.	8943.670073404995
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	10616.931776749598
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	11413.09423104223
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	15420.105647741242
Does he write anything for your movement?	14515.329583120745
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	11136.978707189392
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	11706.199103844683
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	8943.670073404995
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	9256.532769290627
He is going to write something in ten years.	7867.651007217116
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	10893.308564868927
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	11354.363933007015
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	10803.853923993442
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	10287.015083461849
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	4202.761005718383
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	15870.976032720544
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	12088.85508850742
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	13434.943096786106
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	17010.748408491785
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	13581.164859675177
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	14445.910222134396
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	9204.112561579812
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	14292.454678990613
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	14569.862435603272
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	9525.778324832969
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	13924.53039202955
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	13921.747951172556
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	11317.69317382217
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	14177.886317417997
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	10525.37622455262
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	11805.703079914361
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	15489.658576102373
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	11928.286926440425
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	8005.8643374356025
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	14478.493471879105
That ’ s me in mourning.	4213.217905252838
When is it?	9825.485728073067
May the twentysecond.	13492.86464334258
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	14189.921283120013
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	11048.412419786675
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	15689.154034844687
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	13854.648561530314
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	14478.493471879105
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	8653.760922898102
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	14294.016168493268
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	12524.094004961842
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	14432.719550778731
No Sandymount tram.	7503.861566893145
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	15090.066898299216
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	11434.096944762483
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	12338.421226245811
He met schoolboys with satchels.	7082.073948416487
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	5861.6514062354545
He met other schoolboys.	6149.179198239481
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	11186.664704041956
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	16627.485987478653
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	12596.666050080144
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	13943.383381881473
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	13235.189487826196
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	16583.598455514977
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	10916.959647895632
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	13801.054874659443
Never see him again.	8622.796480626252
Death, that is.	14932.487582743664
Pa is dead.	16807.8688531982
My father is dead.	9227.129711445195
He told me to be a good son to ma.	9340.313185541074
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	11977.017827430902
Poor pa.	9201.27671397392
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	7961.4826205146255
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	11952.113135665482
* * * William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge.	12934.903175335348

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.	13235.189487826196
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis.	10797.904268943506
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar.	13838.880945256255
Between Queen ’ s and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley ’ s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B.	16031.043921549146

A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M.	8613.337314807264
E.	2132.7942562045123
White ’ s, the pawnbroker ’ s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.	16148.198850269586
In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	11300.649536245543
Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King ’ s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty.	16687.374398447955
From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan ’ s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage.	14859.291711263508

His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus ’ greeting.	10320.616091350055
From Cahill ’ s corner the reverend Hugh C.	12067.126556462761
Love, M.	9654.928686367944
A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	11245.121863102662
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	16283.419838333006
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	15810.64968598074
The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	9187.597597094822
C.	1161.2080535937555

O., passed Micky Anderson ’ s all times ticking watches and Henry and James ’ s wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_ James.	13382.787170554204
Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade.	15203.593724484666
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	15180.714673956281
A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	13271.239912031098
G.	9227.897710055386
Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A.	14828.30448316611

Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently.	14043.628699635401
In Fownes ’ s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal ’ s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	14565.461339767677
John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it.	14355.269136404038
Where the foreleg of King Billy ’ s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders.	14233.16496644915
She shouted in his ear the tidings.	10241.653246825967
Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage.	17010.718138155575
The honourable Gerald Ward A.	5787.05458242236
C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply.	9292.212376204441
At Ponsonby ’ s corner a jaded white flagon H.	13043.511621333431
halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, <URL>. ’ S, while outriders pranced past and carriages.	16883.448887228955

By the provost ’ s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl ’ s a Yorkshire <URL> Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders ’ skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge.	15157.126980887391
His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips.	13732.912908236305
As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park.	14596.9077583544
Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cortège_: But though she ’ s a factory lass And wears no fancy clothes.	14251.80101319059
Baraabum.	10295.660825818126

Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	15665.099996015122
— Is that her?	2936.4836796437035
asked miss Kennedy.	14188.216383417554
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	14031.152481528636
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	13811.770267519032
— Who?	710.3041491697493
Where?	1683.5310292764207
gold asked more eagerly.	17932.61452774436
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	9802.365338257458
He ’ s looking.	2103.1199375700608
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	13812.632768214515
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	13214.553189249864
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	12402.551475269118
With sadness.	7431.836760265275
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	13332.284782490116
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	17115.978107251347
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	16271.04294698232
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	7450.636358078727
A man.	3043.3804751541893
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	16721.72549304518
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	11413.09423104223
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	7876.865432959105
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	13889.256716447788
— What is it?	1285.7135923413941
loud boots unmannerly asked.	17932.61452774436
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	10207.373606066014
— Your _beau, _ is it?	7441.796920570539
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	13541.100632517831
Bloom.	1916.0088814178278
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	13261.97875648267
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	12187.72427132597
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	17932.61452774436
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	8059.944723565591
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	11842.496025824117
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	13108.640749914543
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	13752.587448605125
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	12584.578218445771
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	6014.514581431308
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	12159.041578720957
It gets brown after.	8201.386601223077
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	11344.152124327544
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	5836.300532317103
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	9805.546867595524
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	16899.786054421136
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	11077.831047269065
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	13757.509872513081
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	15802.380317054405
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	5679.757270009846
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	5344.546872136134
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	12163.951061658941
says he.	3811.5863753148074
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	14668.561923407566
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	11115.179523658668
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	13010.535917614561
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	11481.1455573291
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	17010.748408491785
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	13165.341533584875
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	6173.814552641794
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	12017.10889181722
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	13819.835869793287
Why do I always think Figather?	9507.114810704663
Gathering figs, I think.	13894.212333769912
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	9694.057319299502
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	13500.466748019315
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	17356.98505688499
God they believe she is: or goddess.	13114.948946120245
Those today.	10144.946496005443
I could not see.	4615.164173115993
That fellow spoke.	6350.246528541105
A student.	4762.787687825449
After with Dedalus ’ son.	10985.442826006669
He might be Mulligan.	5478.35110651109
All comely virgins.	7856.268068370497
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	11754.610190537924
By went his eyes.	9966.473182064097
The sweets of sin.	4671.36813518706
Sweet are the sweets.	12714.047989740055
Of sin.	8781.017118191983
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	11658.738952328624
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	14409.649712936514
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	12509.58341150286
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	13154.43953776264
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	16148.137795163895
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	14453.12216285801
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	9351.00568971699
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	16748.064491463207
And then laughed more.	5306.805118497492
Greasy I knows.	16807.8688531982
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	16917.697281476372
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	13022.251921019893
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	15669.322221546165
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	9160.81906166214
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	10205.752879107577
I feel all wet.	5066.253636256257
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	5387.215899470124
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	13172.502141867815
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	14200.925977650792
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	15512.491173523409
Religion pays.	18679.07077551165
Must see him for that par.	10875.675871721098
Eat first.	12825.524320071201
I want.	2698.9206119339547
Not yet.	4365.686889019613
At four, she said.	6526.872657046458
Time ever passing.	11090.4665007323
Clockhands turning.	18679.07077551165
On. Where eat?	8534.345594524211
The Clarence, Dolphin.	6549.046155587141
On. For Raoul.	8534.345594524211
Eat.	11785.827218061331
If I net five guineas with those ads.	9661.939842762478
The violet silk petticoats.	6549.046155587141
Not yet.	4365.686889019613
The sweets of sin.	4671.36813518706
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	17356.98505688499
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	16112.477388603033
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	14195.660629708114
He strolled.	3301.1096734088446
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	4815.91472670559
He held her hand.	5031.367238600912
Enjoyed her holidays?	18227.54902377354
— Tiptop.	2817.966270688388
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	9510.124958484019
— Gorgeous, she said.	4681.864935491637
Lying out on the strand all day.	16682.90235283324
Bronze whiteness.	12825.524320071201
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	9644.861483936576
Tempting poor simple males.	16760.897092969924
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	10974.925747971067
— O go away! she said.	5228.632446038772
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	6462.2762267408325
He was.	2029.9433851880942
— Well now I am, he mused.	6563.7419054977045
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	10769.788019179501
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	7995.879705805086
And what did the doctor order today?	8975.542868347553
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	8122.820323123469
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	10559.982778916139
Jingle.	8172.165736889734
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	8603.705568870319
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	13019.026736571897
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	12999.161063116335
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	17076.136894926323
Alacrity she served.	18227.54902377354
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	9510.124958484019
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	10047.04543054301
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	9828.034795991929
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	9431.627896029271
Yes.	992.2748593504894
Yes.	992.2748593504894
Yes.	992.2748593504894
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	12356.24689288475
Chips.	15443.024084639697
Shreds.	19456.598729469286
Musing.	19456.598729469286
Mute.	19456.598729469286
None nought said nothing.	15393.126810427384
Yes.	992.2748593504894
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	16575.935888962358
In came Lenehan.	6960.639023770248
Round him peered Lenehan.	13498.003490640338
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	5257.990705953329
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	8355.578674923709
To Martha I must write.	10310.17917553268
Buy paper.	14855.255256694101
Daly ’ s.	16807.8688531982
Girl there civil.	13814.400447318581
Bloom.	1916.0088814178278
Old Bloom.	6692.476931739005
Blue bloom is on the rye.	12505.905343220193
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	7167.993351298999
Lenehan came forward.	10537.512508412203
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	7168.764029875147
He asked.	3301.1096734088446
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	12526.34610595532
She asked.	4734.851276867728
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	15166.676908306128
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	13469.91199397477
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	8372.357484885919
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	11894.0707193111
To mind her stops.	9530.31373028954
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	13053.989482652585
Jingle jaunty jingle.	11746.505137760007
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	16682.902352833207
Take no notice.	11881.845346194097
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	13425.279903385921
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	16588.441933508395
He droned in vain.	6579.054785218161
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	10486.82343271636
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	12460.448900576182
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	9805.546867595524
— Who may he be?	3417.776611555236
Mr Dedalus asked.	2052.187388741324
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	11983.678814540122
Who?	4459.212751717798
— Who may he be?	3417.776611555236
he asked.	1701.5994383257973
Can you ask?	7960.619168599979
Dry.	19456.598729469286
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	9280.793329601427
— I see, he said.	2024.3238396291479
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	6566.107247528959
I hear he is keeping very select company.	8367.393858419984
Have you seen him lately?	8489.194489749625
He had.	2508.4905942595024
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	8202.299063345652
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	12810.046538244364
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	14039.265981643231
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	14148.206384804455
I see.	1944.1267170399663
He see.	4150.831484335753
He drank.	2935.2142678347846
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	10467.998492262444
Set down his glass.	16760.897092969924
— I see you have moved the piano.	5177.09789694869
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	11527.285386805757
— Is that a fact?	2239.668328224125
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	8833.309282559494
The real classical, you know.	7195.4013990903695
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	11947.236729711607
— Is that a fact?	2239.668328224125
Mr Dedalus said.	1557.9361486882747
He drank and strayed away.	6156.262994553694
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	9488.816631899515
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	10298.99909543398
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	16644.041190546446
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	13528.017122675583
Lager for diner.	16807.8688531982
Lager without alacrity she served.	16727.42622563514
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	13355.306710030074
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	16830.3113653921
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	14175.688802568591
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	14104.869016195367
Are you not happy in your home?	6491.397210563982
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	17279.93518182534
Means something, language of flow.	17570.648302713715
Was it a daisy?	9162.58082421662
Innocence that is.	15868.195079096857
Respectable girl meet after mass.	16727.42622563514
Thanks awfully muchly.	12352.082759196523
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	16342.016510695657
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	15245.551398172447
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	15393.126810427384
For some man.	8720.090461897724
For Raoul.	7431.836760265275
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	11887.373796433734
It is.	2059.323762131058
Again.	10295.660825818126
Coincidence.	9031.408469903961
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	16031.724873860056
Follow.	16997.075953601572
Risk it.	18679.07077551165
Go quick.	10940.817986651611
At four.	5040.033912722367
Near now.	11484.713480619906
Out.	5690.29118711202
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	9479.93176877448
— Aha...	5817.3251072490575
I was forgetting...	5191.901157838155
Excuse...	14188.216383417554
— And four.	2461.277345531755
At four she.	5893.525996503646
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	17724.87334026543
Bloo smi qui go.	15393.126810427384
Ternoon.	19456.598729469286
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	13859.49260009687
For men.	7431.836760265275
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	11169.726011532832
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	10928.72550710952
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	10232.074336608117
A call again.	6108.478345590255
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	10244.846246954003
You hear?	5953.004156211493
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	12708.5330223187
Longer in dying call.	17932.61452774436
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	15792.750954445346
— _The bright stars fade_...	7876.345456317607
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	10709.189346246876
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	17010.718138155575
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	16717.194562448527
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	7179.394409205818
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	13476.666699987254
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	7639.858851924817
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	13671.77660667131
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	12897.348208142483
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	7034.567880319981
he asked her.	5534.83471668172
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	12720.824403736851
Like lady, ladylike.	10489.593069935356
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	10914.079083115823
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	8568.253816800969
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	14359.261888094537
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	15090.095429150118
See me he might.	10886.50411349874
The seat he sat on: warm.	8916.453222764361
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	15622.250540187395
— _And I from thee_...	7876.345456317607
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	6655.678602432771
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	10819.081209577245
She smiled on him.	8062.04001836782
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	13444.652441771144
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	15976.304393411037
— What ’ s your cry?	2490.930940701442
Glass of bitter?	12903.77873044542
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	15027.019287771285
Not yet.	4365.686889019613
At four she.	5893.525996503646
Who said four?	8856.801548293877
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	14880.633731587946
Avoid.	19456.598729469286
Goulding a chance.	15175.67984183378
What is he doing in the Ormond?	7010.44966748602
Car waiting.	16878.573427268955
Wait.	1374.254002664509
Hello.	4249.911687445489
Where off to?	8595.180961753482
Something to eat?	9737.402576286491
I too was just.	5861.92346583866
In here.	5607.332558951055
What, Ormond?	5187.344194954393
Best value in Dublin.	9554.03173107333
Is that so?	6002.117900782751
Diningroom.	19456.598729469286
Sit tight there.	13083.145732991728
See, not be seen.	10466.2827082783
I think I ’ ll join you.	6419.314608330525
Come on.	4221.334036659905
Richie led on.	13492.86464334258
Bloom followed bag.	8635.62183246531
Dinner fit for a prince.	16727.42622563514
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	14119.798247343539
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	8179.8791588660715
— Why don ’ t you grow?	6252.362798925778
asked Blazes Boylan.	10257.999622921327
That is to say she.	6353.771458683909
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	17724.87334026543
He pitched a broad coin down.	8282.810077087443
Coin rang.	12452.996386040257
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	7839.285113628723
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	9164.852215709492
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	7211.940215053305
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	7364.149026038885
Not on my own, you know.	9320.908846236933
Fancy of a friend of mine.	15316.31176954029
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	15405.558302442767
Idolores.	19456.598729469286
The eastern seas.	5442.1386306936365
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	13492.386971453763
Clock clacked.	9339.959189702
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	12336.92536493127
It clanged.	5777.244854897311
Clock clacked.	9339.959189702
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	16601.194688851698
Look to the west.	10734.826347864153
A clack.	4762.787687825449
For me.	6249.499415855728
— What time is that?	4108.140488882481
asked Blazes Boylan.	10257.999622921327
Four?	11785.827218061331
O ’ clock.	3763.4198639699316
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	14107.779566192177
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	6306.86268105268
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	11030.36230476732
Be near.	9746.02789054866
At four.	5040.033912722367
Has he forgotten?	9654.520039335654
Perhaps a trick.	12182.885842249987
Not come: whet appetite.	10395.469249408516
I couldn ’ t do.	5232.133857973895
Wait, wait.	8441.742902366906
Pat, waiter, waited.	10647.834647336776
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	17162.064257603583
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	5383.9491564748405
There ’ s no - one.	3312.523344331118
He never heard.	4763.776729214645
—...	1960.4740354311734
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	16959.24882930963
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	16959.410829910263
— Please, please.	5817.3251072490575
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	8943.670073404995
— _I could not leave thee_...	8482.313328560254
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	8239.274872544624
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	4685.486622306884
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	13834.035929952282
She looked.	4477.979728904703
Quick.	7721.979191697367
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	12159.041578720957
Sudden bent.	18679.07077551165
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	12047.101349680637
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	16868.487024965427
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	11344.046050394205
Delayed.	19456.598729469286
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	17162.064257603583
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	6737.148515256075
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	13589.211088310489
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	8833.309282559494
Trained by owner.	12738.290905111193
No sawdust there.	7503.861566893145
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	13912.148959320768
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	7249.072536021411
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	16727.42622563514
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	16899.786054421136
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	15174.377247237915
Yes, bronze from anearby.	5555.123841104297
—...	1960.4740354311734
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	15836.757407986268
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	10081.350791858324
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	9084.759543176062
I wanted to tell you.	6156.743548001084
Tom Rochford...	11077.965088059156
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	7686.062065918684
Lenehan gulped to go.	11358.434291790916
— Got the horn or what?	7552.619014829941
he said.	2082.9626069148076
Wait.	1374.254002664509
I ’ m coming.	2058.5499828515963
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	4576.325208674294
— Eh?	2546.31996829899
How do?	3748.2686821530006
How do?	3748.2686821530006
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	12619.499003871144
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	9422.658859278927
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	17356.98505688499
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	11512.867068523032
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	17076.136894926323
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	9805.546867595524
Come on, Simon.	6524.07392289579
Give us a ditty.	7918.97507325017
We heard the piano.	9316.809644546893
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	13455.891763536245
Power for Richie.	15868.195079096857
And Bloom?	3637.9907673953335
Let me see.	3722.0165921837556
Not make him walk twice.	10395.469249408516
His corns.	6055.98139396054
Four now.	12825.524320071201
How warm this black is.	10140.440047124792
Course nerves a bit.	13498.003490640338
Refracts (is it?) heat.	17451.682501789175
Let me see.	3722.0165921837556
Cider.	16997.075953601572
Yes, bottle of cider.	6237.373916002417
— What ’ s that?	1070.5066707719686
Mr Dedalus said.	1557.9361486882747
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	6680.9464731756225
Begone dull care.	18227.54902377354
Come, Bob.	7318.306251603228
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	13249.751187505199
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	8943.670073404995
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	17932.61452774436
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	13206.678099547338
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	16682.902352833207
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	13604.221233457512
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	13303.736415385645
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	11946.947628871018
He ’ s off.	2103.1199375700608
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	15287.25397875327
Jingling.	14336.178182593083
He ’ s gone.	1465.1436755190398
Jingle.	8172.165736889734
Hear.	14336.178182593083
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	5926.188314200294
God be with old times.	11877.225954579257
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	13323.9468166115
Gone.	4782.2098951201715
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	16868.487024965427
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	15354.66512889483
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	10461.364669004017
There was.	4067.6890697819363
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	5263.9622146404345
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	8255.574059295957
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	8819.275341412835

Tuned probably.	18679.07077551165
Stopped again.	14193.453893600445
Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.	16271.04294698232
— With it, Simon.	5924.69058552277
— It, Simon.	2811.969388432232
— Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.	10893.205597798134

— I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.	10531.824146068944
By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady ’ s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.	14567.930590526159
The harping chords of prelude closed.	8254.458994756533
A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.	11270.831868365593
— _When first I saw that form endearing_...	9805.546867595524
Richie turned.	12825.524320071201

Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.	16883.448887228955
Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar.	13724.104692814257
So. That will do.	9286.378237820945
Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.	14274.710268559696
— _Sorrow from me seemed to <URL> Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives.	14748.50186989341
Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard.	14210.460494000601
When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn ’ t expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.	15002.08510740443
Love that is singing: love ’ s old sweet song.	11710.433209728555
Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet.	12304.7220915156
Love ’ s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	9813.08384906779
Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	14884.98007498128
— _Full of hope and all delighted_...	9351.00568971699
Tenors get women by the score.	15876.99308527025

Hands felt for the opulent.	10985.405545545558
Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.	16605.27055147329
— _But alas, ’ twas idle dreaming_...	9805.546867595524
Glorious tone he has still.	15150.556721689882
Cork air softer also their brogue.	17570.648302713715
Silly man! Could have made oceans of money.	14928.251229729789
Singing wrong words.	15868.195079096857
Wore out his wife: now sings.	16682.90235283324
But hard to tell.	8304.584135674751
Only the two themselves.	11003.460012239257
If he doesn ’ t break down.	8398.845888580341
Keep a trot for the avenue.	12243.57588032034

How strange! Today.	9347.516016992688
The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied.	8190.2467957045255
It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait.	13394.331867832525
How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom ’ s heart.	14186.456102174803
Wish I could see his face, though.	12651.854434283401

In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel.	12728.242712182224

But Bloom sang dumb.	8304.584135674751
Admiring.	19456.598729469286
Richie, admiring, descanted on that man ’ s glorious voice.	14933.964759408274
He remembered one night long ago.	7873.501926046016
Never forget that night.	9678.615412506188

The night Si sang.	5834.595658445753
The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.	11921.284113977003
That voice was a lamentation.	9214.787456660213
Calmer now.	18679.07077551165

Vibrations.	16997.075953601572
Now silent air.	9738.638533683663
Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong.	13493.301173127731
He drew and plucked.	5339.449005254706
It buzz, it twanged.	9064.908611066421
While Goulding talked of Barraclough ’ s voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played.	15519.513431590178
While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.	15237.321696632118

at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye.	16830.443352602546
I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.	13269.794843287904
— Lo, Joe, says I.	4423.788755936908
How are you blowing?	6681.475483139947
Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	11636.364410685337
— Soot ’ s luck, says Joe.	6581.032483343623
Who ’ s the old ballocks you were talking to?	9162.41949558573
— Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	10207.468613173529
— What are you doing round those parts?	5099.390078585911
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Devil a much, says I.	6251.900667190283
There ’ s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane — old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him — lifted any God ’ s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop - of - my - thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.	14315.80402382698
— Circumcised?	3451.237535283804
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Ay, says I.	1541.4386824533608
A bit off the top.	7352.63749313142
An old plumber named Geraghty.	9540.871698474723
I ’ m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can ’ t get a penny out of him.	9645.803377918797

says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Ay, says I.	1541.4386824533608
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts.	10890.969750506481
But that ’ s the most notorious bloody robber you ’ d meet in a day ’ s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.	14464.329316402649

— Are you a strict <URL>.?	5088.985625246883

— Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	6657.67273164404
— What about paying our respects to our friend?	6270.710800990109
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Who?	710.3041491697493
says I.	2679.387231412323
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	15314.729868408755
— Drinking his own stuff?	6753.184526697845
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Ay, says I.	1541.4386824533608
Whisky and water on the brain.	17570.648302713715
— Come around to Barney Kiernan ’ s, says Joe.	6609.086164871735
I want to see the citizen.	5710.969476404036
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	7971.94195563706
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	16702.366946211594
— Not a word, says Joe.	5169.077882561309
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	7861.828424448821
— What was that, Joe?	4261.674655700494
says I.	2679.387231412323
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	9087.36981255204
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	8330.409706146684
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	13323.85349039594
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	15738.377838078517
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	13629.608253272203
For trading without a licence, says he.	9157.978220702653
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	12937.860779772815
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	11684.05174658533
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	13770.288015533173
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	15214.530089066291
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	14562.913421296693
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	16206.481828305234
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	15192.666332454399
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	14692.213342639088
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	16540.637816937884
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	9712.117996466515
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	16248.132659595527
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	15424.34658508091
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	10747.139637040691
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	10905.280587277222
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	14286.354347934921
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	11431.549992121896
— Stand and deliver, says he.	5646.875130443283
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	3132.940679368454
Friends here.	18679.07077551165
— Pass, friends, says he.	6098.921479444983
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	12126.641506890124
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	14705.041063352648
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	9852.057150457498
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	10020.46432307437
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	14513.553711347075
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	12024.64783025571
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	7494.881141537702
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	8954.107138865586
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	5564.566666955913
— Wine of the country, says he.	6738.291089654602
— What ’ s yours?	2098.716829035883
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	5536.509376612946
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	5227.626424008785
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	10295.077611738483
says he.	3811.5863753148074
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	6483.293362491599
What Garry?	5310.3952380902765
Are we going to win?	9982.382659154555
Eh?	4374.936102783538
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	13265.007298096369
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	14224.129036197632
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	15638.156345730486
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	13967.59753592113
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	12622.068984489151
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	15122.48724573266
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	13565.597454199975
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	16289.263798257522
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	14634.149362858978
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	16144.112079369383
Fursa, S.	18227.54902377354
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn ’ t, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	16549.038056459518
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.	16712.85923794833
Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O ’ Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O ’ Sullivan Beare.	16449.540661059214
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	15309.740935824473
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	14216.780712124311
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	8109.012139177346
A goodlooking sovereign.	6108.478345590255
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	6744.308112273398
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	8145.289014482269
says I.	2679.387231412323
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	6581.032483343623
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	14151.651358690344
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	11933.42528691666
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	13226.800635340822
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	9743.359820025753
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	17041.351916654137
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	9757.710478077319
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	9614.294651306222
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	7757.778400852642
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	14986.78720801732
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	15586.43510400889
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	13109.448420164814
How ’ s that, eh?	5925.350822719849
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	16697.386171804
Eh?	4374.936102783538
Deaths.	19456.598729469286
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	16790.99485282068
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	6825.903324036148
— Cockburn.	3451.237535283804
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	16760.742224363035
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	12123.978426055257
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	7545.725332056003
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	13228.232585047035
Drink that, citizen.	13956.939215319308
— I will, says he, honourable person.	4739.665802962609
— Health, Joe, says I.	4423.788755936908
And all down the form.	6959.639666047686
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	13443.678780972627
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	15374.503447440655
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	15027.096471271661
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	14578.931748294332
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	13172.405527299657
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	9480.970798352058
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	14171.832388087703
I thought Alf would split.	6797.537237816869
— Look at him, says he.	4875.734733772863
Breen.	19456.598729469286
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	7983.8471001097905
p: up on it to take a li...	11217.052175520716
And he doubled up.	4754.950351897881
— Take a what?	4667.24088220426
says I.	2679.387231412323
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	9894.475490883753
— O hell! says I.	5077.461794733193
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	13256.44132908521
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	8492.781854622875
— Who?	710.3041491697493
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Breen, says Alf.	4934.217406316941
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	12469.036807369186
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	11507.711944858704
U.	3158.059116295929
p: up.	3169.3138900431404
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	13719.394376148806
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	10263.310117374987
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	9012.672872073632
Is that Alf Bergan?	7602.740594893719
— Yes, says Alf.	1325.2895598882048
Hanging?	14336.178182593083
Wait till I show you.	6041.784068842105
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	10980.087903806429
You should have seen long John ’ s eye.	10988.69830816378
U.	3158.059116295929
p....	9124.363849360674
— Who are you laughing at?	3816.6100302673576
says Bob Doran.	4255.480005672212
Is that Bergan?	6509.08804908772
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	7114.00070311352
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	16560.301960694353
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	15421.7028005164
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	15032.257148596276
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	13864.475071622779
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	16600.387126377616
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	6710.465213876225
— What ’ s that?	1070.5066707719686
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	8772.863015077579
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	14930.31085557543
Hangmen ’ s letters.	17932.61452774436
Look at here.	5673.982723553613
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	12680.0564642175
— Are you codding?	3021.2247766495793
says I.	2679.387231412323
— Honest injun, says Alf.	5739.09658787971
Read them.	12825.524320071201
So Joe took up the letters.	10112.561011674841
— Who are you laughing at?	3816.6100302673576
says Bob Doran.	4255.480005672212
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	12476.894860662782
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	16161.175729144177
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	3208.0014207158683
Only I was running after that...	12948.08922278228
— You what?	2544.776795004336
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	8717.392059182535
With who?	7431.836760265275
— With Dignam, says Alf.	5118.066911747028
— Is it Paddy?	3248.554952116755
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Yes, says Alf.	1325.2895598882048
Why?	1363.914055113649
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	6542.454042135647
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	7292.558106537128
— Ay, says Joe.	1567.2456581535507
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	12367.023182318542
— Who ’ s dead?	3182.959389935725
says Bob Doran.	4255.480005672212
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	9533.240265699746
— What?	681.7536505896779
says Alf.	2679.387231412323
Good Christ, only five...	12153.168439876845
What?...	2808.83007836196
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	12300.635330658552
What?	694.4811020788688
Dignam dead?	11288.406558228855
— What about Dignam?	2796.1716524447256
says Bob Doran.	4255.480005672212
Who ’ s talking about...?	6656.9679741317295
— Dead! says Alf.	5447.535268740712
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	5368.406020254533
— Maybe so, says Joe.	4969.385653658877
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	11730.107923515714
— Paddy?	3118.5687368668796
says Alf.	2679.387231412323
— Ay, says Joe.	1567.2456581535507
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	11137.002772028036
— Good Christ! says Alf.	4520.5239391668165
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	16667.397432479003
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	14619.194040167991
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	16830.3113653921
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	16712.893709665084
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	15178.369944712764
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	16656.907336149598
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	15870.296748191544
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	16684.30476655942
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	13414.700656880654
Mind C.	14855.255256694101
K.	6161.259241909894
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	16868.487024965427
J.	363.7765778926278
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	11987.244647783826
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	16236.457465233065
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	13468.486421560265
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	16917.697281476372
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	10224.087923021618
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	17076.136894926323
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	16959.24882930963
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	5896.515676569338
— Who?	710.3041491697493
— Bloom, says he.	3063.6609960944897
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	7795.747530590861
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	12017.911359613387
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	12287.761454525322
Faith, he was.	15665.739701619705
— Good Christ! says he.	4929.629029939305
I could have sworn it was him.	6838.868436176272
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	13849.666286020127
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	4454.3280731581035
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	8495.518715257458
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	7950.499226852356
He ’ s over all his troubles.	4181.346213331258
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	8838.591799001235
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	7224.757314259324
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	16576.05692046341
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	12836.93644449451
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	8998.207188993567
Talking through his bloody hat.	15550.35106674391
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	16640.753079112437
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	5336.008690692176
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	9919.934579628634
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	12657.937405967115
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	14084.27702252152
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	7668.419893727205
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	13688.459308718113
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	8331.211999638264
Listen to this, will you?	10809.952836737746
And he starts reading out one.	5659.537972262718
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	14753.550657053866
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... _ — Jesus, says I.	14718.295787316318
— _...	4993.517422394024
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	16918.038405352916
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	13930.514015932875
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	12351.435667404648
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	5822.285650671164
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	13116.208455540016
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	8228.805419647957
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	7163.678698818707
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	13044.443671705398
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	11792.414877578554
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	13682.419267487938
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	10479.02731513996
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	15586.017123314543
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	14884.259011617425
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	7725.964415366524
— What ’ s that?	1070.5066707719686
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	8195.06942743637
— That so?	1617.7119198771989
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	5566.959814566002
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	12185.03737865244
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	12271.62467376611
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	10594.881666075813
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	6346.175676292444
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	7631.5067771515
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	11518.61463080504
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	16040.356215904376
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	15781.212482565417
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	17041.351916654137
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	13413.722775797742
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	12707.193298207534
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	12635.455960635414
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	14639.298212876729
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	14035.851808187317
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	11587.621487684686
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	16288.237932248847
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	16115.903157500043
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	11724.196160940106
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	11079.510728317977
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	15121.745127843742
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	16289.066200372446
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	2680.2328019378406
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	6569.77766308078
What I mean is...	8166.575601754621
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	6694.983657693925
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	16899.786054421136
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	8035.018932835759
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	14102.586593834907
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	14147.360456619457
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	15146.084262124097
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	16726.466422629215
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	15466.180559136043
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	15066.62846312724
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	14388.86523798952
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	15100.918274586169
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	16647.37989381618
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	13334.117166251452
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	13919.879942387639

E.	2132.7942562045123
I.	808.6542650785982
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	16583.71885415623
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	13652.278340511008
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	14128.844956755542
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	11921.284113977003
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	15898.98236476088
O.	1174.1571553791387
T.	3538.2054799403722

Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	16675.73189158372
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	13894.322714821486
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	16113.790812094749
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	13906.237872979667
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	15617.29718056798
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	6787.455493149124
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	14912.456369429792
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	14940.371211353202
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	16027.632423363691
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	14983.798216133428
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	15753.678020861478
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	13348.772228819616
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	16341.82298756944
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	14559.599148310888
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	12139.65151336103
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	16782.713263309317
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	15282.994165376136
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	15364.362974816522
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	12152.389940585275
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	14547.851520670443
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	15778.69372903112
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	15910.828967821313
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	15977.162406728286
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	15336.646917456474
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	15778.97479129087
Antitreating is about the size of it.	17451.623842446083
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	12964.792664649218
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	15214.810410080378
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	14298.161685211302
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	12840.404702403219
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	13172.344223051294
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	14589.22262891914
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	9139.603216722702
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	13886.897828575227
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	7876.345456317607
says the citizen, jeering.	6500.6617109773615
— No, says I.	2010.7845733901556
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	9299.34606377181
So he calls the old dog over.	10018.654541345591
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	3743.041626124677
says he.	3811.5863753148074
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	13432.121865775092
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	15163.892059040112
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	15709.737710609872
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	16868.487024965427
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	15328.788901042144
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	13894.335849841533
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	15853.315415545474
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	14226.860726981336
O.	1174.1571553791387
C.	1161.2080535937555
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	16684.324178323823
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	15285.246795742183
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	14433.938566281175
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	15530.098665085268
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	14433.938566281175
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	13779.37643417553
And Joe asked him would he have another.	10225.323468402516
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	8315.001918263188
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	9532.333315553346
Entertainment for man and beast.	17724.87334026543
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	10649.294865585438
— Could a swim duck?	6753.184526697845
says I.	2679.387231412323
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	5501.5718859033495
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	12941.468298314734
says he.	3811.5863753148074
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	4588.354690725335
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	12030.778955574877
Martin asked me to go to the house.	13285.38858548641
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	14565.31836655226
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	11344.701063320657
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	11686.92462407247
— Whose admirers?	4353.1969629641135
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	6974.060890681761
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	12496.549125556323
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	15339.148837380195
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	10060.51873068663
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	15704.086944695578
Choking with bloody foolery.	17932.61452774436
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	12000.355151384725
Shake hands, brother.	14932.412306617918
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	7887.530914170681
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	14061.027771873763
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	12760.673986226579
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	13591.542430470787
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	8985.10599626316
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	14756.747307598715
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	10709.3000522307
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	16112.538316513788
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	15109.685029003715
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	16423.125376244814
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	14956.536414177885
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	13142.767961741367
_How is your testament?	17932.61452774436
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	12644.381617117604
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	15334.23267611848
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	15550.418269367428
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	9437.438190480141
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	10746.035952192778
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	15364.472607589576
So Terry brought the three pints.	10638.308058097804
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	7585.389575878744
Here, citizen.	7529.423693769067
— _Slan leat_, says he.	5384.335762747442
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	4042.6478215188868
Good health, citizen.	10421.353401935503
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	10631.974988624297
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	12896.793011693551
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	8267.376285790653
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	6454.838746271866
— Nannan?	3118.5687368668796
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
The mimber?	4122.464502427211
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	5539.868604096716
— I thought so, says Joe.	3281.2462743764527
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	10218.706144765332
P., the cattle traders.	6952.948445832359
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	11412.196694674663
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	14997.360590063425
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	11834.21245421578
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	16109.920952338965
Mister Knowall.	18679.07077551165
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	17451.623842446083
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	16736.760114312656
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	13671.495853550578
What ’ s your programme today?	4978.297207647722
Ay. Humane methods.	11130.212225830395
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	14590.135780904415
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	9164.711098291717
Klook Klook Klook.	10579.11673623956
Black Liz is our hen.	14298.161685211302
She lays eggs for us.	8932.73161892921
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	12251.51626618547
Gara.	19456.598729469286
Klook Klook Klook.	10579.11673623956
Then comes good uncle Leo.	9779.406899407832
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	10819.081209577245
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	17724.87334026543
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	7978.52062469876
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	8816.648259265492
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	8661.307298529997
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	3734.3900747042444
I wanted particularly.	4764.354976474335
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	13659.238031252198
I couldn ’ t phone.	5232.133857973895
No. You ’ re sure?	7031.247214851891
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	6647.169667976612
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	12316.49743194465
What do you think of that, citizen?	6969.399849843744
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	13447.349451475999
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	8137.910758423958
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	16165.093419871193
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	8277.916980094644
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	16883.471093556833
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	8358.033128852328
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	11108.741518187659
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	10423.673808609079
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	15849.187003053083
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	13553.852745039212
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	14904.293308312253
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	8277.916980094644
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	15556.715240825512
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	14985.558777251761
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	15966.38595565523
There he is sitting there.	6217.650997032267
The man that got away James Stephens.	5511.614333505057
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	10781.081801603794
What was your best throw, citizen?	7977.330776506259
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	9224.161103136204
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	10461.385766973093
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	5648.137954832873
You were and a bloody sight better.	8882.747167588466
— Is that really a fact?	4522.991479824307
says Alf.	2679.387231412323
— Yes, says Bloom.	1373.7108849633794
Did you not know that?	8670.083554835846
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	15288.071627814523
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	13740.779241904409
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	13341.778606355194
Do you see that straw?	7001.28867255531

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	15045.069365209538
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	12520.095116987566
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	15609.317740581513
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	15174.315719796472

Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	15671.244221162715
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	13797.04281780583
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	15299.565278034062
The proceedings then terminated.	6549.046155587141

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	11388.862366247007
— No, says Joe.	1883.13502721197
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	7977.481437325647
— Who?	710.3041491697493
Blazes?	10426.63014497102
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	12629.24459675775
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	3717.1954839601617
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	11517.022494197143
— We know him, says the citizen.	4000.7752168139764
The traitor ’ s son.	6250.259316384262
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	10444.579455306937
— True for you, says Joe.	4593.645125652231
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	12070.694387687006
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	17215.988293285944
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	15471.128655969336
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	13194.837965946148
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	14114.384357143554
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	11682.434664678667
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	16854.774611847082
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	10781.081801603794
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	14608.80427142149
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	14006.260617395463
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	12840.218585308325
The men came to handigrips.	7054.376609466871
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	16581.456599053643
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	14567.890190309445
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	8816.39543510538
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	10058.332797941513
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	12840.218585308325
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	15471.118277626492
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	16459.43484707877
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	6460.653848414464
— He is, says Joe.	3020.491452886026
Isn ’ t he?	7040.022932166348
— Who?	710.3041491697493
says Bloom.	3811.5863753148074
Ah, yes.	3688.7648853717174
That ’ s quite true.	3270.823543553548
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	7984.472437237601

says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— My wife?	3222.4352989245012
says Bloom.	3811.5863753148074
She ’ s singing, yes.	5395.851622269378
I think it will be a success too.	7875.3526344209795

Ay, and done says I.	10852.26524127765
Gob, he ’ ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I ’ m thinking.	11309.487458496062

And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	12398.153247132881
— Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	8156.189516624706
God, I ’ d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	11810.120164831756
— Was it you did it, Alf?	7793.308838500038
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	11822.928240875422
— Me?	3118.5687368668796
says Alf.	2679.387231412323
Don ’ t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	8306.61301130927
— Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	11885.59985304319
— Of course an action would lie, says J.	6971.328329702768
J.	363.7765778926278
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	10854.766665942077
U.	3158.059116295929
p: up.	3169.3138900431404
_ — Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	8492.674816197808
Do you know that he ’ s balmy?	7086.237526621094
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	10324.86581263508
— Yes, says J.	1175.533883437119
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	11545.258350548043
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	6319.550989709575
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	11326.116988899937
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	5244.792624431205
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	12648.393575507103
— How half and half?	4764.526597827205
says Bloom.	3811.5863753148074
Do you mean he...	7148.052536035615
— Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	5602.508330281428
A fellow that ’ s neither fish nor flesh.	9871.021958449099
— Nor good red herring, says Joe.	6581.032483343623
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	9765.94507484316
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	16682.958428308033
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	12973.074446695036
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	16577.632543400265
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’ s was pewopener to the pope.	12968.547615404665
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’ s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	16398.93586152567
And who was he, tell us?	8580.181797874642
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	14001.44518569973
— And moreover, says J.	3907.928847948748
J., a postcard is publication.	6132.620571265084
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	10462.110439420696
Hole.	19456.598729469286
In my opinion an action might lie.	9465.090788730693
Six and eightpence, please.	13493.54887677821
Who wants your opinion?	9827.298447216312
Let us drink our pints in peace.	10379.950520613414
Gob, we won ’ t be let even do that much itself.	12404.325959827589
— Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	5721.131463672839
— Good health, Ned, says J.	5797.371773050918
J.	363.7765778926278
— - There he is again, says Joe.	6406.647902898129
— Where?	2253.791494298109
says Alf.	2679.387231412323
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	14532.194390126653
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	7218.557350522185
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Remanded, says J.	5064.356379111555
J.	363.7765778926278
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	14221.481986417262
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	10407.618462417826
Course it was a bloody barney.	14198.982637419229
What?	694.4811020788688
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	16917.697281476372
J.	363.7765778926278
J.	363.7765778926278
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	16568.892525475672
— Who tried the case?	4565.786891093073
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Recorder, says Ned.	5447.605881247264
— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	11840.55080214623
— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	8650.599416755203
— Ay, says Alf.	1957.79946780376
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	16258.246957648907
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	12470.804041132365
Ten, did you say?	13894.212333769912
— Yes, your worship.	2524.724303034102
And my wife has the typhoid.	8620.480584613277
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	9161.733776507459
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	9481.113014725373
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	14549.481948078186
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	15276.832506423802
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	15851.583448548065
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	11430.445534569242
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	13817.744568182046
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	12700.648309417373
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	14321.642661938775
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	13357.07739502158
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	13923.24843708379
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	13065.953466901889
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	10760.584591141429
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	15166.46893284015
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	12745.04953191696
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	11228.865202127055
That ’ s the whole secret.	3303.717745488092
— Rely on me, says Joe.	5940.975785299395
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	9812.040150565503
We want no more strangers in our house.	11717.864050840679
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	7158.697421815476
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	4895.867608057125
— Consider that done, says Joe.	5940.975785299395
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	6330.382686075214
— The strangers, says the citizen.	3141.896388197098
Our own fault.	10537.512508412203
We let them come in.	10111.88095965841
We brought them in.	9316.809644546893
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	10403.972071259352
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	8239.274872544624
J.	363.7765778926278
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	14569.394612665987
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	9393.718718427961
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	11475.82046704966
— Give us a squint at her, says I.	6125.3008506932765

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	13815.254225068451
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	14100.434329030413
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	7744.651457762676
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	11628.010915469966
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	15403.476929638968
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	4151.393875089758
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	11823.434925800024
J.	363.7765778926278
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	16658.986576198215
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	6139.573973608618
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	14401.76984918792
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	14777.051890611185
Tonguetied sons of bastards ’ ghosts.	17570.648302713715

— They ’ re not European, says the citizen.	4733.801719108746
I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	6649.883377130664
You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	13821.3769260672
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	15354.208751195083
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	5889.655462496773
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	11788.963002605273
— Gold cup, says he.	5384.335762747442
— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	5362.332261270601
says Terry.	5590.867382325272
_ — Throwaway, _ says he, at twenty to one.	8635.44294629943
A rank outsider.	6108.478345590255

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	14334.01936121853
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	16412.615444866766
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	15267.211686665762
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	15043.04534683801
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	16712.882218737355
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	15421.286497084446
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	12948.883928309942
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	5320.731235325106
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	14342.775619092085
— And will again, says Joe.	3780.8191502887553
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	10022.637923199565
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	16045.748425161075
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	15255.740373363906
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	8865.089927133742

What will you have?	6220.541793415133
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	10564.923027305686
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	9364.224242053473
Terry! Are you asleep?	16727.42622563514
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	2367.4892579744323
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	15316.253852478543

Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	13813.8678792987
— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	10306.877057567248
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	3754.6116673268684
Hell upon earth it is.	14820.693222644375
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	14660.200764896172
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	9375.108430733733
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	15186.179415517645
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	12076.99530045691
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	11843.484772386046
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	13891.563723253328
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	6610.809236662026
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	13389.392935258284
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	7389.441582246054
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	7417.801987153184
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	7831.096438416577
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	7475.025159920183
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	15666.406566835847
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	9336.454748178798
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	10967.491573387058
Didn ’ t I tell you?	9609.779969572008
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	14537.803540774494
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	5290.137382421461
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	9579.749475083765
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	10529.969925013867
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	15677.747462703488
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	12864.521015686822
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	13361.538808284644
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	12628.58664839584
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	15313.485572694599
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	12359.854330556002
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	12519.586858325967
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	5922.158495482112
But my point was...	8796.419215640433
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	8924.428189956838
— Ay, says John Wyse.	2522.609979602837
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	13653.246889089687
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	13351.61319840644
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	12547.932007705556
Fontenoy, eh?	18227.54902377354
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	13740.82720406943
But what did we ever get for it?	10204.188749988129
— The French! says the citizen.	3939.3898061035516
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	16635.434462292815
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	9661.285144989455
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	10207.421110946216
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	13236.832892206197
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	15357.534719556272
— Well, says J.	1897.7503600301752
J.	363.7765778926278
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	8793.208657164107
— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	5657.769118614493
Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	16464.74997035876
The earl of Dublin, no less.	8916.453222764361
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	10619.523025057766
And says J.	4794.4365187759695
J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	9647.643644888807
— Will you try another, citizen?	6474.9006322865325
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Yes, sir, says he.	1833.2272457950573
I will.	2340.5706358512725
— You?	1594.0687348580918
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	5621.753786879516
May your shadow never grow less.	14559.54209314761
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	5940.975785299395
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	11669.995815800161
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	17724.87334026543
— But do you know what a nation means?	7585.264393949312
says John Wyse.	4428.668697672495
— Yes, says Bloom.	1373.7108849633794
— What is it?	1285.7135923413941
says John Wyse.	4428.668697672495
— A nation?	2785.265668897219
says Bloom.	3811.5863753148074
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	10924.826087830528
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	13005.864204501124
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	14842.461343640825
— What is your nation if I may ask?	5625.841604214845
says the citizen.	2170.0506909088035
— Ireland, says Bloom.	5114.496005239136
Ireland.	11785.827218061331
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	13637.229804873916
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	11460.19708031711
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	4625.572911854368
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	14806.128056338772
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	14224.094149365303
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	15712.227734929973
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	14914.030576590945
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	16594.458304556363
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	16545.146279894336
— Show us over the drink, says I.	7005.082077736549
Which is which?	12352.082759196523
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	7575.888795421077
Also now.	10505.443060228716
This very moment.	8633.536185438385
This very instant.	8633.536185438385
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	10953.675185405642
— Robbed, says he.	4587.204588713143
Plundered.	19456.598729469286
Insulted.	19456.598729469286
Persecuted.	19456.598729469286
Taking what belongs to us by right.	15446.433163739166
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	14133.192185705815
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	5962.081991818853
says the citizen.	2170.0506909088035
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	3840.5856105686407
— Right, says John Wyse.	4105.549479518707
Stand up to it then with force like men.	15071.800082522368
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	5537.773615300893
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	15150.622186653598
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	13319.8695958014
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	12031.463903319944
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	12074.139270124893
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	6459.253377087632
Force, hatred, history, all that.	17356.98505688499
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	7613.115922359961
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	12658.1075833516
— What?	681.7536505896779
says Alf.	2679.387231412323
— Love, says Bloom.	4826.683551785659
I mean the opposite of hatred.	6243.810760713224
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	8846.704770820164
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	13897.335620060005
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	11941.050073192553
Just a moment.	6866.606669553118
Who ’ s hindering you?	6011.726033367645
And off he pops like greased lightning.	9267.046615300755
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	5579.913975228244
Universal love.	18679.07077551165
— Well, says John Wyse.	2655.4649149980905
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	10766.058489732064
Love your neighbour.	11090.4665007323
— That chap?	2451.9334177645032
says the citizen.	2170.0506909088035
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	15669.322221546165
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	14111.323501142746
Love loves to love love.	12429.55752372533
Nurse loves the new chemist.	16727.42622563514
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	14894.997898413925
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	13160.941406856915
M.	2002.7549511405832
B.	2096.6593473913545
loves a fair gentleman.	17932.61452774436
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	14351.898430809993
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	9229.74314037574
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	11472.631280483029
Mrs Norman W.	11185.202976064158
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	15976.304393411037
You love a certain person.	9221.483806420649
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	12167.18939505717
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	7409.999401353478
More power, citizen.	10453.450247261799
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	5940.975785299395
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	8865.089927133742
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	9433.804971442163
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	13938.281767051478
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	13113.24841092391
— What ’ s that?	1070.5066707719686
says Joe.	1066.6197465906066
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	15651.936962230882
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	15574.991505485317
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	15327.01598309853
— Widow woman, says Ned.	6258.31628779116
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	6041.176559295496
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	13708.691941593972
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	7599.892343470917
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	11423.585078336957
— Is that by Griffith?	3758.603816665238
says John Wyse.	4428.668697672495
— No, says the citizen.	1860.337220510549
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	3938.5344889812027
It ’ s only initialled: P.	4618.928614243022
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	5466.914911288466
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	4465.688483875921
Trade follows the flag.	17932.61452774436
— Well, says J.	1897.7503600301752
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	11213.33363907814
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	12672.064610317924
— Casement, says the citizen.	3936.4553107137667
He ’ s an Irishman.	2557.240339964423
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	3999.3607799431543
J.	363.7765778926278
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	16583.61852250147
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	7130.9894423605
— Who?	710.3041491697493
says I.	2679.387231412323
— Bloom, says he.	3063.6609960944897
The courthouse is a blind.	7475.025159920183
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	11113.320970509172
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	4878.909240566209
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	10376.45648408228
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	4761.022267487628
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	13011.671197033716
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	5564.942978287483
A dark horse.	5632.710288770742
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	4611.002970393284
— Mind, Joe, says I.	4228.926575036277
Show us the entrance out.	13722.395646020701
— There you are, says Terry.	5852.27499269553
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	13933.76336409252
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	16109.374650434213
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	15526.650349547675
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	17724.87334026543
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	13059.615499209724
Give us a bloody chance.	8796.687533014752
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	12865.457790094533
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	5288.830457718918
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	14093.687911674893
Loans by post on easy terms.	17570.648302713715
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	14928.251229729789
Distance no object.	16807.8688531982
No security.	6159.577739645505
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	11879.7165121193
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	5290.271074079502
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	11886.579008005907
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	16222.440886656199
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	13900.641477420193
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	12082.900900198865
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	16937.421557610043
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	15447.08392164873
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	10620.926704784202
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	10207.373606066014
Look to our steeds.	10734.826347864153
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	12082.919176347346
I know not what to offer your lordships.	7687.933300900383
— How now, fellow?	4764.526597827205
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	16581.57235200974
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	12874.586844034844
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	9805.546867595524
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	14410.614524951858
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	12893.585365435183
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	11349.352778142358
Hast aught to give us?	16727.42622563514
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	16275.886027015482
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	8239.274872544624
That likes me well.	8359.805223348141
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	17162.064257603583
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	12042.577620706998
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	11288.81190648029
— Where is he?	3036.1259819062225
says Lenehan.	7577.763833649201
Defrauding widows and orphans.	17932.61452774436
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	11220.021326101807
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	3403.4199622237034
Or so they allege.	8841.41724193621
— I, says Joe.	2418.6336864598097
I ’ m the alligator.	2317.8317128177246
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	10698.941913776425
— Why not?	3299.2859984315032
says J.	5590.867382325272
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	10812.037331693175
says Ned.	5590.867382325272
Or who is he?	9459.501266498186
No offence, Crofton.	8559.348879233634
— Who is Junius?	3282.6978113781906
says J.	5590.867382325272
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	9265.577191318967
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	10498.057556892705
We know that in the castle.	9860.070672426444
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	8698.70585895153
says Jack Power.	8166.976190181595
— Not at all, says Martin.	5132.164235262171
Only namesakes.	9935.810101976167
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	11752.75054087226
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	9638.29914779087
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	4978.5574694147
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	15867.884234059702
For that matter so are we.	10535.337865370506
— Yes, says J.	1175.533883437119
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	10333.896322337734
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	13923.353733167161
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	9380.293305178924
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	9770.60940694893
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	12931.79634850547
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	7221.594070222213
J.	363.7765778926278
— Do you call that a man?	5160.30464604354
says the citizen.	2170.0506909088035
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	6951.178156371818
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	7407.879176772966
— And who does he suspect?	5026.989296345241
says the citizen.	2170.0506909088035
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	10514.633587068665
One of those mixed middlings he is.	8333.876738124549
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	16591.19453983083
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	5941.735253262962
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	12575.478783961076
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	13334.815390441858
Give us your blessing.	8888.659351156251
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	7689.958675646025
But where is he?	8304.584135674751
We can ’ t wait.	9542.887584620756
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	6029.936012332079
That ’ s what he is.	3863.567072003195
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	15208.151067088516
Cursed by God.	18227.54902377354
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	7971.700925789524
says Ned.	5590.867382325272
— Only one, says Martin.	6037.263986507612
We must be quick.	8300.417467093757

Crofton?	19456.598729469286
Three half ones, Terry.	12288.345246564351
— Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	12223.755420318337
— Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	5917.744348576607
God bless all here is my prayer.	12782.184504998237
— Amen, says the citizen.	3741.9291499193105
— And I ’ m sure He will, says Joe.	6141.2208356521
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	15866.671935355263

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.	17724.87334026543
And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	15708.120097132492
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	15336.907285673165
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	13530.969841757948
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	14637.210683199584
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	13149.662939191683
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	15533.887313348636
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	10207.373606066014
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	8373.72122436795
And butter for fish.	7424.17538465336
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	12770.636136334166
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	7827.535880441801
I hope I ’ m not...	7807.503166931651
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	5949.301847415456
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	17115.978107251347
Mean bloody scut.	18227.54902377354
Stand us a drink itself.	15150.622186653598
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	14880.846913348876
Cute as a shithouse rat.	16727.42622563514
Hundred to five.	13492.619789445018
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	3791.1760501212493
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	8512.187101722346
Come along now.	8406.322930327025
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	6956.289162842665
It ’ s a secret.	2632.4563727328186
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	8595.934343064819
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	6752.085910262084
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	13998.44158275621
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	9479.812288846291
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	14224.082519736656
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	15577.188513728843
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	15130.96491634229
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	11754.517628272763
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	15594.142564372647
— Let me alone, says he.	4722.332117785488
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	14928.973960845253
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	14635.002935357654
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	13012.087125302329
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	15679.340532181972
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	8981.622404480857
Your God.	8651.32013639555
— He had no father, says Martin.	5163.497052060631
That ’ ll do now.	4598.62966312997
Drive ahead.	18679.07077551165
— Whose God?	4353.1969629641135
says the citizen.	2170.0506909088035
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	5658.810258196035
Your God was a jew.	10341.166535173596
Christ was a jew like me.	15316.311760780676
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	11868.495713816184
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	11481.658134512023
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	12295.671772423279
Give us that biscuitbox here.	9165.700875028326
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	8239.274872544624
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	11921.284113977003
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	15854.010335880761
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	14685.737503137005
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	16547.026405414337
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	16493.68179493313
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	17115.978107251347
And Ned and J.	7424.17538465336
J.	363.7765778926278
paralysed with the laughing.	16760.897092969924
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	11229.185975459002
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	13012.920666710734
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	4445.042556073589
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	14854.952852536187
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	16597.62768504971
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	9550.066078038664
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	13596.621737105457
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	9975.267020722324
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	14822.509275870136
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	14433.949216150708
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	14644.621391275274
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	13319.547141006262
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	15838.17617331253
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	15802.325113434825
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	16629.43066830989
The work of salvage, removal of _débris, _ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, <NUM> Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	13967.623144253484

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff.	11413.879458738891
Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he ’ d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	15051.336690024253
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	11185.14778932293
What?	694.4811020788688
O, Jesus, he did.	6193.873226181094
And he let a volley of oaths after him.	8377.006612659903
— Did I kill him, says he, or what?	7984.805784511307
And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	14555.211337658013
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	15748.584401242928
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	14895.22435967676
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	13858.74800012991
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	14933.837143718081
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	11413.09423104223
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	16132.057980558162
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	13142.246013057926
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	16233.508438417106
M.	2002.7549511405832
S.	2246.5143522196063
Belleisle_ printed on both.	17932.61452774436
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	15159.821232002387
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	13892.42201572576
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	13081.412918435983
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	12249.421431695238
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	14686.571133426944
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	7136.883820050594
Say out big, big.	13056.812122290823
I want a drink of water.	6678.904092292716
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	11680.271297480844
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	15836.034243879174
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	13778.65659344452
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	14646.339338569827
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	14232.77920729315
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	11068.960138165881
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	12768.289462408457
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	16331.141710601602
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	14433.938566281175
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	15072.736336356576
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	8093.906596644416
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	14339.197263461849
Wait till I catch you for that.	8377.262051278296
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	13141.355669867233
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	10374.235088188594
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	15276.459327122893
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	15348.796908135755
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	7628.587534281972
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	11700.148361661044
Butter and cream?	18227.54902377354
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	10636.169657666971
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	6351.066316972726
Cissy queried.	11699.385526317174
— Nao, Tommy said.	4934.004249618405
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	8254.921773100412
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	6807.456215240706
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	11638.452247271596
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	8165.037423420239
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	15706.346365307116
But who was Gerty?	8304.584135674751
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	15548.095899481636
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	12870.001380781001
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	15628.787985501427
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	13647.061490651671
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	15392.143047311842
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	16640.760071673147
No. Honour where honour is due.	7731.708497600014
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	13206.894094379451
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	16085.855492136236
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	16704.790038617986
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	11421.998585383766
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	14742.677880674179
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	13996.655284628438
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	14235.443328630094
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	14269.43078255833
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	11696.34891578249
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	11954.798505679599
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	8982.949651704028
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	13885.216266329993
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	14807.835459550755
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	12924.473956821657
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	10712.923549383031
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	17076.136894926323
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	14030.658197910168
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	14520.763339179597
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	15841.785728849183
E.	2132.7942562045123
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	17115.978107251347
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	15603.095340962469
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	14964.8515936507
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	13169.368222280964
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	15405.493731111306
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	15701.88155273737
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	15543.037867125397
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	14561.332670761438
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	15110.66832313875
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	15149.946253246972
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	15596.431475960448
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	15112.916994890546
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	14968.463620034769
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	15144.136336364369
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	15595.689660422893
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	12182.551717819164
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	15628.813312034052
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	9110.658555904236
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	11554.565360843248
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	12882.284979684802
C.	1161.2080535937555
D.	2550.969629454126
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	15505.479954327007
He was too young to understand.	5792.3142413364285
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	10087.28669996009
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	14138.02916514229
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	14398.067191828937
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	16782.713263309317
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	13577.493834032535
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	15701.884043305878
It would be like heaven.	7203.108495721047
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	12241.625237628416
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	15104.485510740216
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	14045.852312639336
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	14178.646422478889
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	13385.706342755562
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	16099.170946082506
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	16142.605387662206
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	15132.39656851268
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	13113.29799701507
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	16145.318726375554
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	6189.7288168363
It ’ s my ball.	3400.174861374015
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	14980.280974964775
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	9351.00568971699
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	14293.742203187265
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	13570.323183494535
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	8969.818495231102
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	8482.313328560254
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	15778.554514943735
But not a pin cared Ciss.	9863.782630541877
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	11196.717956172146
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	14793.165620745503
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	17570.648302713715
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	9292.049983011759
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	15306.98604104526
That was just like Cissycums.	6461.864553992102
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	13367.691489721195
There was none to come up to her for fun.	9359.321161028724
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	14278.71522531328
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	11946.826119839337
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	9869.516644294388
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	9117.50014626674
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	15276.374753872971
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	15476.048616513994
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	16065.265822225449
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	13449.245240899407
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	16118.746975027174
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	12376.014966768988
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	14922.768446413174
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	15261.227108068046
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	16012.930176011372
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	15186.200573025122
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	9385.086399101421
Now he was laid to rest.	10889.766136102025
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	15338.826842851344
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	14001.473421848947
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	14247.01989793427
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	15509.522558030554
You could see there was a story behind it.	10317.742003498199
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	12741.862818598198
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	15401.17571551766
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	13984.490286786486
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	16188.270811988432
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	14979.540264668292
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	14693.553273008478
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	7893.879201167553
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	13852.014720449115
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	16179.38907870998
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	16465.771505157645
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	15027.351884805097
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	15598.939957363249
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	11461.710221959553
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	14505.089891411235
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	16462.157367452986
— Say papa, baby.	6116.571900761086
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	11383.055834716739
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	14721.709310933345
— Haja ja ja haja.	6753.184526697845
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	16102.571216183014
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	11423.585078336957
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	14319.046744620484
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	15794.151708756424
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	9790.521649498627
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	9819.044839604363
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	10127.610124509476
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	12443.157943760405
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	15568.88640064323
People were so queer.	13956.939215319308
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	15532.305119008057
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	10999.681548245091
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	10284.129326438915
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	13535.786830444678
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	12870.016355153399
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	13501.207561052766
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	12950.89459406145
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	13961.242620677791
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	15265.182200710582
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	10661.1342473339
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	14289.401620192877
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	14786.869089351989
Refuge of sinners.	18227.54902377354
Comfortress of the afflicted.	17932.61452774436
_Ora pro nobis_.	18227.54902377354
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	15544.115689818202
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	16081.229500603222
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	14146.971601593154
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	15022.154100521926
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	15014.427187314017
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	13454.825445918668
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	13566.671310138481
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	16049.915745857441
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	13172.313573120264
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	13669.930604243029
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	15568.281180040172
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	15755.649189015861
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	14391.805749821457
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	15938.064450818367
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	16281.120462911193
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	15841.019042864305
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	16174.919819098532
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	15989.602752446974
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	12690.944142192278
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	13167.662139505861
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	13427.378776363421
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	8215.642092738217
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	15282.942160992612
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	15995.844590031715
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	16774.96806447455
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	10534.38951096853
— What?	681.7536505896779
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	17162.064257603583
I was only wondering was it late.	6715.5349439871425
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	15483.826987181654
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	13649.368065231429
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	12215.768584588503
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	12345.228621074582
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	15288.10631408417
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	17010.718138155575
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	14977.74820671829
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	16058.302889742094
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	14319.553606191932
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	15238.198146561877
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	15234.799887809233
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	13995.939479436282
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	14865.90852784261
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	13390.038465195596
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	13875.29388592709
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	10064.573532299388
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	16236.245319018846
Gerty winced sharply.	12026.716026539883
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	12109.620516064902
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	14605.44735171234
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	15609.83600207846
She had loved him better than he knew.	8329.64328549277
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	16760.727737707093
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	15003.91427939571
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	8921.739662363467
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	10790.39894759235
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	14423.367812512875
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	12809.081667752584
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	15084.9224455584
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	13723.094947153282
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	16115.263467729665
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	15790.730050431537
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	15329.54967947586
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	7005.505447839223
He has his bib destroyed.	5401.21053703787
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	12338.421226245811
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	16132.112193771316
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	15333.82145339471
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	15444.492371640506
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	12924.504032342698
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	15325.064348999118
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	15308.08754604662
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	16359.523789568655
But it must end, she felt.	8643.75886681165
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	13328.360333804669
Love laughs at locksmiths.	11852.99849689722
She would make the great sacrifice.	8112.2465614888
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	12431.841110369038
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	16605.27055147329
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	14816.222190266815
But even if — what then?	9045.196959303728
Would it make a very great difference?	13590.163994936875
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	13359.06039208783
No, no: not that.	6660.985411792801
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	14142.53560690354
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	14516.39611014209
She thought she understood.	8062.04001836782
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	10666.396972892604
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	12268.846199159516
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	16104.302347933852
Nothing else mattered.	12536.44797527997
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	13441.4426900563
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	16542.848453961324
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	4818.2906927166605
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	14077.43949758804
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	5573.8965271922
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	3311.999704012244
But Gerty was adamant.	7761.962422300686
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	9543.13893903606
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	13749.625722760911
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	9738.905063028538
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	12728.952562707658
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	16917.697281476372
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	15421.452336381466
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	11288.602357844957
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	15946.786511570577
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	14454.580130804177
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	16244.319266916647
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	15489.72035041193
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	16067.228702410424
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	15007.616059197137
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	15347.700257400813
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	14522.665708766563
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	7143.741858296625
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	15029.941724435934
What a brute he had been! At it again?	10330.020595062639
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	13040.515652795793
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	15481.297422445272
Should a girl tell?	16760.897092969924
No, a thousand times no.	7007.233754980379
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	14234.220621406577
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	15427.506307985237
Come on.	4221.334036659905
We can see from farther up.	10221.055056557272
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	14753.986048796578
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	14246.740421115921
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	10560.743889747431
She rose.	5087.8903360533795
Was it goodbye?	8830.65556642998
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	13270.87777260147
She drew herself up to her full height.	10316.853873635357
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	15439.194561832119
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	13912.148959320768
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	16172.32186078965
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	11464.087732707118
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	13519.738027424311
Tight boots?	13656.980144780464
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	11289.20546186394
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	14134.851304182706
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	15509.561656599442
Jilted beauty.	18679.07077551165
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	10512.986157440577
But makes them polite.	8304.584135674751
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	14333.184193864245
Hot little devil all the same.	12633.970104287368
I wouldn ’ t mind.	5232.133857973895
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	16627.414130203724
That squinty one is delicate.	9214.787456660213
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	14776.586059585043
I have such a bad headache today.	6157.9623298201805
Where did I put the letter?	8345.900181688792
Yes, all right.	5302.312976986495
All kinds of crazy longings.	8653.566179081627
Licking pennies.	18679.07077551165
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	14865.880422363396
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	17357.037563990434
How many women in Dublin have it today?	9815.217400894533
Martha, she.	11501.432152066216
Something in the air.	8855.890734033554
That ’ s the moon.	2624.9006100775605
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	12473.092609630627
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	16051.953953143342
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	12648.393575507103
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	16053.975985553223
Anyhow I got the best of that.	14766.136976064034
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	15941.010634195241
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	15446.433163739166
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	11754.610190537924
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	11038.870733831855
Thankful for small mercies.	17932.61452774436
Yours for the asking.	17932.61452774436
Because they want it themselves.	10944.801011439322
Their natural craving.	10832.462322740925
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	17279.93518182534
Reserve better.	18679.07077551165
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	9099.11257610682
Catch em alive, O.	16053.975985553223
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	13337.238981658495
A dream of wellfilled hose.	8117.899790053171
Where was that?	6362.468708188163
Ah, yes.	3688.7648853717174
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	17279.93518182534
Peeping Tom.	14193.346567858416
Willy ’ s hat and what the girls did with it.	17162.104194085827
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	12628.826527974641
_Lingerie_ does it.	18227.54902377354
Felt for the curves inside her <URL> Excites them also when they ’ re.	15910.625409673918
I ’ m all clean come and dirty me.	5306.033672859632
Milly delighted with Molly ’ s new blouse.	14190.13585116612
At first.	8123.496170061432
Put them all on to take them all off.	15071.8829622338
Molly.	6399.427872187878
Why I bought her the violet garters.	10918.874300435757
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	16614.95473623039
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	10087.11234684392
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	11061.29552097042
of jet.	14193.453893600445
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	14690.234537175456
Pinned together.	16878.573427268955
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	6154.264586483364
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	17451.623842446083
Fashion part of their charm.	17724.87334026543
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	13726.48715005615
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	16271.04294698232
No reasonable offer refused.	8559.348879233634
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	10743.7626457335
Always off to a fellow when they are.	13858.756305820938
They never forget an appointment.	8316.321393838663
Out on spec probably.	11420.102362980864
They believe in chance because like themselves.	9561.677783511688
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	8595.934343064819
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	16041.308934319715
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	16842.205272305415
Barbed wire.	18679.07077551165
Be sure now and write to me.	13672.00627557082
Now won ’ t you?	8276.210512645925
Molly and Josie Powell.	10105.524446714033
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	15035.126583979581
_Tableau! _ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	15990.857313728913
What have you been doing with yourself?	8344.717154752641
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	16091.095232717094
Picking holes in each other ’ s appearance.	16667.447851968176
You ’ re looking splendid.	3908.336795979079
Sister souls.	14193.453893600445
Showing their teeth at one another.	15876.993085270278
How many have you left?	8318.813130398461
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	11242.705720675067
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	12297.665422975535
Dark devilish appearance.	14632.365267767023
Scratch the sole of my foot.	16702.366946211594
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	12258.237230888511
Good to rest once in a way.	11106.161007591723
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	12352.083568976715
Safe in one way.	12680.784774942113
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	17570.648302713715
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	13339.298918657712
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	15124.576853348457
Daresay she felt I.	15393.126810427384
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	12288.597643125368
Liked me or what?	17932.61452774436
Dress they look at.	15976.304393411037
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	14082.457334994377
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	12786.65459118524
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	13786.455875334099
Trousers?	15443.024084639697
Suppose I when I was?	12322.05485053853
No. Gently does it.	6223.081943999336
Dislike rough and tumble.	15393.126810427384
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	16682.958428308033
Saw something in me.	14932.487582743664
Wonder what.	6632.055754052333
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	16899.786054421136
To aid gentleman in literary.	8178.0925358246295
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	13000.621575712505
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	11141.472371351343
Still, you never know.	8611.961785764568
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	16112.477388603033
Beauty and the beast.	13044.860982597318
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	15072.29741652356
Wide brim.	18679.07077551165
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	16388.33591387527
Hair strong in rut.	15393.126810427384
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	15024.021676697186
Why not?	4673.334370817344
Suppose he gave her money.	11825.965931331057
Why not?	4673.334370817344
All a prejudice.	6839.36135022798
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	8717.950832341532
What?	694.4811020788688
I think so.	4069.446456225734
All that for nothing.	7058.6248483556465
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	14084.442681196038
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	13561.3533777684
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	9437.458582943236
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	17356.98505688499
No, I remember.	4383.372704581507
Richie Goulding: he ’ s another.	13671.684730468603
Weighs on his mind.	17932.61452774436
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	15313.531897952069
Dust.	14336.178182593083
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	17451.623842446083
Could do it myself.	12818.243863230015
Save.	9780.093555557632
Was that just when he, she?	11906.369038737414
O, he did.	3978.405330322644
Into her.	15707.401234162882
She did.	4477.979728904703
Done.	10295.660825818126
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	12021.147676471748
O Lord, that little limping devil.	10617.824707978041
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	16702.366946211594
Aftereffect not pleasant.	18227.54902377354
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	12284.096345728107
They don ’ t care.	6438.401581474052
Complimented perhaps.	18679.07077551165
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	14535.259638589
Well, aren ’ t they?	7903.541306622019
See her as she is spoil all.	11584.773246891393
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	12610.12348574233
The name too.	4368.736585389197
_Amours_ of actresses.	18227.54902377354

Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	17724.87334026543
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	13905.662299184823
Still, I feel.	6432.830162842956
The strength it gives a man.	8254.458994756533
That ’ s the secret of it.	3950.8659533542123
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	12945.441837694982
Cider that was.	16807.8688531982

Suppose I spoke to her.	12322.05485053853
What about?	3882.632235786309
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	12852.274605743996
Ask them a question they ask you another.	15551.32576810267
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	10976.9761095864
Gain time.	18679.07077551165
But then you ’ re in a cart.	9265.597595469768
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	13672.735425026382
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	16005.110075004914
All the dirty things I made her say.	9256.092580343853
All wrong of course.	8893.041020542014
My arks she called it.	10028.395122690541
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	5823.849845242317
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	16918.038414933464
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	11729.046757945927
Parrots.	19456.598729469286
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	12219.882518330875
Taking a man from another woman.	15316.311760780676
Or even hear of it.	10855.353746210929
Different with me.	15868.195079096857
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	14477.15478815653
Eating off his cold plate.	16053.975985553223
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	13321.422213424927
French letter still in my pocketbook.	17570.71474456905
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	8581.342302966701
Come in, all is prepared.	10832.068743106935
I dreamt.	3966.4837786130074
What?	694.4811020788688
Worst is beginning.	15868.195079096857
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	12807.88392677955
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	15870.296748191544
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	14035.216958270623
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	14656.950779762443
Because I did.	9281.173607248382
She too.	5630.633660759584
Offend her.	18679.07077551165
Then make it up.	8960.410066068014
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	16627.414130203724
Flatters them.	18679.07077551165
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	10245.648987326205
What harm?	4465.559862111875
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	13900.889489883695
First kiss does the trick.	11876.713105515355
The propitious moment.	5442.1386306936365
Something inside them goes pop.	12505.304740148655
First thoughts are best.	12026.020676764052
Remember that till their dying day.	12691.822129819979
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	13743.549270212954
But her breasts were developed.	9162.5895952032
Fell asleep then.	16807.8688531982
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	13223.144866440914
Featherbed mountain.	18679.07077551165
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	17724.87334026543
Val Dillon.	15251.62811167228
Apoplectic.	19456.598729469286
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	11684.671037793145
My fireworks.	7629.7325899688285
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	14799.503916308087
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	10122.199514742557
Want to be grownups.	7870.922962088746
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	16702.366946211594
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	11682.407576694157
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	9437.438190480141
I knew she could whistle.	7017.687196155772
Mouth made for that.	14932.487582743664
Like Molly.	8356.565255029953
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	12753.175978385696
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	5548.910173631747
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	14806.128056338772
Caressing the little boy too.	17724.87334026543
Onlookers see most of the game.	16702.366946211594
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	10934.597747251064
In their line.	6960.639023770248
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	12123.97285906772
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	9272.484425871433
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	10420.381623811494
Fine eyes she had, clear.	15024.066288223417
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	8089.860400604877
Did she know what I?	10088.464858708681
Course.	11023.48125806745
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	11861.945996985436
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	14568.267574641019
Call that innocence?	12962.219829989945
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	13981.138217281457
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	12348.306388627372
Eyes all over them.	14233.55612654143
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	13777.865327560201
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	17356.98505688499
Sharp as needles they are.	17724.87334026543
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	15000.760830295589
Had, too.	11185.202976064158
Where do they get that?	8708.150170911045
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	16605.326366007845
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	15574.110169387626
Bred in the bone.	16760.897092969924
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	14930.130176133842
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	15171.400766943641
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	13640.771962600591
I never told her.	5222.511736181048
Attract men, small thing like that.	17451.623842446083
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	16937.421557610043
Who did you learn that from?	11191.303795472364
Nobody.	10295.660825818126
Something the nurse taught me.	12505.304740148655
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	11823.952698144067
Me have a nice pace.	13894.212333769912
Mullingar.	9728.691757493107
Who knows?	5202.927699997349
Ways of the world.	14553.80505675568
Young student.	6956.706697141707
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	17279.93518182534
Still she was game.	10263.365675266863
Lord, I am wet.	10904.345319281741
Devil you are.	14632.365267767023
Swell of her calf.	15976.304393411037
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	17451.623842446083
Not like that frump today.	9415.503878915833
A.	707.4051198927579
E.	2132.7942562045123
Rumpled stockings.	15251.62811167228
Or the one in Grafton street.	9782.857468775179
White.	12257.630687766508
Wow! Beef to the heel.	16702.366946211594
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	17451.623842446083
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	13283.510171708489
Will she?	9167.063308793122
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	12651.777888824556
She smelt an onion.	8062.04001836782
Darling, I saw, your.	17570.648302713715
I saw all.	4236.04065718322
Lord! Did me good all the same.	11786.307061160136
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	14477.227779208799
For this relief much thanks.	7394.991357192227
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	10127.440875753313
Lord! It was all things combined.	13241.851363378351
Excitement.	19456.598729469286
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	13453.161653580659
Your head it simply swirls.	6866.464861158549
He ’ s right.	1805.291238846815
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	12944.849812225671
Instead of talking about nothing.	17724.87334026543
Then I will tell you all.	5412.687692652475
Still it was a kind of language between us.	12284.096345728107
It couldn ’ t be?	9064.908611066421
No, Gerty they called her.	7007.233754980379
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	13748.291514056758
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	13588.983380816233
Place made me think of that I suppose.	17356.98505688499
All tarred with the same brush.	10383.476819970887
Wiping pens in their stockings.	17724.87334026543
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	10117.495307583595
Every bullet has its billet.	13292.258639585922
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	14799.503916308087
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	16682.90235283324
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	16103.134453817114
No soft job.	7503.861566893145
Saves them.	18679.07077551165
Nature.	13490.99621301991
Washing child, washing corpse.	16727.42622563514
Dignam.	5397.051392180722
Children ’ s hands always round them.	15762.484269390725
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	16917.697281476372
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	17076.136894926323
Fill it up with wind.	16053.975985553223
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	11937.313751103518
Must call to the hospital.	9667.984509392048
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	10469.69997196562
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	11579.21402151292
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	11988.802468367136
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	11728.996069745788
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	15447.146226617224
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	15870.264746657882
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	14166.242577478062
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	12459.50320710447
Chickens come home to roost.	17724.87334026543
They stick by one another like glue.	10002.26462107063
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	15762.537251106416
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	6271.899231857835
It ’ s the blood of the south.	4386.455573188598
Moorish.	16997.075953601572
Also the form, the figure.	11267.226993935052
Hands felt for the opulent.	10985.405545545558
Just compare for instance those others.	11941.362500301237
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	15337.933878442595
Allow me to introduce my.	17724.87334026543
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	12197.208807911671
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	14433.683963023177
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	13265.203563010718
Have their own secrets between them.	12378.07698206522
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	16959.24882930963
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	13476.884235921232
As God made them he matched them.	11961.781180096463
Twice nought makes one.	16760.897092969924
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	12648.393575507103
Marry in May and repent in December.	16682.90235283324
This wet is very unpleasant.	11475.449325292157
Stuck.	15443.024084639697
Well the foreskin is not back.	11613.36750992003
Better detach.	9134.90617610027
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	15635.953851201202
Long and the short of it.	13777.494126570553
Very strange about my watch.	13292.258639585922
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	17724.87334026543
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	13492.52287173629
Yes, I suppose, at once.	6855.60246666858
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	16654.630702959552
I remember looking in Pill lane.	7162.6727967212
Also that now is magnetism.	12757.329483635987
Back of everything magnetism.	15393.126810427384
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	16667.347011617076
That causes movement.	7294.429475757266
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	11729.274829193948
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	12937.8864915594
Because it ’ s all arranged.	11116.684829105601
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	16218.470450861525
Little piece of steel iron.	13566.671310138481
When you hold out the fork.	10210.65464889659
Come.	2476.0160925037276
Come.	2476.0160925037276
Woman and man that is.	14084.625240398014
Fork and steel.	18227.54902377354
Molly, he.	9158.546770620618
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	16456.640008766462
Tip.	12971.327416137423
Have to let fly.	10014.52106417618
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	11863.193827001947
Shame all put on before third person.	16158.125825015217
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	14225.495121822416
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	14615.206044132088
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	6715.407277920605
Fine voice that fellow had.	14820.693222644375
How Giuglini began.	8340.486826694168
Smell that I did.	15393.126810427384
Like flowers.	8356.565255029953
It was too.	3527.6173276136874
Violets.	19456.598729469286
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	16194.737672074629
Make their own use of everything.	13905.662299184823
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	13746.740021104522
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	11202.364703907815
Keep that thing up for hours.	13351.61319840644
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	14110.070470831886
Wait.	1374.254002664509
Hm. Hm. Yes.	11036.86830694513
That ’ s her perfume.	3465.8609307746915
Why she waved her hand.	10277.587600275956
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	11980.303499578466
What is it?	1868.65751089726
Heliotrope?	19456.598729469286
No. Hyacinth?	4210.363634038203
Hm. Roses, I think.	10381.417056866681
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	8117.723958312471
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	15024.066288223417
Why Molly likes opoponax.	9495.175603444217
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	17356.98505688499
Her high notes and her low notes.	11155.413992935575
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	11139.738340955193
Heat brought it out.	16760.897092969924
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	10731.80176140479
Good conductor, is it?	9307.330110028888
Or bad?	7919.7548350386605
Light too.	12825.524320071201
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	13447.298601703531
Mysterious thing too.	16807.8688531982
Why did I smell it only now?	8454.485596112016
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	17162.064257603583
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	13652.93042251717
Yes, it is.	2762.6760716124836
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	14009.405615860669
Tell you what it is.	12584.91489690827
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	12729.540085750657
Clings to everything she takes off.	17570.648302713715

How do you sniff?	5476.0665176468365
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	12782.576057409786
Yes now, look at it that way.	11308.844977055931
We ’ re the same.	6422.275620643456
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	14696.805278900903
Come near.	8442.157317374053
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	12169.538100189837
Like what?	8356.565255029953
Potted herrings gone stale or.	16727.42622563514
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	17451.623842446083

What though?	5310.3952380902765
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	17162.064257603583

What you eat and drink gives that.	9012.732443938196
No. Mansmell, I mean.	6270.3934613412675
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different.	11687.397703014307

Never went back and the soap not paid.	13001.446875985599
Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning.	15837.412554638748
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.	16194.737672074629

My native land, goodnight.	10626.382741620842

Also the library today: those girl graduates.	12164.596163482147
Happy chairs under them.	15393.126810427384
But it ’ s the evening influence.	8643.962232772536
They feel all that.	8324.989829218672
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.	15921.852001036057
Nightstock in Mat Dillon ’ s garden where I kissed her shoulder.	17116.08905700508

Tired I feel now.	16760.897092969924
Will I get up?	10246.837351146041
Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch.	17215.988293285944
She kissed me.	5049.225352572128
Never again.	9070.866143451834
My youth.	7629.7325899688285

Or hers.	7919.7548350386605
Take the train there tomorrow.	13056.812122290823
No. Returning not the same.	7031.247214851891

Are you not happy in your?	5490.242308819641
Naughty darling.	16878.573427268955
At Dolphin ’ s barn charades in Luke Doyle ’ s house.	12337.537660665772
Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty.	16917.697281476372

Eightyseven that was.	18227.54902377354
Year before we.	14632.276751995785
Curious she an only child, I an only child.	15337.933878442595
So it returns.	8166.976190181595
Think you ’ re escaping and run into yourself.	13639.39925911871
Longest way round is the shortest way home.	17356.98505688499
And just when he and she.	8316.024845207783
Circus horse walking in a ring.	17570.648302713715
Rip van Winkle we played.	16727.42622563514
Rip: tear in Henny Doyle ’ s overcoat.	16654.630702959552
Van: breadvan delivering.	16760.897092969924
Winkle: cockles and periwinkles.	17724.87334026543
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	10255.999294350813
She leaned on the sideboard watching.	9170.204549206652
Moorish eyes.	16878.573427268955
Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.	13777.233724294932
All changed.	6523.269050754646
Forgotten.	11785.351918411056
The young are old.	4929.512522098421
His gun rusty from the dew.	10004.661937286033
Ba. What is that flying about?	14236.836215693105
Swallow?	19456.598729469286
Thinks I ’ m a tree, so blind.	16225.156050121535
Have birds no smell?	11240.806478243678
Metempsychosis.	19456.598729469286
They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief.	11673.841735529419
Weeping willow.	18679.07077551165
Ba. There he goes.	12874.881442835474
Funny little beggar.	14188.216383417554
Wonder where he lives.	11079.13719112889
Belfry up there.	18227.54902377354
Very likely.	11288.406558228855
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	15898.98236476088
Bell scared him out, I suppose.	14960.60122188506
Mass seems to be over.	17724.87334026543
Could hear them all at it.	12984.245195345893
Pray for us.	11389.746605509446
And pray for us.	5047.697639015613
And pray for us.	5047.697639015613
Good idea the repetition.	8361.05353383158
Same thing with ads.	11852.580428062383
Buy from us.	15175.67984183378
And buy from us.	7424.17538465336

Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom ’ s.	13767.887287207352
Twentyeight it is.	15175.67984183378
Two houses they have.	10841.848074037694
Gabriel Conroy ’ s brother is curate.	17451.623842446083
Ba. Again.	12634.790248621277
Wonder why they come out at night like mice.	12807.368717479292
They ’ re a mixed breed.	7859.007635772994
Birds are like hopping mice.	15550.35106674391
What frightens them, light or noise?	9978.5550117665
Better sit still.	10285.071939094505
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	13957.585658766926
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	12437.626304168945
Weeny bones.	18679.07077551165
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.	15950.473344786498
Colours depend on the light you see.	16682.90235283324
Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	16937.421557610043
Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.	16224.754514648872
Colour of brown turf.	17932.61452774436
Not true.	7341.9588068610365
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	12687.744672569666
Body fifty different colours.	15976.304393411037
Howth a while ago amethyst.	16053.975985553223
Glass flashing.	14855.255256694101
That ’ s how that wise man what ’ s his name with the burning glass.	8606.645771603316
Then the heather goes on fire.	8347.347698626627
It can ’ t be tourists ’ matches.	10854.799503003123
What?	694.4811020788688
Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.	12715.780284509303
Archimedes.	19456.598729469286
I have it! My memory ’ s not so bad.	8419.845886643589
Ba. Who knows what they ’ re always flying for.	14905.792046337874
Insects?	19456.598729469286
Might be the one bit me, come back to see.	12240.363214478213
Birds too.	14855.255256694101
Never find out.	10227.348794111555
Or what they say.	10120.794185173527
Like our small talk.	10489.593069935356
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	17215.988293285944
Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.	16224.754514648872
Dreadful life sailors have too.	16053.975985553223
Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	15052.672631492973
_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	16392.344422341943
Married too.	14855.255256694101
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	16271.194396303015
No ends really because it ’ s round.	11136.63209209529
Wife in every port they say.	14045.279128905344
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	11636.550764153795
If ever he does.	9105.127897804052
Smelling the tail end of ports.	17570.648302713715
How can they like the sea?	9884.433285732286
Yet they do.	11089.997094238553
The anchor ’ s weighed.	7475.025159920183
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	15568.88640064323
Well.	5119.018575483811
And the tephilim no what ’ s this they call it poor papa ’ s father had on his door to touch.	11919.508265484077
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	10236.89260447874
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	14263.390940228262
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	16187.79204847829
Do fish ever get seasick?	11071.338356944703
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones ’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	14479.55787981471
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	11015.802066113903
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	13658.345967112855
They floated, fell: they faded.	10463.152996270252
The shepherd ’ s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	11680.312421563716
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	15336.979690275934
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	12836.93644449451
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	15535.372228077407
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	17356.98505688499
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	14952.776431758835
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	16426.29359661347
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	12095.37417351807
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	12242.800530707946
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	15241.931200093528

Filthy trip.	16878.573427268955
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	17451.623842446083
Puking overboard to feed the herrings.	17570.648302713715
Nausea.	19456.598729469286
And the women, fear of God in their faces.	8595.956012895713
Milly, no sign of funk.	13659.238031252198
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	11172.584058815377
Don ’ t know what death is at that age.	8504.683541829823
And then their stomachs clean.	6241.9030668608275
But being lost they fear.	8646.975272954956
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	11890.135247596729
I didn ’ t want to.	4814.9639776906315
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	16005.110075004943
Frightening them with masks too.	17724.87334026543
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	17280.03022561515
I ’ ll murder you.	2877.728221529232
Is it only half fun?	9137.558776019976
Or children playing battle.	10120.794185173527
Whole earnest.	15707.401234162882
How can people aim guns at each other.	10519.562260102815
Sometimes they go off.	15976.304393411037
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	13075.894838502207
After getting better asleep with Molly.	12161.93492434831
Very same teeth she has.	13292.258639585922
What do they love?	4757.2884212059025
Another themselves?	11935.765987958684
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	9253.775485201239
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	13659.496273594901
I felt her pulse.	6828.996811279133
Ticking.	19456.598729469286
Little hand it was: now big.	14175.167266912102
All that the hand says when you touch.	9920.194381945339
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	17570.648302713715
Her first stays I remember.	9970.211575772451
Made me laugh to see.	14298.038131759304
Little paps to begin with.	13566.671310138481
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	14055.361862727814
Nearer the heart?	18227.54902377354
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	12730.413840836669
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	17215.988293285944
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	13357.381123676254
Brings back her girlhood.	15393.126810427384

Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.	15898.98236476088
I always thought I ’ d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht.	12678.307644458693
_Buenas noches, señorita.	17932.704941932887

Why me?	7196.881458368225
Because you were so foreign from the others.	12385.444577430444
Better not stick here all night like a limpet.	12257.594875202525
This weather makes you dull.	11475.449325292157
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	9984.069689023885
Go home.	9886.219821179826
Too late for _Leah, Lily of <URL> No. Might be still up.	13554.562096455196

Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan ’ s.	10680.486843591147
Got my own back there.	12357.336220593894
Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince.	17162.064257603583
Mistake to hit back.	15976.304393411037
Or?	6197.390787671949
No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.	9348.925089377948
Always want to be swilling in company.	13590.163994936875
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	15637.633581627138
Suppose he hit me.	11184.227952078181
Look at it other way round.	9863.784091456464
Not so bad then.	8572.63060502773
Perhaps not to hurt he meant.	13659.238031252198
Three cheers for Israel.	10217.588402386367
Three cheers for the sister - in - law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	14307.507713449566
Same style of beauty.	9045.348566796
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.	17279.9827036549
The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.	11869.292484251426
Imagine that in the early morning at close range.	16224.754514648872
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow.	15651.083591364084
But Dignam ’ s put the boots on it.	11354.881947633154
Anyhow she wants the money.	14298.161685211302
Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	11749.548196732734
Strange name.	14855.255256694101
Takes it for granted we ’ re going to pop off first.	16627.450058802373
That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer ’ s that looked at me.	12479.763840804859
Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium.	17215.988293285944
Her widow ’ s mite.	10564.729742187508
Well?	3501.394758727052
What do you expect her to do?	6838.656714116577
Must wheedle her way along.	10855.353746210929
Widower I hate to see.	16727.42622563514
Looks so forlorn.	13211.596235347006

What ’ s that?	1863.4469429659339
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	9685.010044686069
He brought it near his eyes and peered.	9132.26302191336
Letter?	14336.178182593083
No. Can ’ t read.	6683.787020758161
Better go.	9134.90617610027
Better.	5721.0475848644
I ’ m tired to move.	3465.1696038167643
Page of an old copybook.	17724.87334026543
All those holes and pebbles.	8124.348252465776
Who could count them?	9185.182546630816
Never know what you find.	10026.967463976394

What ’ s this?	3570.3584827904947
Bit of stick.	13492.701411031798
O! Exhausted that female has me.	10150.123243652823
Not so young now.	8572.63060502773
Will she come here tomorrow?	11801.582919903063
Wait for her somewhere for ever.	11258.18523005866
Murderers do.	18679.07077551165
Will I?	8068.162039475805
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	9001.079953211043
Write a message for her.	15550.35106674391
Might remain.	10037.653318628356

Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning.	12227.189690638354
Useless.	13490.99621301991
Washed away.	18679.07077551165
Tide comes here.	16807.8688531982
Saw a pool near her foot.	15316.311760780676
Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	16609.827111563896
All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	11786.919011484611
O, those transparent! Besides they don ’ t know.	8757.443986034768
What is the meaning of that other world.	7334.753217803568
I called you naughty boy because I do not like.	6476.767562616231

No room.	6159.577739645505
Let it go.	9870.706736569753
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	7974.302743653984
Hopeless thing sand.	18227.54902377354
Nothing grows in it.	13127.503305506403

Round the Kish in eighty days.	13497.317468726236
Done half by design.	14932.487582743664
He flung his wooden pen away.	7386.524262608318
Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn ’ t.	13130.882419447484
Chance.	19456.598729469286
We ’ ll never meet again.	7665.057766424512
But it was lovely.	5365.708142313457
Goodbye, dear.	13492.701411031798
Thanks.	6408.290829423725

Liverpool boat long gone.	16760.897092969924
Not even the smoke.	8572.63060502773
And she can do the other.	7514.518770844437
Did too.	8532.331730453821
And Belfast.	4975.7915955385515
I won ’ t go.	6512.468296748575
Race there, race back to Ennis.	17451.623842446083
Let him.	7296.747284592717
Just close my eyes a moment.	11941.362500301237
Won ’ t sleep, though.	11416.167041663473
Half dream.	12198.155126919923
It never comes the same.	7748.343779523997
Bat again.	18679.07077551165

Far in the grey a bell chimed.	14301.750232150835
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	9901.528377654797
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest ’ s house cooed where Canon O ’ Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	11371.10543660745

Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	15162.435549686497

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	16201.431970218806
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	16227.082300984212
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	13874.574044321498
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O ’ Shiels, the O ’ Hickeys, the O ’ Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	15526.321850106206
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	16499.49342056517
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	15750.755326836894
O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt! Before born bliss babe had.	15331.518007628178
Within womb won he worship.	17724.87334026543

A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.	15821.961973294485
Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night ’ s oncoming.	14696.805278900903
Of Israel ’ s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared.	14242.649257079933
Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.	17076.136894926323
Of that house A.	10841.848074037694
Horne is lord.	16807.8688531982
Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God ’ s angel to Mary quoth.	16799.833052722297
Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless.	17215.988293285944
Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred.	17076.136894926323
Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.	17162.064257603583
In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid.	13938.946888828472
Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland ’ s westward welkin.	17115.978107251347
Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	15668.659617637279
Christ ’ s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	16055.49472461643
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne ’ s house.	10221.191828593126
Loth to irk in Horne ’ s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	16620.902031955746
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	14312.146769722945
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	15153.994240877531
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.	14778.481969877577
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	15372.70361169995
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	13426.024736923484
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	15110.407360269339
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	14889.155551529033
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	15474.368965932657
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	14155.584351555344
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	14136.987697288834
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	14317.94547967673
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	9811.431323648321
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	13226.800635340822
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	16553.276193289486
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	12381.20625022233
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	13978.911982559648
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	13636.253909105277
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	13944.746094925997
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	14388.870839533294
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	15316.311760780676
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	13923.42892057581
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	10672.09415239071
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	14726.751212056099
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	11733.173236898681
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	10863.98928409841
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	14870.170786736779
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	13540.328991029804
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	12271.391851597878
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	13742.406500099421
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	14406.530366087378
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	13614.481829185499
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	13149.643996654671
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	14072.78336735226
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	13811.383349303196
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	14954.56531905493
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	13525.470060137533
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	12222.976432509638
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	15096.369648460877
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	10396.71488624163
Thanked be Almighty God.	17932.61452774436
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	15595.965055479035
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	16007.938791685945
Meseems it dureth overlong.	17932.61452774436
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	14203.742393054104
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	13613.279121241789
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	10418.401591886975
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	16019.51241569455
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	14929.316622224815
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	13336.925194556527
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	14572.181645070721
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	15461.450860441597
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	14538.294797485198
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	17010.718138155575
For they were right witty scholars.	10535.337865370506
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	14923.768294121344
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	14296.673141146266
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	14819.177887156371
A redress God grant.	7210.75792986819
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	14718.295571565248
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	15021.507798712591
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	15460.155524496986
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	13852.163253960412
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	15475.26057588501
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	13693.485871236198
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	12926.126864639642
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	12014.16307499795
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	12459.50320710447
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	14277.93543510425
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	16547.56267755353
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	16557.55040162807
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	15919.940659746831
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	15117.512263981156
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	14243.591247669685
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	15577.18290385823
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	12317.202065216901
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	15347.364835347535
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	15495.243597072173
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	15779.163684648416
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	16230.956581340897
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	15176.38583998711
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	16627.414130203724
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	15107.561934002502
See ye here.	10014.333916917605
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	12800.34076809765
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	12857.582574382095
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions.	14163.338893038497
What means this?	6664.161869368329
Desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	16583.598455514977
Mark me now.	14632.365267767023
In woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	14504.234547735161
This is the postcreation.	6702.189766001146
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	11816.888630436475
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	15736.691008029158
But here is the matter now.	9863.782630541877
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	15856.956016372498
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l ’ avait mise dans cette fichue position c ’ était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	16029.878006796864
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	10374.235088188594
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	13433.542090814786
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	12772.74602198075
With will will we withstand, withsay.	11586.250331273503
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	16605.21462369035
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	15802.500316485328
In Horne ’ s house rest should reign.	11169.894951601224
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	15279.374215736281
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	16296.050166275516
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	12553.53661996152
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	16545.35446444823
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	14874.240651807
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	15033.844767831242
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	15428.208431339455
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	15774.55322438036
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	16589.662823457256
Go thou and do likewise.	13056.812122290823

Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	16588.441933508395

Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	16687.364500142856
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn ’ s bivouac.	16339.320986773206
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	12109.68920124338
Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	16635.086093072554
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	16194.737672074629
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	13639.643040456904
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	14496.565189538584
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	14962.860609184823
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	13049.49874617879
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	12287.286749486771
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	15425.363165188252
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	12550.45116787083
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	12242.800530707946
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	9448.397276810847
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	13915.36814380216
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	17162.064257603583
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	15964.705037273485
Heard?	14336.178182593083
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	13762.206087272118
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	15085.179251229509
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	11680.271297480844
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	14891.656269162853
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	15423.996319777354
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	15284.47898790135
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	15848.763190459038
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	15156.163362332714
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	16551.959224230694
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	10584.962188229216
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	16067.73096770657
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	15615.430121839754
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	13554.02844792014
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	13864.988444088043
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	15872.22492338306
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	15232.34869412214
Over against the Rt. Hon.	13840.059309081189
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon ’ s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal.	13442.260827554377
Mulligan a gentleman ’ s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore ’ s the writer ’ s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	16215.626836422636
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	16597.877092072595
There Leop.	6944.695736638025

Leop.	19456.598729469286
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	16120.457918577902
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	15645.723026721584
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	15644.125720010865
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	15899.044270705042
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	15829.16768509283
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	12445.903151375382
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	14735.9961867112
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	11399.474372883878
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	16156.781463595395
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	13507.273720420417
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	14071.265077169799
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	16767.622055241918
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	15732.035009842255
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	13549.94612436938
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	13226.246255838176
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	10842.267008088513
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	7684.522644614551
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	14358.333561956266
I question with you there, says he.	7418.735935387496
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	14404.453982122528
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	15059.106644067608
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	10741.141275813989
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	15837.465753404915
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	9168.899524577077
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	13210.889234580782
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	15878.382856857701
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	13796.916968457623
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	14347.594300499157
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	14950.532349343475
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	15195.91464588145
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	16092.268297619306
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	14830.174979312564
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	15564.527983105614
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	15812.158364949835
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	14988.263598681606
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	13742.357786860463
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	9968.381889778737
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	15689.996678786223
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	14778.639815269322
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	15685.753666276685
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	13831.419899570157
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	15620.912003549101
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	15220.646235678762
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	15020.373158717704
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	16565.54606196129
Fertiliser and Incubator.	18227.54902377354
Lambay Island_.	18679.07077551165
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	15205.115215594433
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	11961.951573156224
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	9725.28344188899
Come, be seated, both.	9933.20106246528
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	12260.336569815761
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	15434.581552215315
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	15719.767265154887
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	15744.261052037547
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	15118.382946364864
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	16007.95050794767
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	14102.59878300253
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	15610.82023154916
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	15270.08875152301
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	15052.426732405022
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	14912.964944943587
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	15734.91087060415
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	16687.364500142856
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	13077.575763714854
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	14747.733574016693
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	15738.405155306007
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	15423.764318467049
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	15580.331965866235
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	14655.21627173996
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	12686.788932497191
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	16205.076268057923
That you may and very opportunely.	9912.933555173273
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	12379.352905285228
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	14999.973796429116
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	15594.632721235306
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	16608.558392688556
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	10769.834561348183
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	13981.01900248695
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	13836.496883914851
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	16675.72271955882
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	11715.752585062013
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	12111.757483278727
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	17570.648302713715
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	15358.453921245286
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	12691.41337369894
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	15428.725867103316
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	16645.65090549937
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	13921.563639447637
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	17279.93518182534
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	9484.074403340821
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	14077.182436748086
No woman of any wit would wear one.	11136.5984024571
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	14346.48019912092
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	14261.650415350157
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	16463.382786083777
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	14598.113244792496
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	16620.767957823315
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	12535.845891624904
What, you dog?	6292.515181937445
Have you a way with them?	8460.776951798958
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	17162.064257603583
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	16420.10067172162
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	14496.569518650485
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	12678.326821197368
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	13173.608184067336
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	16748.064491463207
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	14069.01900481543
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	13664.849043461705
I cannot away with them.	7312.073031248824
What?	694.4811020788688
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	16854.733822291528
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	11807.063188321174
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	16731.458499012577
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	15710.498137002467
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	15438.736939486173
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	16668.10176834287
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	15358.148006617057
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	14689.663429393995
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	15384.623513808101
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	15194.840043622145
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	15851.114936726972
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	15789.42490310235
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	15696.537465777621
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	16335.40799889971
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	13894.362119521531
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	14523.141164221726
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	11865.10351057293
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	13996.902389413946
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	12129.469183608124
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	15501.5906181598
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	16642.31826937899
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	13841.481394932216
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	14848.332265261635
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	10702.61090361418
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	16426.134464000417
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	13210.91700613165
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	14655.374590213385
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	16148.155231880733
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	16782.713263309317
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	15675.333822217246
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	10854.766665942077
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	14559.44852367518
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	11806.6217827892
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	14537.491228225557
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	12859.123317686288
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	15445.521571753077
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	14567.890190309445
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	15841.767567081662
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	13269.35318549944
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	12893.569113491236
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	16437.26562807607
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	15517.03111430081
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	14525.185608767573
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	15854.017602600898
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	10403.972071259352
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	14097.514530892513
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	16678.498770647893
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	16678.47074066458
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	11715.723050432365
He conjured up the scene before them.	8943.670073404995
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	11921.284113977003
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	15893.992408676077
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	12942.193564769092
Yes, it is true.	4489.1620325232
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	5889.945741084332
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	11680.271297480844
This is the appearance is on me.	9054.91924745598
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	16717.194562448527
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	13252.654600249321
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	8791.098059387296
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	16819.419911419274
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	9901.227051867112
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	13571.31351989689
He was gone.	3087.6722977964214
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	17279.9827036549
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	12981.943553260058
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	9691.383318478305
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	17451.623842446083
The mystery was unveiled.	6549.046155587141
Haines was the third brother.	12429.55752372533
His real name was Childs.	8293.712399653603
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	9224.439503818816
He drank drugs to obliterate.	6156.262994553694
For this relief much thanks.	7394.991357192227
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	9484.074403340821
No soul will live there.	9402.998833779971
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	9484.074403340821
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	8916.453222764361
A curse is on it.	8117.899790053171
It is haunted.	4121.264694190491
Murderer ’ s ground.	11395.735728287644
What is the age of the soul of man?	8410.61513417393
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	15368.263661380908
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	14715.973624648102
A score of years are blown away.	9507.376927886024
He is young Leopold.	4238.372012657158
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	14155.557293037331
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	15133.57111662225
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	16071.227531814682
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	14261.650415350157
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	13230.594840883123
Who can say?	8856.801548293877
The wise father knows his own child.	8916.453222764361
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	12460.448900576182
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	16697.386171804
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	16868.487024965427
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	13411.072706351197
Did heart leap to heart?	11327.475203452446
Nay, fair reader.	12817.856236227119
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	13470.06438921993
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	10666.396972892604
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	11172.774148947972
No, Leopold.	4187.3801131182
Name and memory solace thee not.	15316.253852478543
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	12800.037726503133
No son of thy loins is by thee.	10694.112456422476
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	12033.708217323709
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	14164.891817900729
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	13745.707775302102
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	12402.52646245979
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	16277.97127148087
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	11370.092057475593
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	16092.93502372126
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	16005.110075004914
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	12722.735097524337
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	16883.448887228955
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	16819.419911419274
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	16462.118310399717
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	16883.448887228955
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	13122.322260587398
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	13142.727156446737
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	12054.064355493372
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	14636.06378813522
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	15577.65283240513
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	16594.209823215468
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	8677.530799275153
Where were they now?	8958.518971959285
Neither knew.	15707.401234162882
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	8655.225158567682
Why think of them?	9495.175603444217
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	12949.121789487974
Who supposes it?	8856.801548293877
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	11341.650006038371
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	11700.354052510578
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	14798.467525560134
All who wish you well hope this for you.	11786.919011484611
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	13443.023813949167
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	9725.28344188899
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	13076.039016754632
Have no fear.	10406.696869514783
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	8873.31402467306
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	7462.30098180377
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	13957.62404316867
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	11257.05113224154
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	16096.040264337387
He told them of the race.	6587.225853823649
Madden up.	10471.917594461911
She was leading the field.	6526.704500051683
All hearts were beating.	8893.041020542014
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	13549.539159002346
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	14646.708604785277
All was lost now.	8893.041020542014
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	17279.93518182534
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	17356.98505688499
A tear fell: one only.	8872.392851107246
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	10916.959647895632
Lane.	16997.075953601572
Four winners yesterday and three today.	14559.54209314761
What rider is like him?	8638.7839666994
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	16360.520292583835
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	11715.723050432365
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	16614.986150192934
She is not the filly that she was.	9353.130081130901
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	13741.82595912381
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	12542.829052200714
Do you remember her, Vincent?	7794.859193986449
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	10993.359043553544
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	14946.50263694895
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	13113.231882101858
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	13435.878332362894
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	13648.6009949864
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	14237.475837519265
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	12551.65910578845
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	16564.556915817044
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	14036.915039844454
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	14304.754280062592
But he had been kind.	6317.916493342022
In going by he had blessed us.	10693.844815858989
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	8617.699696327858
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	12318.447347586556
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	12249.434665592953
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	17279.93518182534
His soul is far away.	9312.301015802657
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	10985.290365586352
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	15370.121325159662
Do you not think it, Stephen?	8864.219740219132
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	16868.593329825293
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	14433.938566281175
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	15452.07244353764
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	14635.151061443443
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	16448.900352827925
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	14555.407179166628
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	16606.780898321118
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	12338.421226245811
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	16194.737672074629
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	12840.236241342713
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	13779.677229086681
A gallant scene in truth it made.	9507.376927886024
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	16184.593303981
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	14214.460369973827
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	16286.529656887402
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	14790.24042586171
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	16497.733325675046
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	13529.072148238236
Dedalus ’ (Div.	11955.37773549704
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	15965.673082732812
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	12531.2773066555
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	14461.364204911355
Bloom (Pubb.	5894.451129548218
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	15471.08610868493
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	15874.972639762063
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	15616.094640059213
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	10911.995599091695
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	12779.664816499853
Mr M.	5858.297839120242
Mulligan (Hyg.	14188.216383417554
et Eug.	18679.07077551165
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	16264.453858635363
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	15837.412554638748
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	16119.265920033238
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	16637.66840380284
Mr J.	5858.297839120242
Crotthers (Disc.	16807.8688531982
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	16651.04142234494
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	16742.235951354596
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	14918.148403752602
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	13145.402388803657
Lynch (Bacc.	12536.44797527997
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	16636.22151300399
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	15370.678421704224
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	16443.617752992115
Mr S.	5858.297839120242
Dedalus ’ (Div.	11955.37773549704
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	16395.04403265387
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	15564.253140798566
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	9131.738578061542
Bloom (Pubb.	5894.451129548218
Canv.) which took place in the commons ’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	13932.58058776278

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	14264.66614537475
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	16819.419911419274
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	12240.762386237866
She had.	3298.0087056925368
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	10467.051722957134
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	15332.375658751524
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	16675.72271955882
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	14567.194932789556
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	13785.348994650332
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	14923.475487254167
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	16089.083503979802
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	15703.287190189618
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	11289.241543221808
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	10458.297654585316
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	15315.0423187723
He knows and will call in His own good time.	9199.520478138898
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	12392.439278540076
Sir, to you my hand.	14198.982637419229
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	15564.42683744594
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	14048.244108574692
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	16116.18002177765
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	15142.829094829058
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	14967.330496358592
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	14760.353249132208
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	15233.051899958287
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	15516.034934776166
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	14760.353249132208
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	15000.614902221545
Mark this farther and remember.	15150.622186653598

I should not have parted with my talisman.	8873.85254842382
Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my time of life.	16342.016510695657
Every phenomenon has a natural cause.	13659.238031252198
THE FAN: _ (Points downwards slowly.) _ You may.	9608.968439206681
BLOOM: _ (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace.) _ We are observed.	6571.499135886833
BLOOM: _ (With desire, with reluctance.) _ I can make a true black knot.	7298.410636158831
Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellett ’ s.	16983.53434559331
Experienced hand.	18679.07077551165
Every knot says a lot.	13292.258639585922
Let me.	4356.149614557594
In courtesy.	6205.486629649666
I knelt once before today.	7748.087875888077
Ah! _ (Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.	14048.973400692099
Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.) _ BLOOM: _ (Murmurs lovingly.) _ To be a shoefitter in Manfield ’ s was my love ’ s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies.	13940.70267582596
Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.	15509.780610390162
THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide.	10763.07312718139
Feel my royal weight.	12434.469980118545
BLOOM: _ (Crosslacing.) _ Too tight?	4387.655114990538
THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I ’ ll kick your football for you.	13626.983279147784
BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance.	10314.759617086767
Bad luck.	10571.668153790324
Hook in wrong tache of her...	16005.110075004943

That night she met...	9912.933555173273

Bella places her foot on the floor.	14058.736114091043
Bloom raises his head.	9622.355479913587
Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow.	12730.413840836669
His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.) _ BLOOM: _ (Mumbles.) _ Awaiting your further orders we remain, gentlemen,...	11238.6755250175
BELLO: _ (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) _ Hound of dishonour! BLOOM: _ (Infatuated.) _ Empress! BELLO: _ (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) _ Adorer of the adulterous rump! BLOOM: _ (Plaintively.) _ Hugeness! BELLO: Dungdevourer! BLOOM: _ (With sinews semiflexed.) _ Magmagnificence! BELLO: Down! _ (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) _ Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall.	13484.293347146
You are falling.	5022.029242634989
On the hands down! BLOOM: _ (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.) _ Truffles! _ (With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.) _ BELLO: _ (With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer ’ s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock ’ s feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) _ Footstool! Feel my entire weight.	14835.975198309972
Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot ’ s glorious heels so glistening in their proud erectness.	16899.786054421136
BLOOM: _ (Enthralled, bleats.) _ I promise never to disobey.	6481.625102370835
BELLO: _ (Laughs loudly.) _ Holy smoke! You little know what ’ s in store for you.	10944.456981506863
I ’ m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I ’ ll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son.	11030.06383441981
Cheek me, I dare you.	17570.648302713715
If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.	11695.589639086267

FLORRY: _ (Hiding her with her gown.) _ She didn ’ t mean it, Mr Bello.	12779.120738784233
She ’ ll be good, sir.	7501.095950531038
KITTY: Don ’ t be too hard on her, Mr Bello.	13689.446966268182
Sure you won ’ t, ma ’ amsir.	14928.333337451659
BELLO: _ (Coaxingly.) _ Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction.	11949.33033118493
_ (Bloom puts out her timid head.) _ There ’ s a good girly now.	8693.252440496011
_ (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) _ I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot.	11934.928895231084
How ’ s that tender behind?	6644.311745866911
O, ever so gently, pet.	7225.843428628289
Begin to get ready.	14387.339559964428
BLOOM: _ (Fainting.) _ Don ’ t tear my...	6179.116246319474
BELLO: _ (Savagely.) _ The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I ’ ll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old.	13021.901660682825
You ’ re in for it this time! I ’ ll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life.	11271.299939286571
_ (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) _ I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson ’ s fat hamrashers and a bottle of Guinness ’ s porter.	12502.522884538135
_ (He belches.) _ And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the _Licensed Victualler ’ s Gazette_.	9511.356887614806
Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce.	15909.683423826305
It will hurt you.	7665.507817060794
_ (He twists her arm.	2743.2441183373653
Bloom squeals, turning turtle.) _ BLOOM: Don ’ t be cruel, nurse! Don ’ t! BELLO: _ (Twisting.) _ Another! BLOOM: _ (Screams.) _ O, it ’ s hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad! BELLO: _ (Shouts.) _ Good, by the rumping jumping general! That ’ s the best bit of news I heard these six weeks.	13100.597862686112
Here, don ’ t keep me waiting, damn you! _ (He slaps her face.) _ BLOOM: _ (Whimpers.) _ You ’ re after hitting me.	11362.22990288155
BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.	12261.322647117795
ZOE: Yes.	5226.063201062929
FLORRY: I will.	10013.81478956162
Don ’ t be greedy.	5606.461580686876
KITTY: No, me.	11694.990620493016
Lend him to me.	15665.739701619705
_ (The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men ’ s grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.) _ MRS KEOGH: _ (Ferociously.) _ Can I help?	13320.19646076179
_ (They hold and pinion Bloom.) _ BELLO: _ (Squats with a grunt on Bloom ’ s upturned face, puffing cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg.) _ I see Keating Clay is elected vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness ’ s preference shares are at sixteen three quarters.	12898.21784510784
Curse me for a fool that didn ’ t buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about.	16360.520292583835
Just my infernal luck, curse it.	12380.524395892233
And that Goddamned outsider _Throwaway_ at twenty to one.	8747.73801329095
_ (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom ’ s ear.) _ Where ’ s that Goddamned cursed ashtray?	8347.500601271442
BLOOM: _ (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) _ O! O! Monsters! Cruel one! BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes.	9322.109736923623
Beg.	19456.598729469286
Pray for it as you never prayed before.	13720.412963750789
_ (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) _ Here, kiss that.	7627.679057776115
Both.	10426.63014497102
_ (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman ’ s knees, calls in a hard voice.) _ Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross.	10576.590178443303
I ’ ll ride him for the Eclipse stakes.	5433.901805930628
_ (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount ’ s testicles roughly, shouting.) _ Ho! Off we pop! I ’ ll nurse you in proper fashion.	10613.368746086455
_ (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the, in the saddle.) _ The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.	11585.546378067882
You had enough.	6356.708046186521
I asked before you.	5686.505441203406
ZOE: _ (Pulling at Florry.) _ Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?	10877.92284940069
BLOOM: _ (Stifling.) _ Can ’ t.	4565.153129238686
BELLO: Well, I ’ m not.	9087.027964871399
Wait.	1374.254002664509
_ (He holds in his breath.) _ Curse it.	5636.790854190567

This bung ’ s about burst.	12010.913107149021
_ (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) _ Take that! _ (He recorks himself.) _ Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.	11054.237613100991
BLOOM: _ (A sweat breaking out over him.) _ Not man.	6328.434153612084
_ (He sniffs.) _ Woman.	3340.629554817919
BELLO: _ (Stands up.) _ No more blow hot and cold.	9458.864279437787
What you longed for has come to pass.	9576.192356838512
Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke.	17041.351916654137
Now for your punishment frock.	11327.475203452446
You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen?	11288.942077713229
and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders.	14698.406510497656
And quickly too! BLOOM: _ (Shrinks.) _ Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tiptouch it with my nails?	12898.354314158409
BELLO: _ (Points to his whores.) _ As they are now so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits.	11992.126453425175
Tape measurements will be taken next your skin.	17356.98505688499
You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice.	15234.602995114516
Alice will feel the pullpull.	17724.87334026543
Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...	15589.171164900257
BLOOM: _ (A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large male hands and nose, leering mouth.) _ I tried her things on only twice, a small prank, in Holles street.	11023.349615832176
When we were hard up I washed them to save the laundry bill.	13269.807756367676
My own shirts I turned.	10626.382741620842
It was the purest thrift.	5098.380094974872
BELLO: _ (Jeers.) _ Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh?	9978.64138830493
And showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat ’ s udders in various poses of surrender, eh?	14083.347256261633
Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel, eh?	16077.771413712302

_ (He guffaws again.) _ Christ, wouldn ’ t it make a Siamese cat laugh?	8022.9078415564845
BLOOM: _ (Her hands and features working.) _ It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play _Vice Versa_.	10386.020583118701
He got that kink, fascinated by sister ’ s stays.	10472.110899071193
Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids.	13258.756054091938
Cult of the beautiful.	17932.61452774436
BELLO: _ (With wicked glee.) _ Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.	12690.56531787657
BLOOM: Science.	3164.613181888742
To compare the various joys we each enjoy.	11878.249414500327
_ (Earnestly.) _ And really it ’ s better the position...	8349.472095791542
because often I used to wet...	17356.98505688499
BELLO: _ (Sternly.) _ No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the corner for you.	10160.442305292796
I gave you strict instructions, didn ’ t I?	9516.177218221083
Do it standing, sir! I ’ ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles.	14519.79686021418
Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you ’ ll find I ’ m a martinet.	15130.050513321648
The sins of your past are rising against you.	9975.267020722324
Many.	12815.418782069682
Hundreds.	19456.598729469286
THE SINS OF THE PAST: _ (In a medley of voices.) _ He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black church.	14819.467092039276
Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in D ’ Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox.	16809.303462704516
By word and deed he frankly encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises.	14707.03737499666
In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males.	13294.655584727132
And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see?	13663.392732625809
Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?	14732.934299876826
BELLO: _ (Whistles loudly.) _ Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime?	11806.589152921932
Go the whole hog.	12553.74482835707
Puke it out! Be candid for once.	17356.98505688499

His bangle bracelets fall.) _ BELLO: _ (Satirically.) _ By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail.	14152.853516762416

Say, thank you, mistress.	12151.143804029267
BLOOM: Thank you, mistress.	4311.683256410832
BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh ’ s the cook ’ s, a sandy one.	14643.553450380674
Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.	13968.196710025542
Drink me piping hot.	13956.939215319308
Hop! You will dance attendance or I ’ ll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush.	16767.63697411035
You ’ ll be taught the error of your ways.	8390.466632760905
At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips.	14051.44323593218
For such favours knights of old laid down their lives.	12241.625237628416
_ (He chuckles.) _ My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels.	12010.60791540707
First I ’ ll have a go at you myself.	13062.125045901083

CORNY KELLEHER: _ (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) _ Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet ’ s.	13961.891262973155
Like princes, faith.	10489.593069935356
One of them lost two quid on the race.	10052.584060503003
Drowning his grief.	16807.8688531982
And were on for a go with the jolly girls.	10709.3000522307
So I landed them up on Behan ’ s car and down to nighttown.	12697.952570560019
BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...	8638.784901556273
CORNY KELLEHER: _ (Laughs.) _ Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots.	10494.465610402509
No, by God, says I.	5591.404792225321
Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.	11146.963726562237
_ (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) _ Thanks be to God we have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me?	9651.261948392408
Hah, hah, hah! BLOOM: _ (Tries to laugh.) _ He, he, he! Yes.	14776.505399222078
Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don ’ t know him (poor fellow, he ’ s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...	16275.580173185366
_ (The horse neighs.) _ THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome! CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen ’ s and I told him to pull up and got off to see.	12852.504488597157
_ (He laughs.) _ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality.	3982.162948481596
Will I give him a lift home?	12017.10889181722
Where does he hang out?	9227.412318271834
Somewhere in Cabra, what?	13986.675545453661
BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.	9125.634129486012
_ (Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars.	6287.015119437839
Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls at the horse.	11349.531045004076
Bloom, in gloom, looms down.) _ CORNY KELLEHER: _ (Scratches his nape.) _ Sandycove! _ (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) _ Eh! _ (He calls again.) _ Eh! He ’ s covered with shavings anyhow.	13613.04799982106
Take care they didn ’ t lift anything off him.	14404.635535842786
BLOOM: No, no, no.	4918.607484598677
I have his money and his hat here and stick.	8432.92243250214
CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he ’ ll get over it.	12941.86595369037
No bones broken.	7503.861566893145
Well, I ’ ll shove along.	8105.730168847219
_ (He laughs.) _ I ’ ve a rendezvous in the morning.	4593.441759280801
Burying the dead.	16807.8688531982
Safe home! THE HORSE: _ (Neighs.) _ Hohohohohome.	15153.711276681504
BLOOM: Good night.	4168.411429165288
I ’ ll just wait and take him along in a few...	7264.645238029794
_ (Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it.	7584.219001286995
The horse harness jingles.) _ CORNY KELLEHER: _ (From the car, standing.) _ Night.	10604.186151107207
BLOOM: Night.	3164.613181888742
_ (The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly.	6564.561015518128
The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.	10450.038017232057
Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom ’ s plight.	13950.99073574301
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat.	10897.741156414968
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.	11946.947628871018
With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	14389.455304177885
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	12213.5427896808
The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.	10450.110969036885
Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.	10921.092029422121
Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.	11631.47397805001
The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay.	11413.09423104223
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen ’ s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute.	12956.736523646767
Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.) _ BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _ (There is no answer; he bends again.) _ Mr Dedalus! _ (There is no answer.) _ The name if you call.	12695.026837442032
Somnambulist.	19456.598729469286
_ (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) _ Stephen! _ (There is no answer.	9196.000496131273
He calls again.) _ Stephen! STEPHEN: _ (Groans.) _ Who?	10940.00091945349

Bloom, holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect.	10577.73846801762
A dog barks in the distance.	8433.94953544488
Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant.	12304.7220915156
He looks down on Stephen ’ s face and form.) _ BLOOM: _ (Communes with the night.) _ Face reminds me of his poor mother.	10728.491191811505

_ (Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master.	11037.083267729462
Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.	15785.46582061431
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.) _ BLOOM: _ (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) _ Rudy! RUDY: _ (Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom ’ s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.	12661.947354305114
He has a delicate mauve face.	5696.154900772268
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.	11335.754535133476
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.	12014.255661386733
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	14722.014122785264
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	15394.006631913848
But how to get there was the rub.	10084.705752987047
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	14462.322467679582
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	16307.217743874071
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	15596.756234945458
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	15139.374321923624
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	15806.843261064196
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	15402.976948230307
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	15244.089057945635
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	15508.284240036219
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	16399.785500904214
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	16571.435999646732
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	16392.957222465993
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	16352.441820505228
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	15089.52591608791
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	15630.806835340147
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	15853.805283483463
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	14884.540335355161
s.	5559.588761025092
d.	6486.056094892298
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	16616.170824956855
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	15468.173609031419
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	10547.125611085605
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	16712.928180062612
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	15371.635147611394
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	13924.644781600751
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	13444.754893731744
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	4381.886734673912
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	14277.384235336416
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	13364.623086085114
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	16300.38330860177
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	14069.305754019806
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	14964.8515936507
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	14319.553606191932
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	16547.856614717395
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	15220.942985454467
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	15870.296748191544
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	12957.104208309434
His friends had all deserted him.	10004.661937286033
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	16819.4380831523
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	12716.8362177251
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	14621.249510272539
Anyhow he was all in.	12734.21474022955
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	10546.102241757533
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	11450.730189759117
Try it.	8111.880526127519
You may mention my name.	8702.555279330452
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	10383.832992373764
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	10259.976124958173
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	10243.416830085233
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	6930.533359628325
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	16376.897839968236
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	14796.676677075486
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	9539.679634075006
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	15923.956897313217
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	15657.789539862619
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	13973.425264276322
Whereas.	15443.024084639697
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	14768.005353665332
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	10235.513513494543
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	14344.104511504298
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	10371.329742385788
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	13894.212333769912
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	13600.362830879421
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	16130.177634944872
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	8947.773864544113
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	10646.350153676069
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	11408.175043110501
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	8865.630982040177
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	4861.843044781867
Who ’ s that with you?	6821.870381398539
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	11523.967078346672
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	12025.646093632493
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	11218.008063778218
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	13826.7683504219
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	9124.524742789468
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	15407.437747815136
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	14294.743430059494
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	14566.558148712114
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	16748.078184702874
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	16254.448717220968
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	13456.14120909849
Pretty thick that was certainly.	16053.975985553223
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	13967.610340081439
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	16298.63255330844
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	12166.42126685863
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	15242.779418660306
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	13258.756054091938
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	13017.142719358455
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	7292.582614971008
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	9338.872700590311
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	13412.845140933849
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	15585.587885593786
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	12464.098572427161
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	14510.075569856113
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	12739.334595466897
Simply fag out there for nothing.	16702.366946211594
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	10575.94806656562
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	8833.633662434444
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	11487.066078545022
Where does he live at present?	9924.816234612641
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	10991.54258787022
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	7579.210510410088
Why?	1363.914055113649
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	11990.546076863719
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	10803.853923993442
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	15438.395437403815
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	15889.776616981751
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	12271.945368211263
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	11665.955796929538
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	11946.869198372126
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	13692.722101093581
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	15952.686882396447
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	12864.1636777694
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	15374.723118863925
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	16782.713263309317
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	16693.93263091658
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	10564.877370668433
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	17451.741159554967
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	15917.811080363654
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	14668.870053323524
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	13910.313810451546
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	16064.341258081688
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	14940.362993815395
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	14194.188327362235
I mean for singing purposes.	5757.155410784683
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	11051.793213347151
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	17279.93518182534
_Belladonna.	19456.598729469286
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	15621.536067439602
They were haggling over money.	7108.633073977755
— Is that so?	2744.613770264572
Mr Bloom asked.	1384.4535954744215
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	14404.824232443496
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	14170.769134886794
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	15071.766755701141
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	14911.404297676765
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	11885.31605802931
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	17356.98505688499
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	11551.71215048311
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	17570.648302713715
What ’ s in a name?	3211.705809541408
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	5697.471782486263
Of course.	5306.671430083656
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	14359.316185554402
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	14224.094149365303
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	15275.623211725995
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	13335.716718391475
— You know Simon Dedalus?	4098.818706011254
he asked at length.	7106.1922255914515
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	4218.971973179213
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	10587.391430709893
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	8978.216187514508
All Irish.	6523.269050754646
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	7168.764029875147
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	15061.796012690203
The lefthand dead shot.	6549.046155587141
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	15660.227300013328
— Bottles out there, say.	7552.619014829941
Fifty yards measured.	18227.54902377354
Eggs on the bottles.	17932.61452774436
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	15316.311760780649
Aims.	19456.598729469286
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	9156.824637749562
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	12568.916406514641
— Pom! he then shouted once.	7197.74215208178
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	12139.65151336103
— Pom! he shouted twice.	6487.36423537564
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	16678.47074066458
— Long ago?	4720.890658155755
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	6781.9292734217015
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	11488.399461690346
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	10803.879064787341
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	7513.812308227862
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	9164.875319747955
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	9479.812288846291
D.	2550.969629454126
B.	2096.6593473913545
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	15868.195079096857
Know where that is?	13498.003490640338
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	7552.619014829941
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	16727.4985151238
That ’ s where I hails from.	3624.9555865109937
I belongs there.	5722.479309358666
That ’ s where I hails from.	3624.9555865109937
My little woman ’ s down there.	11722.409288093078
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	6875.197815958795
_For England, home and beauty_.	17570.648302713715
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	10583.619266273923
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	13144.394394645637
Across the world for a wife.	11732.36824691523
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	16138.819140623677
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	14225.823552009391
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	13738.211138578283
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	13172.502141867815
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	12000.501005343343
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	16635.086093072554
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	12847.313618678629
No chair for father.	8559.348879233634
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	16983.53434559331
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	13340.141309454279
Grin and bear it.	17932.61452774436
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	10205.64061694838
B.	2096.6593473913545
Murphy.	11785.351918411056
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	13680.924659937547
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	13894.79192430551
— Thank you, the sailor said.	4939.697351381668
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	13074.856924507072
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	7789.317895245278
I shipped to get over.	7748.087875888077
Paid off this afternoon.	17932.61452774436
There ’ s my discharge.	4304.903082273703
See?	7170.617849299677
D.	2550.969629454126
B.	2096.6593473913545
Murphy.	11785.351918411056
A.	707.4051198927579
B.	2096.6593473913545
S.	2246.5143522196063
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	14038.247475802971
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	10222.038182478786
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	10159.014821320776
I was in the Red Sea.	5230.715902203781
I was in China and North America and South America.	7675.555398293946
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	11278.506208521194
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	7162.6727967212
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	11600.507773364701
I seen Russia.	4336.985769610065
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	18679.07077551165
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	4688.198053576939
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	9100.984633601545
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	7386.708355646157
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	8997.351969458445
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	11397.836980583403
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	12379.278031775653
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	11723.790284783914
Look here.	9574.187168464341
Here they are.	10171.51977187098
A friend of mine sent me.	8872.392851107246
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	13470.359245123313
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	10403.972071259352
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	16678.480084081308
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	9805.546867595524
Stomachs like breadgraters.	18227.54902377354
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	17076.309076796
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	14132.560571031974
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	13378.989088737637
— Know how to keep them off?	8239.274872544624
he inquired generally.	9781.482582933666
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	15771.791436114563
That boggles ’ em.	8359.805223348141
Glass.	14336.178182593083
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	10508.727475813
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	14431.71642523887
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	16393.34451338557
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	14257.374060181892
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	15064.09448255799
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	15517.089778161966
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	16178.974535081456
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	14720.221922408613
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	15141.84104658572
That was the rub.	4099.248312490207
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	16117.09715269879
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	15338.69662375866
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	16165.588982987338
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	14044.589650592065
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	16258.153922675601
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	10551.351557108295
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	12305.60944274744
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	13659.882201547784
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	17076.136894926323
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	16597.527267879526
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	8526.97872639584
Knife in his back.	15393.126810427384
Knife like that.	15175.67984183378
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	16899.809292592803
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	9777.560740422274
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	15710.001743080335
Like that.	4824.920605851159
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	13240.425283325796
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	17162.064257603583
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	13343.172039842902
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	7150.2960130421425
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	15156.168354692962
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	11329.48260534721
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	12202.046694472681
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	15298.794979636661
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	14870.489300512929
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	15509.522558030554
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	9783.576283077213
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	14844.58409947355
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	5953.3948552224665
Give us back them papers.	9712.246516183224
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	11115.20354139353
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	6890.008584490221
Mr Bloom inquired.	3325.5204136236644
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	12040.229991515072
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	13669.334017257026
— What year would that be about?	5597.4965049427965
Mr B interrogated.	7208.7708241715945
Can you recall the boats?	9808.36021179463
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	14676.366858940939
Salt junk all the time.	12950.29532371835
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	16727.42622563514
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	15643.29708125987
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	15659.430054997461
And it left him wondering why.	7754.270526845846
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	16395.74700232757
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	10688.96104879968
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	16411.29654698647
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	12687.212416325954
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	16597.527267879526
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	6319.510091530006
I hate roaming about.	5686.505441203406
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	12628.998714334615
— What age is he?	4108.122735159479
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	16464.67481266022
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	8637.64512421796
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	8257.752159178477
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	14480.592168083693
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	9382.780342165726
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	8055.605331586862
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	6042.5251324598585
I hate those buggers.	5686.505441203406
Suck your blood dry, they does.	17451.623842446083
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	16463.41151905231
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	7552.619014829941
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	11693.787288563692
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	15637.719585859737
There he is himself, a Greek.	7726.459901297577
one asked the sailor.	16760.897092969924
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	11988.854278566743
Someway in his.	18227.54902377354
Squeezing or.	18679.07077551165
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	8463.579443588993
There he is cursing the mate.	7025.877710997477
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	13091.601909293726
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	13514.441235414923
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	7324.7898331983515
He ’ s gone too.	2360.7905362066886
Ate by sharks after.	16760.897092969924
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	11554.819835789482
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	9351.00568971699
— And what ’ s the number for?	5714.6218866287845
loafer number two queried.	17932.61452774436
a third asked the sailor.	15150.556721689882
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	11362.603295782032
Ate.	16997.075953601572
A Greek he was.	7210.75792986819
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	13688.374474167338
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	14179.320481016306
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	15457.058111269724
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	14520.783095464798
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	15434.667473338232
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	15387.948670362643
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	16005.055275604793
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	5607.128740383547
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	13605.05536683624
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	16609.856668520133
Still no matter what the cause is from...	12591.627769339628
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	14891.481050462715
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	16609.827111563896
She is a bad merchant.	7328.025568904348
She buys dear and sells cheap.	9646.922470147376
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	15598.872588769591
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	15989.091173782548
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	10803.019647305215
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	14115.139225868113
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	11824.854502202463
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	15153.680722873694
Do you?	4068.3262710889317
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	16356.836420670572
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	14925.33993279827
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	13774.898518439697
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	10624.040115357067
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	13038.389826612081
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	15616.453353163239
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	11650.555500348079
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	15110.100977195665
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	15059.144811571781
I ’ m not so sure about that.	4032.2520615977937
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	11541.45389387888
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	15466.377110934183
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	9335.553479096305
Let me stir it.	7777.44334892897
And take a piece of that bun.	9694.057319299502
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	7282.5549376486515
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	12716.942999644893
Try a bit.	13211.596235347006
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	12586.841029090183
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	15258.340207630596
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	13192.950817373316
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	13554.043091718066
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	16367.859675997814
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	16103.776764705724
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	11273.864531906367
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	16343.399241378673
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	14433.782547687253
You ought to eat more solid food.	8603.245188636001
You would feel a different man.	7993.208475218169
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	6654.558580569133
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	11715.723050432365
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	7754.7695735033785
It reminds me of Roman history.	9771.709316273324
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	13716.652344864397
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	12160.969500641735
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	11913.634615208242
Look at him.	7236.649014185537
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	16043.122035780929
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	12175.242886083488
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	16080.080485740542
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	15245.110800741528
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	14072.061651472704
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	13570.433773416065
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	11763.868300573142
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	17162.064257603583
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	16588.529204954568
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	15492.654733841919
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	7284.966253207745
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	16425.59196679087
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	15647.65409115456
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	14379.849265136096
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	10869.595266701916
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	11708.56405894
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	16830.3113653921
She has the Spanish type.	7469.123892897871
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	14175.167266912102
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	10205.64061694838
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	7716.439671385444
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	9904.559080238983
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	17932.61452774436
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	6800.633070183498
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	13819.199884734408
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	6746.276244025907
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	7746.593543223876
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	16338.57233207161
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	8916.453222764361
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	12345.553221809063
An exception here and there.	10533.839831678682
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	16076.764652330885
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	15552.449673381769
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	15873.080491558125
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	16237.607534922
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	17279.93518182534
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	14240.537521370168
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	15424.282544358155
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	13981.67372092146
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	12169.538100189837
s.	5559.588761025092
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	16819.419911419274
No aid was given.	8559.348879233634
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	14131.674800111567
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	9543.13893903606
At this stage an incident happened.	10333.419667863229
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	12906.50488540418
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	11732.412864251319
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	13677.582862440764
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	16110.630927991795
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	15272.054202992897
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	16144.366441967264
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	11583.29174846246
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	16586.29794128738
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	11853.03125416223
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	13973.241023197266
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	14601.124444842972
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	12886.900869707863
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	14861.027645517965
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	14164.830181539211
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	16225.73124925247
— Am I right, skipper?	6824.613287354657
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	14205.802678247775
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	14481.127164286327
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	13663.09387841628
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	16231.280820596425
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	15997.341595341008
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	14356.7431879916
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	13641.126256260557
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	14454.52408028966
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	12657.662452752338
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	9484.074403340821
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	16673.07327087421
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	13981.321516505848
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	15124.433882314173
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	16654.630702959552
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	9975.267020722324
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	12201.743269844634
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	13643.357147897204
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	6698.831454257279
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	13096.9544675048
And the best jumpers and racers?	5892.773075861061
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	8310.361440766073
Tell me that.	9059.172587734009
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	9626.766010507312
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	4428.938698209204
The Irish catholic peasant.	6121.13133314049
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	4476.165895497929
You know Jem Mullins?	6049.797295386751
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	15924.423972896366
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	14749.44998077252
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	15741.812942788025
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	15237.678750494766
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	15478.700328460574
And now, why?	5631.639022729904
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	15635.731609305922
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	15503.149081983827
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	15160.237019285874
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	16090.38399623228
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	14257.355188382582
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	8875.42825647575
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	13779.56915612226
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	16819.4380831523
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	14025.534213862475
s.	5559.588761025092
d.	6486.056094892298
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	15242.597071565611
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	14623.17981604866
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	11203.409833720523
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	10472.110899071193
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	14370.31087833159
A soft answer turns away wrath.	8433.94953544488
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	11434.030211241532
Am I not right?	10354.130601157123
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	13728.702237813188
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	13746.477556444172
— Of course, Mr B.	5536.237354236232
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	16620.767957823315
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	14114.870727393225
But with a little goodwill all round.	9671.796938882095
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	8335.68455874225
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	10271.089772928199
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	9591.505198478379
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	10512.986157440577
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	11322.875614967388
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	12730.517610357287
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	8492.718399029318
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	6928.329743080199
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	12109.757880578702
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	15362.792609388294
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	6495.941634102412
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	13661.76975447399
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	16456.534090886395
Why?	1363.914055113649
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	12385.444577430444
They are practical and are proved to be so.	9526.891438041457
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	9405.779243329156
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	11921.04379721698
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	17076.136894926323
Turks.	19456.598729469286
It ’ s in the dogma.	3611.7476410445915
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	15103.034275156739
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	8680.272454802467
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	13510.073860882503
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	10071.078782389155
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	13311.374277812058
I call that patriotism.	6084.005853682513
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	16917.697281476372
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	12256.02355015248
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	15681.317506443454
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	14394.402314811181
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	12948.045439289714
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	10564.877370668433
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	11959.488305678415
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	16983.53434559331
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	9327.7760868466
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	13507.553676276188
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	16644.041190546446
That ’ s work too.	3465.8609307746915
Important work.	18679.07077551165
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	14738.450406673279
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	12609.320374436265
What?	694.4811020788688
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	12071.56708885913
Each is equally important.	15393.126810427384
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	12448.18213337461
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	7364.149026038885
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	10769.189886503034
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	9618.493761171452
Excuse me.	12340.567951090532
What was it you...?	5828.072046413506
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	13506.584026265196
Let us change the subject.	9088.115729573668
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	15080.739088658516
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	10450.038017232057
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	16072.306567177448
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	16150.173049754618
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	15498.952308912194
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	15419.203799957811
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	15121.63195699938
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	16497.51436392129
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	16481.306629420193

— There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	9382.780342165726

And so forth and so on.	6370.163073695612
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	14484.418501817761
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	15995.844591920359
Something evidently riled them in his death.	13304.886493112099
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	16543.425291105865
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	15259.792297528627
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	16637.682006576764
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	14019.017611239055
And the identical same with murderers.	6199.111992755014
You had to come back.	7882.178382055992

He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	14408.25807220849
Still as regards return.	10263.365675266863
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	12186.52665976682
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	12784.090012605571
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	15643.976520728891
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	14499.07848739387
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	9727.995446950861
She put the first nail in his coffin.	9243.584353215369
— Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi - disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	12512.407585668696
She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	10743.990129089732
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	8997.351969458445
The husband was a captain or an officer.	9484.074403340821
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	8366.264589868782
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	14341.699699464456
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	15667.417313572423
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	15895.004480808864
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	16420.92393686347
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	16484.341133899892
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	14920.404923976399
Poser.	19456.598729469286
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	15038.262162460876
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	16013.470784217645
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	15171.211799461975
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	13265.573010573338
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	14636.303434393127
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	16453.38164210948
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	12235.507522720316
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	10745.385356873887
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	12959.505636592618
— Was she?	3674.713374409653
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	13932.50059738403
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	17162.064257603583
So, Spain.	8166.976190181595
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	16558.887241763605
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	11656.86475743856
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	15664.06315221574
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	15439.895201645031
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	11163.639066636957
Taken a few years since.	15786.109314441857
In or about ninety six.	9442.982486109322
Very like her then.	12818.243863230015
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	16355.361264587433
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	15036.048908740479
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	13532.653132209658
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	14891.239719674824
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	16601.194688851698
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	12438.919656522981
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	15910.595327446574
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	15267.20508878101
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	7807.13098085137
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	15095.170828940834
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	12986.623284715673
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	16556.965533024595
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	14309.793954175879
Suppose she was gone when he?	11721.993074791146
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	15027.43585973356
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	14525.216264641449
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	15895.562578543555
And why not?	5833.351982221742
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	15537.308107384282
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	14912.595966298664
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	15811.490375742842
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	16046.789049323828
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	15593.510715648217
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	15837.458635346222
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	15825.940943589501
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	15905.661180993855
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	13464.121420613666
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	15687.747001673531
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	14555.943342832212
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	14752.199693215278
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	9012.623301232685
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	13508.244492584234
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	5432.602865328346
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	10884.826644159857
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	17279.93518182534
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	14811.07725476928
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	15372.82515547286
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	16083.225275742176
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	15764.02807661993
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	13140.309555332977
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	15697.27658424858
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	13651.063820139732
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	15700.263351202619
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	15990.891421742339
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	16021.812890721387
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	13688.432016569102
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	15814.833407905146
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	9484.074403340821
Your god was a jew.	10957.804539328288
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	14766.084635446361
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	12343.416278812028
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	12132.097985687598
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	7446.927937090408
Do you like cocoa?	6491.583058108217
Wait.	1374.254002664509
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	3833.0383142546275
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	13940.207101302069
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	9958.431559188977
An opening was all was wanted.	11723.321491437953
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	15171.979972799332
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	13967.59753592113
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	14113.904675036934
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	11262.172934721655
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	10970.10137561972
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	7475.015113212448
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	12918.403832617763
— Are you bad in the eyes?	5323.477953243621
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	13439.963644518888
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	13399.497724278355
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	17451.682501789175
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	13318.14422564319
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	16123.727684533402
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	16043.804214754025
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	6615.973226503897
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	16446.08948225064
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	13156.119792930285
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	11437.183579512397
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	13768.548010744787
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	13593.862077780615
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	15466.819281256005
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	12274.88914147691
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	11357.030084132413
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	10825.296781314697
Come.	2476.0160925037276
It ’ s not far.	3208.8616165875333
Lean on me.	15868.195079096857
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	15429.856912921534
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	10813.363620491364
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	15188.16286951117
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	16206.507720597097
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	15154.08693805431
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	15099.72884392445
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	16465.6309309754
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	14490.03159918744
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	15404.139450655848
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	13856.100736559953
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	14432.171910514166
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	15470.349816818634
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	15317.601013016585
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	16126.817186948641
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	14808.46794015152
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	13747.059734044899
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	14736.061428601952
Beware of the steamroller.	14233.412627925942
They thereupon stopped.	7257.990460918538
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	15772.16611381842
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	10492.183609767311
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	13654.382983576208
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	13551.830608919247
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	16076.67622742276
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	16782.713263309317
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	16199.402249193654
— What ’ s this I was saying?	3743.041625782148
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	13707.405996222478
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	14007.200465066353
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	14667.517896145406
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	16809.28592815453
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	15914.134081105854
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	15313.485572694599
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	13197.71000195344
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	15616.281397908995
A.	707.4051198927579
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	16185.911420133682
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	16104.435275053303
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	14745.76228374387
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	14887.127334690183
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	16191.37012406496
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	15379.894509055295
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	14889.675075270436
The horse was just then.	6770.365694865241
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	15473.39163678606
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	13992.572427858831
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	15910.625409673918
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	13149.643996654671
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	16670.561418906425
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	17932.61452774436
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	14822.500483996888
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	15925.86951967977
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	10937.387323645431
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	16292.822717529702
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	16760.771196397855
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	11645.507728300772
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	16079.051837086201
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	13951.679905861822
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	15160.237019285874
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	15475.26057588501
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	15758.785791053037
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	14861.027645517965
Were their views on some points divergent?	13951.656909662132
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	14819.124693919737
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	15783.421739102017
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	15107.49269642325
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	14291.327896804263
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	10825.337716218764
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	13786.503255285297
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	13662.84242548527
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	13520.752782482183
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	13627.572901123236
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	13795.07700500644
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	15116.513597623332
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	8057.110950988127
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	13659.97584851725
As in what ways?	10176.153002569752
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	15449.29507161867
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	14500.06529270354
Was it there?	8830.65556642998
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	11286.840000845894
Why was he doubly irritated?	8784.934240871971
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	13118.805102686945
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	12547.83658086127
To enter or not to enter.	10936.67922026404
To knock or not to knock.	10936.67922026404
Bloom ’ s decision?	6672.037756693076
A stratagem.	4762.787687825449
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	16622.357342847183
Did he fall?	7058.708772156359
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	16057.004326845681
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	9711.490824324925
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	10937.387323645431
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	16037.104687698773
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	9937.798298020645
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	14362.671793588917
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	8916.453222764361
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	11290.592161017274
Did Stephen obey his sign?	10690.034402560348
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	14447.058035884695
What did Bloom do?	4519.676753124374
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	15850.245878662165
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	11270.187348837722
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	16242.975853070811
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	12361.294916773038
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	16148.73074532875
What did Bloom see on the range?	7284.1003549194575
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	13018.945940591988
What did Bloom do at the range?	6963.245142483347
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	13764.771125369696
Yes.	992.2748593504894
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	16202.226884453554
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	15995.170382756407
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	13445.208619889203
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	16464.118014396077
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	15748.49365389303
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	15696.522627045026
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	11654.650113305015
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	15101.803717054212
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	15531.09314966528
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	10403.972071259352
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	10078.017511432021
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	16742.235951354596
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	14998.929612054784
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	17076.136894926323
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	12653.185050003225
The phenomenon of ebullition.	6549.046155587141
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	16643.957103069548
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	16541.7446105787
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	10937.387323645431
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	12333.234547642382
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	12518.194989976837
To shave himself.	8536.593002969352
What advantages attended shaving by night?	8905.612818416968
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	15818.97480445881
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	11286.611258195999
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	14103.265191658194
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	12443.6257095824
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	14164.891817900729
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	13445.190131984386
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	14885.45789716662
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	11865.05175087018
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	11654.650113305015
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	15512.579144537609
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	8905.612818416968
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	15857.271667314462
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	13782.91442979289
In Bernard Kiernan ’ s licensed premises <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street: in David Byrne ’ s licensed premises, <NUM> Duke street: in O ’ Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon ’ s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	14768.83633662778
W.	7783.110360723915
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	16609.856668520133
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	15032.128665740613
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	9368.575798655642
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	14721.93929302054
His mood?	6055.98139396054
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	11541.407769676878
What satisfied him?	6664.161869368329
To have sustained no positive loss.	10936.67922026404
Light to the gentiles.	13956.939215319308
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	10373.187192026417
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	14947.824248042461
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	11949.134755353967
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	16447.742482758502
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	13274.421629098702
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	14578.60041961225
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	15049.662334141798
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	13235.237533615118
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	13745.75397765357
Who drank more quickly?	9827.298447216312
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	15027.15447858643
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	9368.575798655642
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	16675.72271955882
Had he found their solution?	11326.448326956826
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	14777.401737372329
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	15081.173283242273
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you ’ ll find room.	14587.403529861127
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	12390.810821799085
Bloom.	1916.0088814178278
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	11848.974947362996
Name, age, race, creed.	16158.125825015217
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	11320.244785189629
Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob Bollopedoom Old Ollebo, M.	14303.83769774618

What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	11659.013375956854
G.	9227.897710055386
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	14444.775270584641

Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born <NUM>, acceded <NUM>) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist ’ s non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist ’ s revelations of white articles of non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody ’ s Book of Jokes_ (<NUM> pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	16114.99547891857
What relation existed between their ages?	9368.575798655642
<NUM> years before in <NUM> when Bloom was of Stephen ’ s present age Stephen was <NUM>.	14413.589326983098
<NUM> years after in <NUM> when Stephen would be of Bloom ’ s present age Bloom would be <NUM>.	14602.72388660163
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	14164.915623421397
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	10221.337663316315
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	13781.853788640019
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin ’ s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s father and Stephen ’ s granduncle, Stephen being then <NUM> years older.	13798.329700468637
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	14190.113974601247
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	15467.582814868363
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	14269.519568965889
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	15936.160554246224
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	13484.830033313301
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	15323.282794229535
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	13033.340625386913
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	15764.416252450474
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	11949.134755353967
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	15089.525915861548
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	14941.578571264423
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	15186.744914056811
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	13840.127997820904
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	16053.594653860462
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	12687.009800765643
Neither.	15443.024084639697
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen?	12431.515090553941
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	11637.67976824495
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?	10926.45163067175
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	14849.15392641829
Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	13770.364636695851
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?	14498.852148165295
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	12710.94462272871
A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O ’ Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	13168.984816461158
C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	8002.629964823923
Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C.	10933.884984929664
C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	8329.083921660082
Did they find their educational careers similar?	12319.609409218214
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame ’ s school and the high school.	16276.954743332462
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	16401.98525963856
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	11541.593563454213
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	14757.25450066364
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	9539.012551873897
The scientific.	4122.464502427211
The artistic.	4122.464502427211
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	13445.190131984386
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	16640.753080169856
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	14698.406510497656
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	10791.012602770306
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	14912.306291151934
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	9978.5550117665
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	10403.972071259352
James, the former by his <NUM> d bazaar at <NUM> George ’ s street, south, the latter at his <NUM> / <NUM> d shop and world ’ s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at <NUM> Henry street, admission <NUM> d, children <NUM> d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.	16364.444665723819

His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.	14634.149362858978

What?	694.4811020788688
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel.	11178.723179589057
Queen ’ s Ho...	15669.322221546165
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	8923.83789000815
The Queen ’ s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the <NUM> June <NUM>, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of <NUM> parts of aconite liniment to <NUM> of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at <URL> <URL>. on the morning of <NUM> June <NUM> at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, <NUM> Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at <URL> <URL>. on the afternoon of <NUM> June <NUM> a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, <NUM> Main street, Ennis.	15010.437065093978
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	11915.35064384723
Coincidence.	9031.408469903961
He preferred himself to see another ’ s face and listen to another ’ s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	13567.342390776379
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	13663.37859093633
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	16133.417185249049
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise <URL> <URL>., sunset <URL> <URL>. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	16367.769654329803
What to do with our wives.	9368.575798655642
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	9238.953858253673
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	16537.315569052233
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	13445.208619889203
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	14439.039673797015
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	13233.45902514872
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	12828.679159522322
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	12728.242712182224
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	15270.08875152301
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	16754.261275802186
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	13678.486970773196
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	11869.292484251426
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	11921.30532773619
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	12705.109670856546
Variously.	19456.598729469286
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other ’ s ignorant lapse.	15401.657029984293
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	10756.321553595013
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	14879.716011978348
What system had proved more effective?	9368.575798655642
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	17932.61452774436
Example?	19456.598729469286
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	13747.990321324462
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest ’ s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	16937.447176526683
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	15393.857601609403
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	14275.631923781051
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	12312.189087130342
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?	15253.157117416791
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	16579.473645281072
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?	14402.948244815405
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	14853.384300486256
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m ’ baad l ’ zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	14406.85770098913
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	13775.72499156068
By juxtaposition.	7739.307484912719
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, and <NUM>.	14972.884440727421
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	14326.17608433816
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	16983.53434559331
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	12653.140018471115
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar <NUM> years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	15839.16616389788
Mary ’ s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve ’ s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	16146.86664917817
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	17356.98505688499
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	11286.513756215361
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	9034.234237008823
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	11716.697325670295
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	10095.751026046188
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	14480.57130829783
Did the guest comply with his host ’ s request?	12284.129811374001
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	17162.064257603583
What was Stephen ’ s auditive sensation?	7977.357590342451
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	10360.629030471691
What was Bloom ’ s visual sensation?	7977.330776506259
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	10650.720033620286
What were Stephen ’ s and Bloom ’ s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	12147.670001987457
Visually, Stephen ’ s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	16791.027623218703
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	12653.140018471115

On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († <NUM>), exponent of Shakespeare.	13164.127655676768
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	13950.107501432074
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	16712.85923794833
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	16124.289314517251
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	15073.185262325984
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	11146.067096917044
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew ’ s windows all.	10258.83674490138
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	9991.08927375814
With unmixed feeling.	8720.090461897724
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	17010.718138155575
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	16091.095232717094
Then out there came the jew ’ s daughter And she all dressed in green.	12396.708884338865
“ Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again. ” I can ’ t come back and I won ’ t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	16564.807441349563
For if my master he did hear He ’ d make it a sorry ball. ” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	15394.483299128076
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	11494.309040009153
And now he ’ ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	11807.047770525134
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	9991.08927375814
With mixed feelings.	8720.090461897724
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew ’ s daughter, all dressed in green.	15938.233197032945
Condense Stephen ’ s commentary.	17724.87334026543
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	11792.365884403374
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	14440.151290319374
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	13744.762963457888
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	13969.501380925489
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	8967.044894206509
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	13249.71912232043
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	9435.833250048645
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	11923.607562517649
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	8967.044894206509
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	15118.382946364864
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	14287.915685886072
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	14679.315007800082
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	15378.260188804303
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	14734.847826600893
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	16555.270094359774
What other infantile memories had he of her?	9677.621006413794
<NUM> June <NUM>.	9824.298071210424
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	11270.831868365593
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	15292.843660124205
What endemic characteristics were present?	8638.7839666994
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	16760.727737707093
What memories had he of her adolescence?	9539.04461491944
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	11172.774148947972
On the duke ’ s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	13507.694498833724
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	13993.243651268478
On the vigil of the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).	13332.910329599003
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	13682.854605770754
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	17162.064257603583
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	11949.134755353967
A temporary departure of his cat.	8872.392851107246
Why similarly, why differently?	10277.587600275956
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	17041.351916654137
In other respects were their differences similar?	10693.844815858989
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	10299.49822718882
As?	3947.017453609157
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	16899.786054421136
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	16690.61790245826
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	16225.746123454244
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	13978.947891343587
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	13875.729974983096
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	16115.017929493282
In what manners did she reciprocate?	8391.855645597432
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	13636.31737239492
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	14505.539167604027
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	14840.686841631914
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	13170.48028178753
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	15277.816481408292
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	12653.140018471115
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	11073.209434466782
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	11996.729652497575
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	14900.841306920014
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	13166.070654906873
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	13756.75286103699
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, <NUM> October <NUM>.	12973.486959338557
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?	11320.244785189629
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), <NUM> June <NUM>, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	14071.041202150274
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	10957.500483654949
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	17162.064257603583
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	11320.244785189629
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ <NUM> <NUM>), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	14102.59878300253
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	13678.486970773196
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	11677.32597598344
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	11426.509829491111
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, <NUM> Lower Abbey street (W.	14495.177299143725
and E.	11288.406558228855
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	15287.329285571617
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	11949.134755353967
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	15265.448414794755
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	14721.96712785108
and T.	8328.576267391503
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	15995.875801952967
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	11469.534979567283
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	8341.9955732057
Never.	5667.633815772718
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	12215.744960576623
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	15077.560680588433
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	11129.074309908361
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	16131.967067197358
Why did he desist from speculation?	7390.73151727713
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	14336.034176567764
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	11288.448422727277
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	12814.798842177039
Not verbally.	7341.9588068610365
Substantially.	19456.598729469286
What comforted his misapprehension?	7753.384680337188
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	13938.44314223108
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	13416.811251555664
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	16868.487024965427
What did each do at the door of egress?	9004.094996347989
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	10026.506959264807
Stephen put the hat on his head.	10097.41026346073
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	12518.222039354452
For a cat.	7591.371521003243
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	14754.051218382743
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	9975.267020722324
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	12636.374093993534
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	16315.006392062603
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	13020.771772555354
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	16189.873019968252
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	10137.018107522907
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	14792.472684975772
Of a different order of difficulty.	11451.77479589584
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	16580.267348045356
And the problem of possible redemption?	6199.111992755014
The minor was proved by the major.	8916.453222764361
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	14639.298212876729
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	15627.185508538369
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	15661.33113223254
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	12798.557629952278
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	12936.17569430671
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	15495.88965032692
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	13398.646661653742
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	16742.262607464203
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	13212.492911933949
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	14779.515353035677
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	12210.366936679191
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	16186.393033301472
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	12842.42090323089
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	14057.002971324975
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	13648.173404756337
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	14543.885318892813
Both then were silent?	13127.503305506403
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	16605.27055147329
Were they indefinitely inactive?	12818.243863230015
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	15775.871487591456
Similarly?	19456.598729469286
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	15589.360502264786
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	12842.334571037933
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	14122.19726764209
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	15788.288985214398
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	10495.011547250431
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	14108.143850806367
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	10385.533199284042
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	15738.425304276963
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	11745.24052061214
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	16563.61854971343
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	13199.697979776194
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	13235.269563269014
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	11654.650113305015
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	9541.488997587892
Turma circumdet.	12452.996386040257
Iubilantium te virginum.	9653.994498991498
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	11995.947317777174
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	14786.301627992061
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	12659.193569818657
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	13637.631781034297
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	13348.80329122177
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	13637.631781034297
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	13414.36661576039
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	12552.872442103673
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	15406.387122510174
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	16748.064491463207
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	10937.387323645431
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	12686.788932497191
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	12994.995458787516
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	16131.299886140789
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	7082.073948416487
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	16021.318321490779
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	13968.235142322852
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	14615.802054658461
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	8638.7839666994
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	14519.518856087861
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	16627.414130203724
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	15367.056321647027
Describe them.	16878.573427268955
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	15424.487546794426
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	14176.915060661213
What significances attached to these two chairs?	9978.5550117665
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	16959.24882930963
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	10160.160826275023
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies ’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	15216.417017980308

Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications _ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_, close.	16767.622055241918
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	11554.642987215793
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	15969.460096360055
His next proceeding?	7402.72619810262
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	16107.136389760426
What followed this operation?	6773.273691952053
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	12840.218585308325
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?	12210.366936679191
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?	11949.134755353967
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	12431.77730424151
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	15965.425072707278
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	11654.650113305015
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	11413.140265830152
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	10277.632016048128
Brothers and sisters had he none.	16112.477388603033
Yet that man ’ s father was his grandfather ’ s son.	13491.275021365085
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	10277.632016048128
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	13124.181080249919
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.	13359.06039208783
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	11654.67723391943
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.	13554.02844792014

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?	12443.6257095824
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.	14890.254182330907

Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?	12104.529904762507
Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.	16274.392927630159
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?	8923.83789000815

What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?	8923.83789000815

How was the irritation allayed?	9569.798301374827
He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table.	12931.505681294277
He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences.	15253.064124437575

He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin.	13468.486421560265
He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (<NUM> shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (<NUM> October <NUM>) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.	14678.873028613665

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.	16536.433232542735
Why with satisfaction?	8498.837790383894
Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis ’ s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.	15222.919451097352

How?	2870.066306384097
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	15963.493882478795
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	9471.541354278144
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	15972.021417755032
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	9961.657706981989
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	15766.142882422024
What preceding series?	6664.161869368329
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	16392.31420137558
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	14712.799306689345
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	16799.833052722297
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	13591.308050706424
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	15083.691657712707
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	11184.6773686283
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	16682.90235283324
Envy?	16997.075953601572
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	15585.661110186787
Jealousy?	19456.598729469286
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	14687.036197347174
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	15365.389413465864
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	13622.938618256461
Abnegation?	19456.598729469286
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	15800.092858580476
Equanimity?	19456.598729469286
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	15309.530828740331
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	14215.809052396084
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	16096.502028675955
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	15354.036436884526
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	11487.956889918205
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	12527.420419772228
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	15423.249248740567
What retribution, if any?	8638.7839666994
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	17115.978107251347
Duel by combat, no.	17724.87334026543
Divorce, not now.	17932.61452774436
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	16917.697281476372
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	16883.448887228955
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	17570.648302713715
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	15549.964168688657
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	14135.277952202288
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	15836.874402354786
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	12350.147236057977
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	16614.3327346176
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	6282.761978857577
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	14500.86063822577
Then?	4857.75342159322
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	13906.237872979667
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	6282.761978857577
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	13040.515652795793
What followed this silent action?	7693.865305788538
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.	17115.978107251347
With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?	11554.642987215793
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown.	15623.641290905742
Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn ’ s (Murphy ’ s) Hotel, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.	14770.687000223803
Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?	11469.534979567283
Absolutely.	16997.075953601572
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?	14895.285637455685

By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated <NUM> calendar month after the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth (<NUM> September <NUM>), viz.	13551.11218268295
<NUM> October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born <NUM> June <NUM>, having been anticipatorily consummated on the <NUM> September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place <NUM> weeks previous, viz.	15500.664010843231
<NUM> November <NUM>, to the birth on <NUM> December <NUM> of second (and only male) issue, deceased <NUM> January <NUM>, aged <NUM> days, there remained a period of <NUM> years, <NUM> months and <NUM> days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.	15088.948680478907
By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, <NUM> September <NUM>, there remained a period of <NUM> months and <NUM> day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	15439.849694370918
How?	2870.066306384097
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.	15348.766122066014
What moved visibly above the listener ’ s and the narrator ’ s invisible thoughts?	12653.185050003225

south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the

those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after

coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from

hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that

know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me

know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I
