3676.0289709748845
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	1310.350573113192
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	1686.4092768066437
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	5502.964010995228
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	1408.9713144495686
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	1878.3401498677615
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	724.8849569506925
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	1065.302074404145
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	1883.8253440011317
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	562.5124736706374
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	703.282595043976
Slow music, please.	4378.170953166441
Shut your eyes, gents.	2286.5783101417765
One moment.	3733.8357319168895
Silence, all.	1593.3016845421112
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	1402.2305818665936
Chrysostomos.	15787.963800563719
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	5006.24799914342
That will do nicely.	2463.4632511815807
Switch off the current, will you?	244.84645551223883
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	1285.6411008848443
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	1772.326349842391
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	2605.833491148463
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	622.9100753074704
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	811.453615399042
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	707.4757712991781
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	1211.450940414901
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	1887.581711084384
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	590.3146938971289
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	2980.779940966454
We must go to Athens.	3376.355396194113
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	751.8877891958371
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	449.6564642653073
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	2179.9578344305182
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	658.3941169492168
— Yes, my love?	203.9444133075237
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	1230.6562404347171
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	307.7093204693172
he said frankly.	1435.399032021917
A ponderous Saxon.	6237.634035433895
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	838.8102432643572
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	2429.713729551663
Because he comes from Oxford.	2189.9867852190587
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	777.5325382906635
He can ’ t make you out.	710.4805911916177
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	542.6659331956135
He shaved warily over his chin.	3865.6575117979096
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	796.9409988126193
Where is his guncase?	705.4697946545485
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	953.920734883889
Were you in a funk?	478.47912343194395
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	367.3152656030105
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	914.5235438923125
I ’ m not a hero, however.	645.9175796311175
If he stays on here I am off.	1161.792809392462
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	2036.2798480546378
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	1668.900510033074
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	3306.5256142096955
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	928.8578318155387
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	1267.5317950622687
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	3907.091856615717
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	1002.6389403106082
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	398.1119437033511
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	1963.1656741410156
— God! he said quietly.	823.2888535835034
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	725.8203370212973
The snotgreen sea.	5278.611340742602
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	47343.31264069686
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	628.1208609207235
You must read them in the original.	1003.2420789936293
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	2776.3069592590095
Come and look.	1428.5227025537304
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	730.724269920095
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	1190.4026977914027
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	1650.6557479169535
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	895.9193346104289
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	888.4045343979365
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	623.3523722798685
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	1671.0898664680708
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	702.3297014774945
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	1229.1049221448175
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	757.9104976134213
And you refused.	3087.5396269129205
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	2573.9985681073563
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	4506.391833830796
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	1095.4992403687017
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	1064.5349601574358
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	1756.2842859846307
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	856.3097523899525
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	967.7214001043486
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	1678.4825809492102
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	1851.913018548504
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	4019.958179868293
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	3600.058965755607
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	389.0054223102698
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	1193.1612225478927
How are the secondhand breeks?	376.7668494313913
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	1360.0245769256683
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	4729.793782874055
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	719.4587660516573
Secondleg they should be.	4310.823705629988
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	1067.2084490775596
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	1496.7461368472973
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	1220.2057002745853
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	1576.9943310276217
— Thanks, Stephen said.	719.6907457640762
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	956.4777307523011
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	604.1918904840603
Etiquette is etiquette.	12094.343247060106
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	1255.697745530744
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	1195.1716338295334
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	655.3125183564084
p.	5493.011093616205
i.	5827.72223398114
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	2085.981610546112
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	742.5676827430539
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	1418.0670252738116
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	7189.040169079692
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	788.0690862266819
Hair on end.	4085.0650552340408
As he and others see me.	946.8990290054878
Who chose this face for me?	232.70917152291207
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	1273.6946400791094
It asks me too.	677.6133972617043
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	741.0953685010143
It does her all right.	1287.0520776094247
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	5287.72540371396
Lead him not into temptation.	5908.800816859757
And her name is Ursula.	2135.330879220808
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	793.7921295131002
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	429.93884695726956
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	980.7324278300774
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	1928.1368311129872
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	732.226742595417
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	292.85442941684
he said kindly.	1464.0184571948982
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	1199.422503183117
Parried again.	10931.060665911922
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	883.5125454720115
The cold steel pen.	3848.6685577955473
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	1012.9483525925893
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	727.3624594264128
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	2902.8920974785206
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	722.7117199481806
Hellenise it.	6298.85791733158
Cranly ’ s arm.	1474.171512446952
His arm.	3268.4912671819616
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	1064.5478560691708
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	545.761662698898
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	485.19408478930507
What have you up your nose against me?	443.2810167994057
Is it Haines?	367.0022617471708
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	1900.2668801563477
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	4216.490338016685
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	2136.2156987549047
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	1201.9085466507308
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	1694.0227754003097
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	1023.3840987418662
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	2534.405366248787
To ourselves...	27297.719779627125
new paganism...	53382.96106953292
omphalos.	21558.06072352106
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	792.6191992777252
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	1018.5091629432827
— Then what is it?	215.4131332563692
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	5091.51331778484
Cough it up.	3048.9051193097453
I ’ m quite frank with you.	1294.0858323079754
What have you against me now?	339.4757389458722
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	977.9206449519588
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	3466.0524724057736
— Do you wish me to tell you?	354.68935518228415
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
— Yes, what is it?	156.438776398095
I don ’ t remember anything.	1151.6355208346076
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	607.1510948934815
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	2299.346810339517
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	461.5663965754326
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	471.8572286887113
Where?	188.90416504930744
I can ’ t remember anything.	1088.8703158997107
I remember only ideas and sensations.	792.624814950504
Why?	190.44911106412906
What happened in the name of God?	248.5046868900428
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	732.0415615377113
She asked you who was in your room.	872.0909925541546
— Yes?	157.4419951414339
Buck Mulligan said.	1952.9620742256293
What did I say?	259.00751459418444
I forget.	1880.8216698972428
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	934.7427857006908
— Did I say that?	232.1019374244688
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
Well?	200.2722160773838
What harm is that?	298.73578663218353
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	1169.9753002461212
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	342.77587132750307
You saw only your mother die.	2295.7795847847906
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	831.7376255499383
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	893.1498091244429
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	1938.8718641732971
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	1066.5441241808296
Why?	190.44911106412906
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	613.4802330948718
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	11078.144905545068
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	2409.0967880974135
Humour her till it ’ s over.	1112.2091317015688
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	1759.6248206407179
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	1169.338597445364
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	1009.4411837649508
He had spoken himself into boldness.	3102.631273147087
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	626.4134789863149
— Of what then?	317.7637386251404
Buck Mulligan asked.	2807.157829793692
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	351.43584006987476
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	1946.6223361581376
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	908.1274924185544
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	1530.854629195483
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	1214.8524151097793
Sea and headland now grew dim.	4363.499269941794
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	919.9325198309057
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	541.3857499690032
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	789.5692147762287
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	612.7718454662379
What does it care about offences?	1115.5224393711105
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	5270.5741035814135
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	610.369339634267
I ’ m inconsequent.	2057.110193449203
Give up the moody brooding.	5121.168613052449
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	1921.2176457236048
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	3118.0749129704595
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	2120.1257661193267
White breast of the dim sea.	1707.8438311764148
The twining stresses, two by two.	2327.4031629558385
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	5067.650663453217
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	7211.2573167745
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	1110.4936281063995
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	1235.87141699851
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	867.2267965624302
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	1160.775761919729
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	1035.0886229923667
She was crying in her wretched bed.	664.1334565334022
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	1008.4341232643948
Where now?	279.07141430545687
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	3697.1447308823763
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	1517.5217291391382
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	5454.293826213312
And no more turn aside and brood.	1820.5172414592591
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	1453.2466469849055
Memories beset his brooding brain.	19913.679760407947
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	1387.0253130888657
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	1257.1992293441301
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	1990.8440586054924
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	970.7914135873641
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	1150.3314520751735
On me alone.	2637.7846577483606
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	2519.4555799331374
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	3844.475242971386
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	1977.3614557709286
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	989.536478655888
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	5736.341793785952
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	1574.0497763259111
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	1274.2881121694663
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	831.7317643386015
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	746.4432666747045
Breakfast is ready.	7646.212981201894
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	1659.936572481047
It ’ s all right.	707.1123931211656
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	456.10380842970983
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	681.9404682958518
For my sake and for all our sakes.	1888.8267416311246
His head disappeared and reappeared.	3111.2300041731833
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	997.936429088666
He says it ’ s very clever.	772.3066472824362
Touch him for a quid, will you?	286.49302619775614
A guinea, I mean.	1011.3014343502917
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	734.5282897855517
— The school kip?	156.60774331012354
Buck Mulligan said.	1952.9620742256293
How much?	325.6049331867238
Four quid?	730.4144332723658
Lend us one.	4382.763786528912
— If you want it, Stephen said.	550.2415949026495
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	2337.753484569314
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	2880.1556820283404
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	26136.501618716626
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	1106.8470845847853
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	1679.0067294129915
Why should I bring it down?	470.34615780409183
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	349.26138782629334
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	867.4201588679941
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	1309.2282222240142
I am another now and yet the same.	817.1662503045742
A server of a servant.	462.6953978544411
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	1085.861178556666
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	1403.034528246327
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	478.0436741546406
Haines, open that door, will you?	257.0405137393952
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	676.3264006788814
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	1128.787939356641
— Have you the key?	279.73197575194325
a voice asked.	1283.9608365535564
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	711.4309792165899
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	1674.7844711977154
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	916.4798700643084
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	1763.7172620247716
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	1288.609759169185
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	828.4832458592423
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	767.4239172672134
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	663.9614130292678
Haines, come in.	771.967324916984
The grub is ready.	3811.903476574328
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	1725.8296634773217
Where ’ s the sugar?	215.04437309494838
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	724.2028223026492
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	556.8625140527388
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	918.5901956569645
— What sort of a kip is this?	168.7012354462952
I told her to come after eight.	1025.179368057646
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	1253.160795543603
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	307.69371658704983
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	1100.4237748802736
I want Sandycove milk.	2605.2275351838857
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	599.2447393829389
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	871.0867164410738
Sit down.	3535.81300243751
Pour out the tea there.	2218.9091893001214
The sugar is in the bag.	849.2010510644451
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	1177.1470249069412
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	2301.917618591079
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	410.31390159804255
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	292.5686074554487
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	887.5133577079332
And when I makes water I makes water.	1415.185433420638
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	399.7783975837947
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	1334.5915689186636
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	1238.3338995494685
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	507.9170060138553
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	1452.9175686671185
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	1282.0727874098397
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	505.8362023975113
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	682.482052748813
— Do you now?	249.56314522366978
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	1012.2703862615577
Your reasons, pray?	578.7162375673682
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	549.151154864282
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	1098.9965622685527
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	1324.9826234282511
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	1314.1324234371207
Do you think she was?	313.0258808560686
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	1633.651009091833
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	4474.22077368331
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	1933.1403361583868
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	450.1861795279412
Kinch, get the jug.	1029.2419139113044
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	1099.0987990127453
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	387.8617553572863
Glory be to God.	2015.6290823118516
— To whom?	344.9898329773359
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	786.0775093510445
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	589.4393371927148
— How much, sir?	247.51642223091
asked the old woman.	994.1171826759626
— A quart, Stephen said.	708.6746158453997
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	885.6936131999281
Old shrunken paps.	22391.549207358352
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	2657.3306710631673
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	803.5974787800172
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	852.3329904100768
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	1385.897590329102
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	3389.5305010066368
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	1032.9622811581162
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	2485.0726728556265
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	1642.7213098802774
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	888.2797804665458
— Taste it, sir, she said.	616.9422208713753
He drank at her bidding.	1584.4481397635182
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	795.361441160454
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	2904.5334073129798
— Are you a medical student, sir?	391.8305659314355
the old woman asked.	994.1171826759626
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	722.5544377534173
— Look at that now, she said.	519.6322226550343
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	4087.391712758406
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	1090.6581802785058
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	1653.1839381153409
— Do you understand what he says?	364.7318090005411
Stephen asked her.	1326.6400503582545
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	398.879426279459
the old woman said to Haines.	691.2793089329542
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	1560.672497776518
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	846.4094704284313
Is there Gaelic on you?	416.4609340405266
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	302.99122643143346
Are you from the west, sir?	272.63313138360024
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	1054.5405534167185
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	576.6035957049911
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	609.4479851365232
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	701.243153325953
Wonderful entirely.	1345.2833200383911
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	2062.7990362545384
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	397.80791299732414
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	453.94796129576827
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	385.1942921290726
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	418.03195283798635
Stephen filled again the three cups.	1871.2524639108326
— Bill, sir?	348.4702843827906
she said, halting.	1716.3355770415203
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	1473.641250902177
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	386.3293303480788
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	1225.7417345846372
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	409.17680604856577
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	1484.2585503263247
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	664.0655976586378
All I can give you I give.	982.4865538195504
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	1691.192166979894
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	766.4325879977362
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	558.8684055256205
Time enough.	5084.01489538101
Good morning, sir.	1342.6340979602383
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	677.6925387330505
I ’ m stony.	1770.5404119051123
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	987.4828000707971
Today the bards must drink and junket.	1852.8547414392372
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	1971.2011825836485
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	765.2292754226983
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	1226.1170883170605
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	663.7942583189947
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	1120.9354639306334
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	990.7294519293065
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	955.0354507498772
Speaking to me.	2282.0538031292826
They wash and tub and scrub.	3499.988264361034
Agenbite of inwit.	3791.0754645476386
Conscience.	15787.963800563719
Yet here ’ s a spot.	1060.0815658186839
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	1187.7746860862107
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	758.2314901363767
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	485.8706487944514
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	707.8726410973611
— Would I make any money by it?	432.36579122202755
Stephen asked.	2112.661370998925
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	531.4659248073577
He strolled out to the doorway.	870.9974945446214
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	1136.9802593143186
— Well?	185.1363622042088
Stephen said.	1342.343346619359
The problem is to get money.	1218.6893501176462
From whom?	509.6544479199824
From the milkwoman or from him.	1543.6372382658826
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	585.9304707375978
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	895.2948491442617
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	394.51481533000276
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	1417.4200350880444
— From me, Kinch, he said.	465.82473599518426
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	758.3450087731859
Damn all else they are good for.	1462.175180658117
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	398.0634718238256
To hell with them all.	1238.3557122736202
Let us get out of the kip.	464.7734193819321
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	1343.320461487436
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	1138.4233352046883
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	685.1351208301388
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	1204.1429091544412
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	739.3508013423681
I want puce gloves and green boots.	2694.0592289058736
Contradiction.	21558.06072352106
Do I contradict myself?	1013.595981098605
Very well then, I contradict myself.	2013.8728241310632
Mercurial Malachi.	11923.875116877909
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	2240.3535896889653
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	617.3722704512493
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	677.4678285226124
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	407.2481632486185
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	670.5128874889507
Come out, Kinch.	1248.6254936576552
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	950.6980591480861
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	1233.9747340430304
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	681.9706355163829
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	1216.121423990255
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	512.0515050859315
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	392.07892048578236
He walked on.	1244.4461477720354
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	2844.739510466703
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	639.3012022171305
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	1283.1214443153476
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	1000.680402243037
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	1582.109201809742
Martello you call it?	627.607306227229
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	960.1576387968704
But ours is the _omphalos_.	2346.7142931885173
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	358.2550115603325
Haines asked Stephen.	2465.108137967751
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	804.1745277677845
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	1322.045703767612
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	1031.9833951074572
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	492.45120305829636
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	1095.2586770859755
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	2704.4837224201133
Is it some paradox?	787.8399678765112
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	1967.1901625240682
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	976.2249280836211
It ’ s quite simple.	1323.7606046974943
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	864.2094818712402
— What?	128.22159737738772
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	886.7749334262746
He himself?	181.5697936337854
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	709.737880294703
And it is rather long to tell.	938.7305138375893
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	1095.8201438178978
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	1098.6851098329423
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	1099.414207028294
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	798.4630900281544
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	1770.9519803746643
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	2692.5852030096976
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	474.6982858015845
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	1222.9186185000187
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	1555.3517061062678
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	1249.8797174506142
The Father and the Son idea.	989.6528257827589
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	2196.719949757441
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	2744.098975598557
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	1098.4818110752524
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	818.3052139780756
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	532.9859211182173
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	4233.23064076778
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	650.3258384860841
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	685.7658508401298
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	2312.3391682111537
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	1554.8355650794847
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	858.4661811515776
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	2065.4839629934872
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	298.7401626915876
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	543.9133808768488
What did he call it?	270.68207214311934
Joseph the Joiner?	827.0715307318219
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	1410.055216582441
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	242.07068886530723
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	1005.5008246708372
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	148.40528062540204
Haines asked.	3369.7386519748475
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	379.63777815855514
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	2078.1893182574418
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	379.6172950116947
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	1785.427039300108
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	583.3405548172935
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	1195.1345272175024
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	694.2630045266175
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	309.9485599572758
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	451.7629530047676
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	1308.334646118875
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	302.05512003423905
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	762.2710929805719
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	623.9716833694216
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	3056.7612147842133
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	1581.082697541224
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	740.1181073626143
He wants that key.	1908.3311013901223
It is mine.	1970.3946260383354
I paid the rent.	1297.2923506608372
Now I eat his salt bread.	2157.235858345351
Give him the key too.	1273.9871709448835
All.	3094.113988145981
He will ask for it.	993.2388591855484
That was in his eyes.	592.056813043817
— After all, Haines began...	4274.78639327527
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	1086.606945233495
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	942.2144980839182
You are your own master, it seems to me.	839.3667517051273
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	584.3925348412342
— Italian?	247.95625795342332
Haines said.	2141.0654454224077
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	611.0432396158938
Kneel down before me.	4109.136227353091
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	754.0967297134702
— Italian?	247.95625795342332
Haines said again.	1973.6402028790087
What do you mean?	339.44877979421244
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	836.7386828700638
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	3523.250514423201
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	711.1932126988505
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	1499.186995095254
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	2307.6017490709587
It seems history is to blame.	2126.120133794473
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	2314.3777530216475
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	2236.6478008585977
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	1549.002800535999
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	1536.4882941318176
Idle mockery.	18812.731941147817
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	1281.6377769421392
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	3007.136293067731
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	961.5514250429821
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	1132.3645218202078
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	710.5127497166989
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	574.7783893714458
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	1561.0474911670835
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	889.7832760136987
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	636.5546323765058
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	538.6283013869931
It ’ s nine days today.	1477.1933376816335
The man that was drowned.	1015.8507808104097
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	1524.4171661696178
Here I am.	1782.8525804648345
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	1577.67660674615
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	1542.476519279265
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	1220.16506082322
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	250.87669547232272
— Down in Westmeath.	2781.505554555121
With the Bannons.	3566.9403784077363
— Still there?	246.50801446696317
I got a card from Bannon.	1273.9501052324144
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	1763.1581593372691
Photo girl he calls her.	2797.5635025457755
— Snapshot, eh?	499.8349880779236
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	2607.0835188533597
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	1892.1562627590235
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	865.9780176502106
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	1470.6285437455379
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	702.565745946716
— Going over next week to stew.	1015.0612385709936
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	176.61008349095007
— Yes.	1408.8980448614918
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	1211.7593000677527
The father is rotto with money.	1891.300758396275
— Is she up the pole?	397.1306566084983
— Better ask Seymour that.	2094.537258083267
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	1521.114546194535
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	1656.7613688811164
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	819.9672841630048
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	1910.227999619303
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	798.7747782288969
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	945.1377074326496
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	327.538051651561
— Yes.	1408.8980448614918
Make room in the bed.	1297.8625715344506
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	996.5461104894333
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	1211.1739909476235
— Are you not coming in?	277.3876729891465
Buck Mulligan asked.	2807.157829793692
— Later on, Haines said.	1136.7442472239695
Not on my breakfast.	1836.1392398213288
Stephen turned away.	2190.8530701822574
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	340.52961724710843
Stephen handed him the key.	1322.1074112495976
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	2970.527363097697
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	425.50718293213816
Throw it there.	2682.8838662446997
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	947.1537588041416
Dressing, undressing.	7298.041443842746
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	1001.1774713481299
Thus spake Zarathustra.	31718.43281108029
His plump body plunged.	6668.970887651922
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	706.5135904522601
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	552.9476111895991
Half twelve.	6642.328927408863
— Good, Stephen said.	627.1806666621211
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	3095.358102603078
Liliata rutilantium.	21818.673176800712
Turma circumdet.	27324.731655759035
Iubilantium te virginum.	19519.03527693144
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	2425.446148189545
I will not sleep here tonight.	1742.3797741454398
Home also I cannot go.	4209.482294969188
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	619.8286178654422
It called again.	2472.533071573196
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	559.3718369386378
Usurper.	21558.06072352106
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	343.05269760744665
— Tarentum, sir.	1924.046438669463
— Very good.	1950.024372038699
Well?	200.2722160773838
— There was a battle, sir.	643.5814048177901
— Very good.	1950.024372038699
Where?	188.90416504930744
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	1183.8252131403938
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	1810.6199538044702
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	1087.9950282557218
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	702.9228264741596
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	1091.9365617079786
What ’ s left us then?	282.3255276010743
— I forget the place, sir.	541.4247605165679
<NUM> B.	2632.1286671831967
C.	3903.316026160732
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	855.768565610601
— Yes, sir.	717.4852047500266
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	1476.217442177714
A dull ease of the mind.	1622.6065477819268
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	1886.19355484552
Any general to any officers.	3012.1316015382768
They lend ear.	4167.758168935606
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	250.17085438999956
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	254.05286269337614
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	401.5032625518913
— I know, sir.	518.9972689316721
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	1095.382953448537
— Wait.	1846.9960530187354
You, Armstrong.	359.99730697253716
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	697.2981441735773
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	1024.8224263560767
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	1009.3704422992454
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	891.1054003210437
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	2102.6363819537446
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	871.5226246167434
Vico Road, Dalkey.	8370.726932871972
— Pyrrhus, sir?	232.1070780318536
Pyrrhus, a pier.	1211.9236999070501
All laughed.	3738.9127906075896
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	23026.501893880293
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	1828.1136494970415
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	1007.5526179969037
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	473.0331392909688
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	375.2024834466832
A thing out in the water.	638.3139803942938
A kind of a bridge.	871.9030903722057
Kingstown pier, sir.	2069.1625485232425
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	3294.217322878443
Two in the back bench whispered.	1441.952542138108
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	2251.980252821335
All.	3094.113988145981
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	1304.1883664666384
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	2009.4000107724075
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	1046.5387076107763
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	1527.371973497983
The words troubled their gaze.	2510.2284204167977
— How, sir?	174.2968892605339
Comyn asked.	7951.3790255338145
A bridge is across a river.	1596.5121561653345
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	2441.6408937321858
No - one here to hear.	1214.6786385671066
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	2121.1094504551747
What then?	195.78097683111872
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	1541.8412092676842
Why had they chosen all that part?	670.1684250404147
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	1364.178530553072
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	1349.887646481593
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	1820.6551556195727
They are not to be thought away.	1000.0959675264993
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	1094.1832782914707
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	734.5634910117568
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	543.6732677585443
Weave, weaver of the wind.	2277.1017471203068
— Tell us a story, sir.	902.9052874046472
— O, do, sir.	422.8425167106764
A ghoststory.	5863.030725352058
— Where do you begin in this?	377.49944410359166
Stephen asked, opening another book.	1635.5410182338403
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	1665.4743418801893
— And the story, sir?	189.71410693598466
— After, Stephen said.	661.383428658194
Go on, Talbot.	1358.8230582063218
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	892.3663543192583
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	1581.6479528737611
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	1218.5450925167859
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	5078.514539541747
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	1522.8751848684365
Thought is the thought of thought.	904.0711184983344
Tranquil brightness.	18805.655811000855
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	466.16661872708926
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	2594.7298490033068
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	1483.8528905920277
I don ’ t see anything.	931.1596808356353
— What, sir?	145.16681919687557
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	2596.882355662749
His hand turned the page over.	1323.3310803083589
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	1012.3949884582287
Of him that walked the waves.	1102.99358719113
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	1400.4154345502268
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	967.7824470412122
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	257.63103684387823
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	690.5423745480118
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	5652.379311053348
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	1330.0239167467896
— Have I heard all?	294.52672292138925
Stephen asked.	2112.661370998925
— Yes, sir.	717.4852047500266
Hockey at ten, sir.	2132.7924990004194
— Half day, sir.	1029.053647554389
Thursday.	5721.917308714802
— Who can answer a riddle?	516.6369247681513
Stephen asked.	2112.661370998925
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	4445.342516865688
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	1969.6313984339697
— O, ask me, sir.	515.797710761114
— A hard one, sir.	760.6641280787461
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	1022.0699702458678
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	1328.1090989657155
What is that?	146.2568293596765
— What, sir?	145.16681919687557
We didn ’ t hear.	1493.387318276233
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	2327.427792550831
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	351.72784961300573
We give it up.	1335.6887836098115
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	1063.6540483287433
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	1768.1907606523498
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	1205.3488453550883
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	785.1139822396706
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	1870.1890855506097
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	2570.9763752660583
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	1130.9232295330007
He held out his copybook.	553.329631341583
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	2806.666265637255
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	1417.8706877384193
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	2293.7070732344546
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	395.71102352827955
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	1062.0354405266896
Futility.	21558.06072352106
— Do you understand how to do them now?	448.07146685781913
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	2314.3519282512484
— Can you do them yourself?	445.7907632935461
Stephen asked.	2112.661370998925
— No, sir.	689.3190764608108
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	1018.0507432712155
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	754.4064287692437
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	2846.013598956883
Was that then real?	493.7644014649828
The only true thing in life?	435.25704573069714
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	4718.941869831762
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	432.2206739954717
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	2171.974244990917
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	1109.0474289699546
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	1030.0130039577084
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	1507.2055744120016
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	2923.359951371623
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	1134.226506033844
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	1356.7985111239927
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	1475.4958026086383
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	704.0875495045358
— Do you understand now?	405.3288863898332
Can you work the second for yourself?	501.8417305867653
— Yes, sir.	717.4852047500266
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	3777.4658418306526
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	1812.3859530857708
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	11385.261986660404
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	2311.734252412651
My childhood bends beside me.	3911.6719930015342
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	1112.2031886756547
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	1131.2535485996639
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	2156.224983590499
The sum was done.	1858.4902075510756
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	649.795733850224
— Yes, sir.	717.4852047500266
Thanks, Sargent answered.	2381.88329626854
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	861.2519699071647
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	658.13476018121
— Yes, sir.	717.4852047500266
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	914.3253255213157
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	642.1538494091789
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	2177.4685547419654
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	3135.4024958201
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	2328.6995813555773
He turned his angry white moustache.	2060.4773618207037
he cried continually without listening.	4586.700446304686
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	650.0908614396626
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	882.0202076360831
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	635.586624390388
What is it now?	201.79250240946803
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	1981.787373774587
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	2994.422803740678
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	1022.4877631315401
As it was in the beginning, is now.	452.8197067352595
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	832.666987493413
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	1043.3751237783226
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	1459.529380758316
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	2251.288707365332
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	655.7913439454657
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	855.582551184002
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	657.8343158473541
And now his strongroom for the gold.	1320.0039594072678
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	1743.5749636752455
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	1980.0062731799042
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	564.5547938688682
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	734.444317978488
These are handy things to have.	845.9018605492421
See.	4434.517156407201
This is for sovereigns.	2689.3162153877556
This is for shillings.	1664.936410377888
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	8797.848247759339
And here crowns.	2817.4531668795216
See.	4434.517156407201
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	1220.4953661819986
— Three twelve, he said.	760.9318543785256
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	563.7246501128324
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	420.01350923874855
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	761.4259861278223
You have earned it.	2642.2697470339117
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	592.3976293639638
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	1530.6747987580452
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	620.1655200995395
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	616.4273150608677
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	975.4736145949533
You just buy one of these machines.	2394.6517930175364
You ’ ll find them very handy.	791.7011890867427
Answer something.	8313.530026643122
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	1086.9300612974866
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	486.6890351708729
Three times now.	3236.979000756039
Three nooses round me here.	4689.160212476122
Well?	200.2722160773838
I can break them in this instant if I will.	979.065139522527
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	753.6756879984954
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	1143.1837462263552
When you have lived as long as I have.	960.815133695119
I know, I know.	473.8455205540382
If youth but knew.	3158.5061129099067
But what does Shakespeare say?	671.8437732479015
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	2259.229724083194
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	731.262579830285
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	696.8662372193744
He made money.	1918.9609889978674
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	888.304638047296
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	317.7174917284784
The seas ’ ruler.	2946.791065747439
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	1099.5312266888684
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	627.1924676511234
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	1698.3623044923534
That ’ s not English.	950.1230036766357
A French Celt said that.	2859.627129988781
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	3096.2953835463686
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	818.5712569232348
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	1460.7928974204224
_ — I paid my way.	806.6595667651721
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	617.2823037251736
_I owe <URL> Can you?	913.2359904434943
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	1419.1231237859715
Curran, ten guineas.	3812.880245278939
McCann, one guinea.	3334.1228993723635
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	4913.538271616607
Temple, two lunches.	1247.0583567173433
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	1484.843736004384
The lump I have is useless.	2216.1458200848942
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	515.5022036331994
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	2073.383928065852
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	741.376870122311
But one day you must feel it.	1149.626147105197
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	1593.0296860281376
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	1278.335985662148
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	1373.458994554306
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	1099.9327360724753
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	814.3752666415694
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	1512.6898307561303
You fenians forget some things.	5861.060881416488
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	2686.437806669225
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	3959.1233121694086
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	1493.7988516033422
The black north and true blue bible.	2318.397563454352
Croppies lie down.	9236.630956973957
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	4762.622793716544
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	787.1804086951333
On the spindle side.	3197.60140585396
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	2450.08884875326
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	1022.9815042462335
— Alas, Stephen said.	1053.4163369143532
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	1579.0205787999657
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	923.8354875487829
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	1487.2429040595143
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	12795.985659236825
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	2494.7508300076383
Day!...	18703.386501304252
Day!...	18703.386501304252
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	5210.644030290238

Lal the ral the raddy.	5400.209522645391
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	861.1369012443369
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	695.2598625044512
I have a letter here for the press.	667.7589452717295
Sit down a moment.	1787.0927296828677
I have just to copy the end.	817.4250265555353
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	702.0723647917953
— Sit down.	1869.8742004277403
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	1114.270559496069
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	758.3484788142038
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	5073.727435997561
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	1280.3927461318415
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	3231.837497089601
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	1657.221452057977
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	3881.049881472323
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	2366.0725238036666
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	1621.8844444826677
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	2307.7393641771305
Again: a goal.	1645.6581643037862
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	1109.7818080800675
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	1467.4539366937472
Jousts.	15787.963800563719
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	6549.995995188386
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	1580.9220709521505
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	726.2128222242272
Stephen stood up.	1768.8745828222857
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	772.2114548710921
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	707.3573418538198
Just look through it.	1838.1968614569932
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	619.948999607922
May I trespass on your valuable space.	3806.2584697660964

— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	370.6593062928128
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	1288.8029574154862

Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	1706.5947631238275
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	537.2440141648375
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	2065.513098493313
And it can be cured.	1405.6550542399602
It is cured.	2246.2130022874044
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	2361.397679196939
They offer to come over here.	1593.6114482671874
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	1048.4442252847643
I am surrounded by difficulties, by...	5534.415732501202

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	1730.046837972182
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	534.4894395303479
England is in the hands of the jews.	536.8087938711324
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	1053.6931204436585
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	755.0282097912541
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	1443.316204837115
I have seen it coming these years.	1345.984925560795
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	2036.019578089548
Old England is dying.	3513.2984285305474
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	1303.2762660521219
He faced about and back again.	1460.8963838377572
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	638.8106541603689
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	1070.6478963170725
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	1973.5273154513998
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	607.1411238401167
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	1033.261528934334
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	728.3986778727678
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	893.1353747620329
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	3498.587268104921
Gabble of geese.	5568.895419275939
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	3091.128091262418
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	1824.270099356084
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	2002.053364661077
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	2056.8154626939468
Time surely would scatter all.	5378.472228195773
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	2765.251578525966
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	962.7138925694404
— Who has not?	275.7115527767597
Stephen said.	1342.343346619359
— What do you mean?	300.97869704785415
Mr Deasy asked.	2450.2291072169123
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	834.8511308020909
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	6682.3737021362185
Is this old wisdom?	656.4117194642922
He waits to hear from me.	1028.553764058328
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	704.4291684991682
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	1684.6660512632027
A whirring whistle: goal.	4548.032583228565
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	648.1432423451377
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	846.4347116579318
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	2288.3208003370214
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	942.1800586501232
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	1112.5002470702225
Mr Deasy asked.	2450.2291072169123
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	790.3506505030604
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	1370.909406891124
Looking up again he set them free.	1787.4907181684505
— I am happier than you are, he said.	744.7310343036662
We have committed many errors and many sins.	1439.033958992423
A woman brought sin into the world.	1459.3435309584163
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	1026.8042180588243
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	982.0494530205541
A woman too brought Parnell low.	2733.5070398246366
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	2045.5955986860522
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	916.3417356137301
But I will fight for the right till the end.	791.5302065299359
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	2573.085406475763
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	859.4401447427606
— Well, sir, he began.	534.4373315646143
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	798.3246712589793
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	801.2339228943576
Perhaps I am wrong.	2616.1877431066314
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	1384.1567703422033
And here what will you learn more?	541.8667775842479
Mr Deasy shook his head.	1902.430980697643
— Who knows?	322.893126791533
he said.	856.4235297911396
To learn one must be humble.	3476.7829979678672
But life is the great teacher.	1921.230370389379
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	2551.435017440687
— As regards these, he began.	1206.8262306910353
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	724.3862377479853
You have two copies there.	2764.4188775156267
If you can have them published at once.	1849.1153844088637
_ Telegraph.	4220.229196631971
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	598.2802938861364
I know two editors slightly.	3899.678024532329
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	528.1316097018436
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	1580.223452104336
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	861.3643544894979
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	1148.2580281071355
What are they?	223.74358833125848
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	1840.4462998609772
There is no time to lose.	1224.1621693134816
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	1072.444146468612
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	499.65281813235686
Thank you.	2367.521374822112
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	729.9939222919032
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	639.1318607328219
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	570.1337855657877
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	829.7209798899459
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	2275.92082521808
Still I will help him in his fight.	1032.324949929017
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	2142.3216899583203
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	1665.375520992947
No more letters, I hope.	1116.3181498688239
— Just one moment.	1669.4314318638328
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	446.5551671086148
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	1982.7301779915995
— I just wanted to say, he said.	452.91233166175994
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	816.9469569689672
Do you know that?	255.30436033741128
No. And do you know why?	1057.600877637168
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	1555.0107769037459
— Why, sir?	180.8423656134393
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	1097.9960056596426
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	885.0694161146638
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	532.0424349157292
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	660.1736607973882
That ’ s why.	946.076984505532
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	2470.213378337191
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	1091.3793719085393
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	1446.035630118993
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	5714.070228504985
Limits of the diaphane.	3742.3968211374704
But he adds: in bodies.	1704.1589616333586
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	1200.1080209034394
How?	176.91223264362307
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	2347.7305938596196
Go easy.	5936.555867089946
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	4934.645976154459
Limit of the diaphane in.	2136.1356486881054
Why in?	150.30032083817397
Diaphane, adiaphane.	7879.416060000074
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	730.5730650963433
Shut your eyes and see.	1326.076286582445
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	881.2351405841521
You are walking through it howsomever.	3143.389209214001
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	1604.47081200212
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	1630.3736920560293
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	1431.1210710422886
Open your eyes.	2750.2276107050857
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	1284.228634997763
My ash sword hangs at my side.	1931.5978774242274
Tap with it: they do.	766.173399115182
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	838.1306803321596
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	5214.429194397851
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	1576.4819685068123
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	2845.797354950347
Wild sea money.	7575.504496737573
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	4195.688173482472
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	610.2998684343607
Rhythm begins, you see.	2423.1952174916614
I hear.	1491.2428240445274
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	13502.763875368631
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	4179.302649550063
Open your eyes now.	2282.951403909897
I will.	1200.429911246102
One moment.	3733.8357319168895
Has all vanished since?	303.0827592802725
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	955.4611057455629
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	1127.662288561605
See now.	2976.24691166865
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	682.3238585750191
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	2227.0380386064044
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	1203.428836352533
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	1598.6739656617628
From the liberties, out for the day.	687.6247204789507
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	2265.8671807493556
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	4069.015028401613
Creation from nothing.	5493.881668694297
What has she in the bag?	254.74208598817157
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	2465.77097669379
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	1548.7330243273425
That is why mystic monks.	4697.393588869532
Will you be as gods?	471.3847419562329
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	5610.279686263101
Hello.	4990.896473038367
Kinch here.	3768.3382698437576
Put me on to Edenville.	2173.3026374050805
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	598.516189791376
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	5902.554206274439
She had no navel.	2841.0762761371507
Gaze.	13137.782459902772
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	1944.737528748747
Womb of sin.	4347.62331170005
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	1933.3367652974923
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	611.8181999954621
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	1206.2719392549716
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	10202.26862966017
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	698.6916853797998
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	1946.048289331893
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	3666.1286224538812
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	4361.862644631768
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	3245.478720110013
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	6361.767288164412
They are coming, waves.	1327.475404984474
The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.	3518.823813802272
I mustn ’ t forget his letter for the press.	1015.3164661016316
And after?	191.7429247727484
The Ship, half twelve.	2406.8951815321407
By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.	1342.2771500775586
His pace slackened.	10489.46778023696
Here.	4163.460194123237
Am I going to aunt Sara ’ s or not?	552.0851087844806
My consubstantial father ’ s voice.	1919.9917535495367
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately?	836.6298476451339
No?	148.9385804351602
Sure he ’ s not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt Sally?	922.383536547048
Couldn ’ t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?	531.1561288723077
And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	306.7686710454404
O, weeping God, the things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	1105.6272474664806
The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player.	1800.7232875607388
Highly respectable gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir.	5028.610943840912
Yes, sir.	986.1763453947318
No, sir.	939.9037845980909
Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ! I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.	992.8294727646229
They take me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.	1640.6505811849545

Let Stephen in.	1296.729133579134
A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.	4184.746760997647
— We thought you were someone else.	1640.8906305739174
In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	2664.776851958868
Cleanchested.	21558.06072352106
He has washed the upper moiety.	2880.586904196701
— Morrow, nephew.	4054.4239623645003
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_.	2942.758324452246
A bogoak frame over his bald head: Wilde ’ s _Requiescat_.	1525.7916968492457

Walter squints vainly for a chair.	5828.966704312997

Bring in our chippendale chair.	5289.057091782928
Would you like a bite of something?	379.6761657312429
None of your damned lawdeedaw airs here.	2757.9591548356548
The rich of a rasher fried with a herring?	833.5199699814738
Sure?	310.1744137190059
So much the better.	1422.485030380697
The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera.	892.1072266217482
Listen.	5798.655857615648
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	2107.5905015062135
This wind is sweeter.	5347.709532442914

You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army.	1044.3051526101308
Come out of them, Stephen.	536.6896369488653
Beauty is not there.	506.8133828732334
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh ’ s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.	3090.904513768358
For whom?	461.77984931472434
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	4960.438733040469
A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars.	835.4811077578398
Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.	10605.877533883464

Paff! _Descende, calve, ut ne nimium decalveris_.	15454.434294525623
A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace (_descende! _), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	1898.01535893971
Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	1999.6944975912297
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	1056.3281603264788
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	3383.126253978688
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek.	2342.22275375968
Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back.	846.0785921427281
Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor.	2958.0342878190863
A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain.	5952.031648487665
Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.	820.3484425834725
Isle of saints.	681.559104644759

You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose.	963.8886395029091
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street.	1484.3305682400219
_O si, certo! _ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw.	2342.076891701652
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women! _ What about that, eh?	785.5216238090529
What about what?	241.10564797619452
What else were they invented for?	242.1126362397201
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	1814.7097670731343
I was young.	894.104014981501
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face.	1090.9785946584977

O yes, W.	1222.9003840576104
Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	1047.6602829154938
Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara.	1127.1493938798035

The grainy sand had gone from under his feet.	2309.3181168702704
His boots trod again a damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.	2596.8192142241583

Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?	289.51109382395083
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	1606.8706432706003
Turn back.	3672.2262971494097
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	1117.5647699780852
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	2288.661168573439
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	2025.030133061627
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	1448.8802074265016
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	1570.2663776151373
Who to clear it?	295.18098689532536
He has the key.	1096.3108162803744
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	1271.3611265778352
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	1630.9374506752254
Call: no answer.	2226.0657021562747
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	571.1508044388866
Take all, keep all.	1053.600707100989
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	1169.0382101022608
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	1519.3424651275734
The flood is following me.	1770.0457371478865
I can watch it flow past from here.	1459.2143679132855
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	1207.9020824707802
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	1040.2086309073536
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	4926.449941001165
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	25155.984828976463
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	4610.6325266033355
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	2613.799810215376
Hide gold there.	5490.2619802795725
Try it.	2361.4495778114797
You have some.	1591.3926361401134
Sands and stones.	5480.686183891844
Heavy of the past.	1411.5944928335182
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	5603.59830677268
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	986.356149314775
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	1904.137015360618
Feefawfum.	21558.06072352106
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	20930.7413665511
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	1582.6286245321903
Lord, is he going to attack me?	148.32820568808302
Respect his liberty.	7615.9342531462335
You will not be master of others or their slave.	707.6687135135309
I have my stick.	1255.2203871978047
Sit tight.	6521.342389488245
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	1915.7830203051994
The two maries.	4986.911500585878
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	3458.8295787975635
Peekaboo.	21558.06072352106
I see you.	806.1963372020997
No, the dog.	632.0354952459057
He is running back to them.	848.5187130992136
Who?	176.13832567394323
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	3754.288854957526
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	4353.115808937504
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	4378.0192020035165
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	2418.9494940303484
Famine, plague and slaughters.	1982.820614972437
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	1374.1166970155275
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	796.5383590957629
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	704.0870181509389
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	610.6398438725444
Dog of my enemy.	2683.1838258513826
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	1616.691914204867
_Terribilia meditans_.	50041.95876441744
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	1154.5147737839131
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	307.2695346841206
Pretenders: live their lives.	4493.5719632662485
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	1085.7753682167488
All kings ’ sons.	2580.6090204230645
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	2633.451532824399
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	1585.5555953448227
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	4439.8681423501885
House of...	14301.761459014884
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	2420.02049497409
Would you do what he did?	372.19492651559807
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	1580.3839818758513
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	1286.4693266792292
Would you or would you not?	335.8636299468894
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	1699.841683183664
They are waiting for him now.	1151.2176984685539
The truth, spit it out.	954.6511145696413
I would want to.	826.7180346254638
I would try.	1653.1037174598175
I am not a strong swimmer.	2195.778559809498
Water cold soft.	9184.02516728121
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	857.1351360584831
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	341.2452334787928
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	1094.7808672660483
If I had land under my feet.	1445.9860148198725
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	562.5684744366936
A drowning man.	2408.321202139733
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	1039.023194263343
I...	17944.762614703475
With him together down...	8716.362679146974
I could not save her.	1065.913091208922
Waters: bitter death: lost.	3669.545865705315
A woman and a man.	621.4323200378308
I see her skirties.	2447.605354360687
Pinned up, I bet.	1752.6843236971235
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	2122.6026551450555
Looking for something lost in a past life.	1215.0219231426074
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	1597.4970758955133
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	2359.9062968649737
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	707.083906314167
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	2556.3030540893437
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	2393.468324694525
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	4581.298104551484
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	1072.5306652691938
Cocklepickers.	21558.06072352106
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	711.9800980082493
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	2160.7084722797754
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	1534.9031295840562
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	2095.6435250969826
The carcass lay on his path.	2157.9389759505707
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	1322.8843203169665
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	1459.8502563816978
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	605.2391689033772
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	1293.296276060634
He slunk back in a curve.	1840.9286569935089
Doesn ’ t see me.	1159.130109646319
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	1165.526318203638
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	1661.6975477676524
The simple pleasures of the poor.	452.58036079353457
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	4737.687869174048
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	709.6849418140893
Wait.	4301.167531310137
Street of harlots.	4144.815913559566
Remember.	5586.4793434236
Haroun al Raschid.	37974.64965274704
I am almosting it.	2706.305756413959
That man led me, spoke.	1283.515747354969
I was not afraid.	1042.2625165786014
The melon he had he held against my face.	1449.7199743515937
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	11301.751835809182
That was the rule, said.	524.9990136686715
Red carpet spread.	7591.688335081551
You will see who.	1569.540522933795
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	2021.9304625992497
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	4542.084087580513
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	1984.3970566357914
Spoils slung at her back.	3487.3741480830954
About her windraw face hair trailed.	9436.024339317813
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	3546.8406838873316
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	3499.093305373943
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	3157.8254505711934
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	3606.8804022002178
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	1836.915794148387
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	5535.8341742718
Couch a hogshead with me then.	3368.045878590882
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	1089.447808044817
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	31195.789128006883
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	8255.260686759437
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	7830.733061579772
Language no whit worse than his.	6554.46455730797
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	8092.033530782729
Passing now.	6159.581785113169
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	1754.6961583924299
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	705.9257315826733
I am not.	1116.8670502000057
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	3486.0682767978697
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	2075.030500959182
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	2136.8872938627583
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	1914.2605724656194
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	1921.5350151311532
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	2258.3212561108526
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	30329.476755550942
Here.	4163.460194123237
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	332.20035681535745
My tablets.	12851.221264423966
Mouth to her kiss.	1631.1010338300027
No. Must be two of em.	3015.1751058130394
Glue em well.	11872.264850299402
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	929.9143406348414
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	3531.9969541989335
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	15413.929377257216
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	6175.79205215686
Paper.	21558.06072352106
The banknotes, blast them.	803.8769474303801
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	1587.6340804161098
Here.	4163.460194123237
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	390.54712036760367
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	700.7673921926173
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	704.2563312411822
Why not endless till the farthest star?	2122.6997121283503
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	1218.4162662180877
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	1746.4262257254122
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	1603.7701875851349
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	497.44725435442535
Who watches me here?	570.5847003114081
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	1419.7505936398638
Signs on a white field.	2362.125754741859
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	2659.692409353987
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	1377.3472438108124
Hold hard.	5411.578535247881
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	716.078913436583
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	649.0058480228494
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	1971.02927013632
Click does the trick.	4618.3246024319205
You find my words dark.	2217.680986972321
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	794.1035823648818
Flutier.	21558.06072352106
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	880.9663781644102
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	1377.4457953947972
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	738.1158540800624
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	5570.584326498443
She, she, she.	382.93205663037253
What she?	166.41690292673402
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	1593.144760614902
Keen glance you gave her.	3776.4290462738204
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	5211.008515041115
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	1302.4921662957404
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	2058.289329576744
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	4511.658504688581
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	7707.126859348708
Where are your wits?	592.7696591554528
Touch me.	2945.7011864989618
Soft eyes.	3806.842969016482
Soft soft soft hand.	4390.960935806294
I am lonely here.	2026.6196474960627
O, touch me soon, now.	767.3894237125319
What is that word known to all men?	386.42249064182
I am quiet here alone.	2226.158708137929
Sad too.	3556.2309658238178
Touch, touch me.	1492.407985393592
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	863.7944182553622
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	1316.690807566007
_Et vidit Deus.	51114.76288880746
Et erant valde bona_.	73218.97235641707
Alo! _Bonjour_.	16895.666869458062
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	7534.575766639514
I am caught in this burning scene.	1847.3932269163236
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	1976.1836262189943
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	5708.886011450396
Pain is far.	4273.81888248542
And no more turn aside and brood.	1820.5172414592591
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	2219.0119057103752
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	2404.5750312516434
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	1607.3222630465857
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	1536.9569756823657
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	2379.7624643949816
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	1290.4054612288044
He now will leave me.	1422.2102424857196
And the blame?	217.48773975763092
As I am.	1742.8973430052008
As I am.	1742.8973430052008
All or not at all.	883.6200030372538
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	2924.165242117865
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	589.3468649466338
Better get this job over quick.	2847.2929460709283
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	5496.549600300975
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	4631.393658672339
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	1643.7522835565856
And, spent, its speech ceases.	828.2542137865761
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	6621.33970993192
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	4681.614663120187
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	1311.8518082254654
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	4446.912750488803
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	3267.8432089151047
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	1308.9768840025688
Five fathoms out there.	3973.4246200428984
Full fathom five thy father lies.	7789.753175308017
At one, he said.	596.7314570726056
Found drowned.	14887.63821703105
High water at Dublin bar.	3003.175615663093
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	1653.810358421633
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	3805.5106842714827
There he is.	984.774545916147
Hook it quick.	5253.8281773141425
Pull.	11695.605131062071
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	2917.950164803685
We have him.	1309.451247442144
Easy now.	7713.985081772869
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	11950.108803226787
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	2516.29145147843
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	10653.638001486082
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	3791.9012637920555
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	3029.4260026447937
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	4121.362303186455
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	2292.0788131567474
Old Father Ocean.	8840.655962019346
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	10984.318774647407
Just you give it a fair trial.	1834.9347067834346
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	9283.669933414301
Come.	3769.4841282972616
I thirst.	2174.435392921591
Clouding over.	9441.367989040455
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	604.6636958742843
Thunderstorm.	21558.06072352106
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	1684.1161627487172
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	8254.278216954433
Where?	188.90416504930744
To evening lands.	1268.119786424885
Evening will find itself.	1399.6548282074414
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	1271.0024682143546
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	792.7302985599711
All days make their end.	2423.707863269149
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	1101.2198899866223
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	2129.3209056475157
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	6679.321072080331
_Già_.	15787.963800563719
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	1048.3312237966682
_Già_.	15787.963800563719
My teeth are very bad.	2817.9857105241304
Why, I wonder.	906.7649829169708
Feel.	5762.592979701144
That one is going too.	1190.7281563417264
Shells.	21558.06072352106
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	323.57764698045014
That one.	1745.043204021341
This.	4240.008797606501
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	3805.8271457136934
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	382.4508147018229
My handkerchief.	4494.17723778535
He threw it.	1456.2975341478018
I remember.	1737.622167673506
Did I not take it up?	315.37083753015384
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	3607.8457172706217
No, I didn ’ t.	564.3742885020613
Better buy one.	3437.030221434343
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	1791.2192891893599
For the rest let look who will.	1454.881785790812
Behind.	5659.915422629268
Perhaps there is someone.	2391.91799174361
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	1476.853978208149
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	2261.277442845398
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	1896.493616079071
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	3958.0544706743267
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	2601.4102008971936
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	1624.306443895855
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	1732.8590008080673
Made him feel a bit peckish.	1440.4734940293954
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	1036.973480733887
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	1288.0878583124465
Right.	5268.119875574054
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	482.976157640075
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	1677.1734462306367
Cup of tea soon.	887.3895657621678
Good.	3917.763028917056
Mouth dry.	6644.190661398353
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	1310.3937415944197
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	1777.9442879429591
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	4481.284494563706
Prr.	15787.963800563719
Scratch my head.	4970.573221572587
Prr.	15787.963800563719
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	2514.2544014742634
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	847.9150737584258
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	541.7245145181694
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	970.3880273650707
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	1978.3816532123542
They call them stupid.	2730.221124321669
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	2002.1891982387308
She understands all she wants to.	1753.6656956196264
Vindictive too.	9521.420078950294
Cruel.	11695.605131062071
Her nature.	3934.3509456991483
Curious mice never squeal.	13993.537112120688
Seem to like it.	1965.3112110513846
Wonder what I look like to her.	799.6862294724798
Height of a tower?	579.3253194419465
No, she can jump me.	453.16762425693673
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	499.16661113789263
Afraid of the chookchooks.	758.4256957270619
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	1879.2879784831928
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	2416.9834510955043
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	1932.0923094610525
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	815.233563394732
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	1462.5028637638434
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	2597.0888742722063
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	869.1666923299833
Why?	190.44911106412906
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	851.8015958517831
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	1013.3655402725915
He listened to her licking lap.	2353.6996768902195
Ham and eggs, no.	1550.0402056778746
No good eggs with this drouth.	2176.4167947789774
Want pure fresh water.	5603.355210982266
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	1203.496907679284
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	1788.5674111726466
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	723.7729518046704
While the kettle is boiling.	2115.4639794361387
Why are their tongues so rough?	832.0683951440333
To lap better, all porous holes.	1647.134804209512
Nothing she can eat?	704.0557872598838
He glanced round him.	1568.1195102195795
She might like something tasty.	3210.3375697348843
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	1815.1994029512741
Still perhaps: once in a way.	959.8992569455778
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	606.9443180001575
Be back in a minute.	1343.5027653800933
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	511.58858316136747
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	5647.122203988267
Must get those settled really.	3685.410313015944
Pity.	5846.311267724853
All the way from Gibraltar.	1176.8496293607277
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	3935.011801873733
Wonder what her father gave for it.	1104.1849689623396
Old style.	5678.625079597136
Ah yes! of course.	1159.4799250377032
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	593.8221716640779
Got a short knock.	2822.6127231109517
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	1334.5070345109114
Yes, sir.	986.1763453947318
At Plevna that was.	2341.0185176518753
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	444.7922893196401
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	1217.4461383821695
Now that was farseeing.	3214.4878520459465
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	1612.408234387749
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	14800.691641019464
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	1958.410847027251
Course they do.	2408.402265831578
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	984.8010758704135
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	1726.548060048269
White slip of paper.	2624.3401037849712
Quite safe.	6814.734082725343
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	1075.1949113352637
In the trousers I left off.	963.0270868808424
Must get it.	1738.3629115229417
Potato I have.	2686.6523674847786
Creaky wardrobe.	39616.09131016968
No use disturbing her.	5189.1485105269985
She turned over sleepily that time.	2360.0840206513353
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	1176.0774623234033
Looked shut.	11131.488465205011
All right till I come back anyhow.	1758.7949271698033
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	2097.0456407439756
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	1345.8635720400628
Be a warm day I fancy.	1758.6470549873325
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	2812.3338628693728
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	1056.0226695305
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	901.3487390638104
Make a picnic of it.	995.8839113969652
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	2519.498926345184
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	4923.741586141451
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	1509.8020368098162
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	506.30273841282025
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	2132.081879548991
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	736.1350792008221
Wander through awned streets.	21829.604787179516
Turbaned faces going by.	5860.137042792165
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	1688.7342537408908
Cries of sellers in the streets.	2649.212747716643
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	5850.837580080626
Dander along all day.	4732.095637900588
Might meet a robber or two.	2011.0061074698367
Well, meet him.	1097.9207877717408
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	1438.3802979743953
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	788.1511892562208
I pass on.	1140.8090670387583
Fading gold sky.	13412.809378425527
A mother watches me from her doorway.	1567.6066485697502
She calls her children home in their dark language.	1629.1188617631703
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	2600.9776881947664
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	974.6087119008812
Strings.	21558.06072352106
Listen.	5798.655857615648
I pass.	1829.6167653386146
Probably not a bit like it really.	1210.1560730549968
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	684.9788736243484
Sunburst on the titlepage.	4713.1871969725
He smiled, pleasing himself.	2178.707877630368
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	1530.6379336514726
He prolonged his pleased smile.	2393.3298168256915
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	2658.0112646756575
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	1145.092353128903
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	4488.9255913839625
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	3004.0989181255873
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	790.9213418811665
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	958.392446335084
g.	11695.605131062071
as position.	2617.8800152303834
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	855.8243766999308
Baldhead over the blind.	3275.504221093063
Cute old codger.	18094.371706272203
No use canvassing him for an ad.	2535.2859490027254
Still he knows his own business best.	1816.220317743929
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	1610.1694659074742
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	803.5592994073825
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	357.26409233311057
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	196.09935504121992
Do you know what?	331.5338792822679
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	1311.4856256621317
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	867.05592721265
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	1229.3360457177523
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	912.8896733348502
— Good day to you.	780.330714043463
— Lovely weather, sir.	1403.9862031885525
— ’ Tis all that.	714.5003761675314
Where do they get the money?	365.7398686617182
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	3427.497679236115
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	2628.3687572229487
Then think of the competition.	396.4374254033321
General thirst.	7002.436774708337
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	3211.9091382117513
Save it they can ’ t.	976.972324093317
Off the drunks perhaps.	3859.786123259212
Put down three and carry five.	2365.497242111148
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	752.634173520121
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	3498.37944651257
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	406.0252725975018
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	520.76205245172
Say ten barrels of stuff.	3251.06085183282
Say he got ten per cent off.	2873.7145602945297
O more.	1845.3087184480453
Fifteen.	5659.915422629268
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	1976.8399679158695
Brats ’ clamour.	10209.199652144358
Windows open.	13305.387339859226

Slieve Bloom.	5306.414779454227
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	713.7409956888445
Fifteen multiplied by.	5566.372048211606
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	1082.4526647349394
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	1830.0846557630764
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	3388.9404118212497
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	1154.5472193401197
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	596.6666972678648
Chapped: washingsoda.	15342.753049983246
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	869.6388323967997
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	2916.6499350223
Woods his name is.	2383.5322643300315
Wonder what he does.	1740.0770852344683
Wife is oldish.	7978.069812735154
New blood.	5705.0911702145395
No followers allowed.	11040.515464542812
Strong pair of arms.	3426.376318387179
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	3466.8622312832777
She does whack it, by George.	1164.7611834117552
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	3155.9209294122925
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	4827.314940184787
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	1040.7889680224876
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	14018.09333239222
Moses Montefiore.	13222.034219989166
I thought he was.	683.4570936554163
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	3502.242092852083
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	841.6128361978986
A young white heifer.	4100.186896750879
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	1214.9674773772288
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	1315.379403060744
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	1283.4013243293623
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	918.6034337248987
— Now, my miss, he said.	462.99010531511294
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	1127.0176127297234
— Thank you, my miss.	844.783455782472
And one shilling threepence change.	1285.7639290826012
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	2533.0538250934574
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	1465.3502659504488
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	1124.141053393798
Hurry up, damn it.	1105.4528568951305
Make hay while the sun shines.	4228.379043966936
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	1276.720492204475
Sodachapped hands.	12130.168961011705
Crusted toenails too.	16338.43416288692
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	7522.320633606009
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	4191.4224610581905
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	1781.4188009999657
They like them sizeable.	3880.3046271349112
Prime sausage.	34515.85074510494
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	673.6704171093293
— Threepence, please.	2472.5009257727033
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	1931.8695464893276
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	1471.3486148795723
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	450.25581969980624
— Thank you, sir.	769.0393312644545
Another time.	3670.250999779564
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	907.5573285355355
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	2334.90335471796
No: better not: another time.	1042.366842055255
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	640.5057687747018
— Good morning, sir.	978.1540583546039
No sign.	3663.40829499956
Gone.	5762.592979701144
What matter?	304.1750704224172
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	2291.581244609611
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	3840.789787963474
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	6839.279773990507
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	1267.5533897191754
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	7105.668487381506
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	1265.2368116018188
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	17155.572407865875
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	1300.5233485281785
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	585.2397955926829
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	2795.2088024574655
Bleibtreustrasse <NUM>, Berlin, W.	2011.7544333943692
<NUM>.	1962.0030324179404
Nothing doing.	5678.625079597136
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	1230.4038330390272
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	50041.95876441744
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	5644.3787657979865
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	658.6622653287201
I have a few left from Andrews.	1415.8596817492214
Molly spitting them out.	779.3235996649939
Knows the taste of them now.	1000.3796701885577
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	1261.3109306973085
Citrons too.	7537.70349050344
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	1050.2446243547822
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	1750.9895370569984
Pleasant evenings we had then.	4072.805604785236
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	2085.533854849706
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	750.6657857498511
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	887.68577371096
Always the same, year after year.	1145.381379612726
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	3203.965290181061
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	4016.8493006562617
Must be without a flaw, he said.	965.6332598025289
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	1085.2285469857777
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	3219.125294167327
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	1032.7840369553344
How do you?	254.64582116296455
Doesn ’ t see.	1398.2290316611923
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	1105.1954025606392
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	1245.547571647895
Watering cart.	18763.011041933474
To provoke the rain.	4038.9055040369603
On earth as it is in heaven.	1057.9611061711787
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	807.5209363641906
Grey.	11695.605131062071
Far.	5798.655857615648
No, not like that.	543.136780022484
A barren land, bare waste.	3482.7696600956247
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	1456.579252347102
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	3513.8097857021967
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	2112.5084728915235
All dead names.	3795.48112208348
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	728.9811347180128
Old now.	3025.5941324491578
It bore the oldest, the first race.	1141.5892436400673
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	1586.440517982087
The oldest people.	4964.402652319848
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	1788.900400585912
It lay there now.	1867.6955144779342
Now it could bear no more.	1846.677395107484
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	979.9187097930394
Desolation.	21558.06072352106
Grey horror seared his flesh.	9929.72024991249
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	2545.0881725220625
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	2120.2292987618275
Well, I am here now.	882.1753755898914
Yes, I am here now.	813.5221093186827
Morning mouth bad images.	8164.34286167032
Got up wrong side of the bed.	1168.8136066537993
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	580.0474150431047
On the hands down.	1163.527606491685
Blotchy brown brick houses.	20392.24062477386
Number eighty still unlet.	17418.562830107516
Why is that?	190.38623104268217
Valuation is only twentyeight.	9074.374344462172
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	1434.81306867718
Plasters on a sore eye.	3232.9223200105
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	1344.9126390885951
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	9021.091588161236
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	2984.3684195104556
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	748.8160592921456
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	1458.2245408435608
He stooped and gathered them.	1488.2678817907924
Mrs Marion Bloom.	2668.269411917123
His quickened heart slowed at once.	7241.355307374248
Bold hand.	745.1831145000009
Mrs Marion.	4064.4606754849665
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	2507.6697629415644
— Who are the letters for?	257.97493030763343
He looked at them.	1108.933460867377
Mullingar.	5827.72223398114
Milly.	4726.769801346335
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	414.8769115856266
And a letter for you.	713.2198481748019
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	1401.2376803748975
— Do you want the blind up?	327.6095638313385
— That do?	207.013115128306
he asked, turning.	889.1362700743618
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	540.6169038521589
— She got the things, she said.	497.8661310708843
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	1081.4033139840353
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	586.7815102596079
I ’ m parched.	2057.110193449203
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	673.8967129172072
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	727.0278352634175
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	537.5627310264423
— Scald the teapot.	2791.13987335416
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	1471.1345892676366
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	1340.1872993597674
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	1005.6988355233048
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	1697.5735859019205
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	1971.116592785989
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	2192.801145916434
Kosher.	11695.605131062071
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	1257.8761264987302
Pepper.	15787.963800563719
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	1005.7394652781313
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	2960.019591915512
The tea was drawn.	1817.796789817243
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	1381.129783738465
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	2589.9684597876417
No, wait: four.	1022.0343333626702
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	2619.7933199072113
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	1831.919114554247
He smiled, pouring.	1398.7292548596004
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	1503.242079049673
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	1585.865263945899
Poor old professor Goodwin.	4035.3025724272297
Dreadful old case.	5825.29814475845
Still he was a courteous old chap.	1650.255461371321
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	2528.879039000362
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	861.6381413494051
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	839.5611351533015
Sex breaking out even then.	4535.604709976205
Pert little piece she was.	3552.9871407109913
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	729.9453326663306
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	2853.581084755802
Everything on it?	64.90420367573422
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	1447.5501099052024
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	892.3769849487536
— What a time you were! she said.	486.71734450758544
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	1969.3882893412874
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	1038.7689029756423
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	3739.997036038521
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	811.988028356719
— Who was the letter from?	216.3802464488082
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
Bold hand.	745.1831145000009
Marion.	5184.158288979094
— O, Boylan, she said.	413.62417557136087
He ’ s bringing the programme.	796.7067920256857
— What are you singing?	313.439785881798
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	2793.8797110403743
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	1178.395480512455
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	1377.8933272804761
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	4216.215674847249
Like foul flowerwater.	12004.258664692119
— Would you like the window open a little?	350.1827080904933
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	478.15760517821894
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	720.774442837584
I didn ’ t see the paper.	677.786218502027
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	945.9454190357186
No?	148.9385804351602
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	1653.199102719776
— No: that book.	810.0019318699497
Other stocking.	6855.240909265388
Her petticoat.	4934.894091308491
— It must have fell down, she said.	738.7305299434058
He felt here and there.	995.7543572319812
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	22981.54425497965
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	3309.4463222237573
Not in the bed.	804.2053990842289
Must have slid down.	2665.8234504972443
He stooped and lifted the valance.	2060.7860576627318
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	1793.1483216631632
— Show here, she said.	751.0467043180266
I put a mark in it.	628.4847305414529
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	612.9789870574958
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	803.023444991074
— Met him what?	99.13216989201885
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
What does that mean?	392.1497151163364
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	1532.9434826764964
— Metempsychosis?	437.0531345160757
— Yes.	1408.8980448614918
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	708.4391246731703
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	682.2461576591613
That means the transmigration of souls.	1920.8866645796056
— O, rocks! she said.	577.2110938479835
Tell us in plain words.	2284.771127329619
The same young eyes.	1641.4083082261675
The first night after the charades.	502.19627249848554
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	1702.0642638316372
He turned over the smudged pages.	2457.1816476467066
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	2473.591356227128
Hello.	4990.896473038367

Doped animals.	18398.820154549983
Trapeze at Hengler ’ s.	3283.2661375776925
Had to look the other way.	970.6434542478661
Mob gaping.	18805.655811000855
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	2107.67326723155
Families of them.	2938.6107325224834
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	6000.839025907847
That we live after death.	2345.3210306157534
Our souls.	5211.344484260634
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	752.3047504855967
Dignam ’ s soul...	6382.068448571003
— Did you finish it?	350.0515252935934
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
— Yes, she said.	518.3398894325522
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	1033.9151231805415
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	279.48644214258184
— Never read it.	1380.8642646410644
Do you want another?	483.2403941516976
— Yes.	1408.8980448614918
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	1602.5873809790244
Nice name he has.	1818.9060605292218
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	1815.267885156821
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	2276.109413179077
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	805.3537875903833
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	721.7414256113386
They call it reincarnation.	3697.772159989404
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	1258.3903598032753
They say we have forgotten it.	1507.3989845766253
Some say they remember their past lives.	2626.8771621573433
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	9813.171149998105
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	538.9737114040979
An example would be better.	2665.8497391579144
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	1628.7627526555814
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	4590.771505244973
Tea before you put milk in.	705.5210525781603
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	2366.0215384519656
Three and six I gave for the frame.	490.0075172878616
She said it would look nice over the bed.	929.3399992517766
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	531.2521220721513
He turned the pages back.	1141.8933110632656
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	1026.8976817142322
What they called nymphs, for example.	613.6225222466503
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	1014.7256666443436
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	2717.0323453714354
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	516.9811510920408
Did you leave anything on the fire?	480.6241769457701
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	1190.2736186604832
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	669.6335277788826
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	1533.3106141840562
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	1333.6896262661655
Only a little burnt.	733.4171027923347
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	1182.5587389862242
Cup of tea now.	607.9270719410832
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	567.7596008909004
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	2718.228511535392
Done to a turn.	1246.2315083552762
A mouthful of tea.	3200.326908737219
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	752.7150763418798
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	412.19286517903305
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	749.6802575914332
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	1843.065669833141
It suits me splendid.	3159.7396137105547
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	2041.6043626443723
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	1731.997512602387
They are lovely.	2320.085057073256
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	1369.310920740693
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	1145.2431061522357
Will send when developed.	4593.42670586141
We did great biz yesterday.	5925.375157904706
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	593.0272956652252
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	2079.786418295514
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	1182.9075291703864
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	522.8228921020814
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	1120.1754347035926
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	1155.259680512557
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	2388.80026414258
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	3744.4110593430037
S.	3386.8216662258314
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	3324.8043385363876
M.	3454.822785535615
Fifteen yesterday.	6624.348014949669
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	1407.1630486628171
Her first birthday away from home.	2503.7722824813295
Separation.	21558.06072352106
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	1548.912052431568
Jolly old woman.	815.7859686787042
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	450.2720063294809
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	1275.153212896738
Well, God is good, sir.	646.0813234304885
She knew at once.	1821.2107964157303
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	1130.9917987710508
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	4616.864381997953
Excuse bad writing.	5961.564647186978
Hurry.	5659.915422629268
Piano downstairs.	2492.876193676141
Coming out of her shell.	1352.8649943630455
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	2152.4851443682255
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	1601.5289556945816
Saucebox.	21558.06072352106
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	1472.2985587410526
Twelve and six a week.	1617.3979888756473
Not much.	3111.9700243331054
Still, she might do worse.	1340.0350994839082
Music hall stage.	6809.0773655874245
Young student.	6556.61759758003
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	1767.65811282159
Then he read the letter again: twice.	1052.0557320244973
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	927.3048691182128
But if not?	256.2005587309591
No, nothing has happened.	1555.522945351563
Wait in any case till it does.	1552.7126995706678
A wild piece of goods.	2255.6416192791517
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	2527.7479849529022
Destiny.	15787.963800563719
Ripening now.	9744.094144702127
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	873.2468291778665
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	1141.422174663169
Anemic a little.	3777.126240773086
Was given milk too long.	3374.8617631205525
Damned old tub pitching about.	13291.534230252979
Not a bit funky.	3992.621681951261
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	1472.4064790179
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	1867.0213191775645
Seaside girls.	12462.321785590486
Torn envelope.	14207.64879072596
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	772.5153902410755
Friend of the family.	1603.6642019388419
Swurls, he says.	1622.5246973765993
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	2823.0349260744015
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	2102.1967853666956
Milly too.	3050.8285181206293
Young kisses: the first.	1415.9833022472633
Far away now past.	3167.4931517349146
Mrs Marion.	4064.4606754849665
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	1502.965711199759
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	2511.7569729804973
Will happen, yes.	1968.0850746290957
Prevent.	21558.06072352106
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	1784.341437950354
Will happen too.	4060.6523827610044
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	2292.063210909816
Useless to move now.	766.9590327138542
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	2573.426181113405
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	3063.079851128787
Better where she is down there: away.	1071.1242722163713
Occupy her.	6742.465872461613
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	956.4788101478201
Might take a trip down there.	2471.369609824288
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	3013.9151851102333
Six weeks off, however.	2256.0250847995217
Might work a press pass.	3060.408965514187
Or through M ’ Coy.	2024.2557477885853
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	1187.478391002776
She looked back at him, mewing.	1263.806269534382
Wants to go out.	481.39266504030604
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	839.2312170575826
Let her wait.	2359.6377728620027
Has the fidgets.	3583.2923227098404
Electric.	15787.963800563719
Thunder in the air.	1948.1410789297538
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	846.5939041960278
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	751.0660907684097
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	571.0778225068485
The cat mewed to him.	1880.2763647601323
— Miaow! he said in answer.	1186.1311723418387
Wait till I ’ m ready.	1580.5459186028613
Heaviness: hot day coming.	4418.111914609882
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	1424.3200593540816
A paper.	2340.304787151106
He liked to read at stool.	1952.8351208287431
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	1043.5180090364556
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	2222.635340023853
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	390.9015019806701
The cat went up in soft bounds.	836.6770510903604
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	810.1921610011436
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	937.4613663209427
Come.	3769.4841282972616
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	1065.0785970884253
No sound.	3729.7170887883076
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	2808.08405468408
The maid was in the garden.	798.8925525245932
Fine morning.	4869.445150150261
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	1087.429327555977
Make a summerhouse here.	4011.8706490462064
Scarlet runners.	31362.37528359212
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	2656.3883786673036
A coat of liver of sulphur.	1971.8005290451977
All soil like that without dung.	2295.4944086775886
Household slops.	3614.235343929083
Loam, what is this that is?	385.0712036112417
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	2293.638935828492
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	1223.980667044131
Mulch of dung.	5580.698095958687
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	2397.3492894601295
Dirty cleans.	34515.85074510494
Ashes too.	7537.70349050344
Reclaim the whole place.	3846.1166017664955
Grow peas in that corner there.	3601.5916432421345
Lettuce.	21558.06072352106
Always have fresh greens then.	5417.872393385437
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	5488.165948636089
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	10556.845265839358
He walked on.	1244.4461477720354
Where is my hat, by the way?	224.93704444955142
Must have put it back on the peg.	1188.6406008238325
Or hanging up on the floor.	1327.7215780590907
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	1045.6758010899673
Hallstand too full.	7739.884673817961
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	4983.231075866267
Picking up the letters.	2591.267377955507
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	5639.556139280416
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	1397.6414430161972
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	5548.841515352864
Just had a wash and brushup.	2036.8085504868407
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	1058.4669831923063
Tara street.	3823.659371896694
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	1573.5228009251568
O ’ Brien.	1564.1927711926319
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	1552.9107062138291
Agendath what is it?	305.5736039294129
Now, my miss.	1275.3532922926204
Enthusiast.	21558.06072352106
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	724.4296886712475
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	1462.014696313346
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	1135.5072175746225
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	3671.3920767800714
The king was in his countinghouse.	1307.818970093342
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	1622.2534387991702
Something new and easy.	2327.168744321978
No great hurry.	3813.037230700586
Keep it a bit.	1230.2664041724577
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	5397.054335733128
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	3070.9563188953953
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	1217.7556923664984
Three and a half.	985.5993994159483
Three pounds three.	4549.0151666850625
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	1674.7159639549518
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	818.842739415439
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	1956.9117040983476
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	1455.6496666693206
No, just right.	1034.3929067355443
So. Ah! Costive.	11695.969875867328
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	17909.772301119327
Life might be so.	2197.0084180269955
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	1154.9327240654818
Print anything now.	7932.7390052342935
Silly season.	1358.7325991305374
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	1596.7583896540887
Neat certainly.	13854.071309865607
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	1568.6783761880565
Begins and ends morally.	10550.521374030033
_Hand in hand_.	11271.91889905539
Smart.	11695.605131062071
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	1130.823655585508

Dislike dressing together.	10056.061361288695
Nicked myself shaving.	3729.2348147773178

What possessed me to buy this comb?	349.65998134138096
<URL>.	2694.4121317158665
I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	1536.629284702027
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	666.7613842229861
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	7887.45037961303
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	1645.0385844691166
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	1028.3747425363138
Washing her teeth.	5612.027906596455
That was the first night.	770.6327634672635
Her fansticks clicking.	28689.233312859327
Is that Boylan well off?	520.6806722092822
He has money.	1777.9793916859915
Why?	190.44911106412906
No use humming then.	1126.8519584016763
Allude to it.	2579.4731130174982
Strange kind of music that last night.	1545.0005613809847
The mirror was in shadow.	1142.5606347406745
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	2383.1634241841098
Peering into it.	3639.813144457561
Lines in her eyes.	1994.4107308132848
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	1855.7665160530983
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	1417.100606687485
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	3271.006975624249
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	1282.8079288636
Still, true to life also.	1213.4528613185073
Day: then the night.	971.7358678035987
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	928.2028791600476
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	1893.2700139073668
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	1254.4477847830651
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	817.9935528021267
What time is the funeral?	265.42253525238715
Better find out in the paper.	1031.9049562235361
The bells of George ’ s church.	990.9413436581077
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	3065.1083345636566
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	1959.756448818788
There again: the overtone following through the air.	1513.4553846262315
A third.	2919.0350544891376
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	2418.3623549076055
Could have given that address too.	2258.9943049632147
And past the sailors ’ home.	1098.3980249595852
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	1566.3266147174486
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	2093.611630697107
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	3488.7454464598563
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	1420.6675089213045
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	933.329803481779
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	7905.5371357617905
Come home to ma, da.	2264.084432272693
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	1931.0311941552181
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	2174.5484465265968
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	1486.3286134150133
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	3526.8200392522917
At eleven it is.	1661.9208983026106
Time enough.	5084.01489538101
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	1794.0977600874066
Corny.	4852.460029887852
Met her once in the park.	483.14530558705184
What a lark.	2344.551026206856
Police tout.	14745.820837099007
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	2384.548588280733
O, surely he bagged it.	1364.8034809528913
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	3579.105373629491
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	1109.3343017921284
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	1796.4074120997636
Rather warm.	5902.416758897582
Tea.	648.4142163114785
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	2573.8626144787654
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	802.2822015858941
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	1669.3062509309611
Very warm morning.	4744.002067854774
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	1649.7309592784861
Just there.	2585.050649275892
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	863.3358726761107
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	960.3871431935869
So warm.	4175.889347886148
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	1383.8031986612054
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	831.8777911717912
The far east.	2897.142621603187
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	1839.0677426484017
Wonder is it like that.	845.5610554566368
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	1658.6123510389723
Sleep six months out of twelve.	3501.747992072028
Too hot to quarrel.	4547.740638438757
Influence of the climate.	2665.0416183817356
Lethargy.	15787.963800563719
Flowers of idleness.	9068.63454490448
The air feeds most.	5276.297528405458
Azotes.	21558.06072352106
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	11468.18294284539
Sensitive plants.	14530.207353402693
Waterlilies.	21558.06072352106
Petals too tired to.	4319.346607228943
Sleeping sickness in the air.	3144.764579091968
Walk on roseleaves.	7343.883717260674
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	7847.624238329534
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	409.53746018528466
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	799.997276261627
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	1706.0768650119408
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	217.4067020162709
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	375.8535031134067
It ’ s a law something like that.	623.3391309633244
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	2937.3480150167143
The college curriculum.	6695.08141558908
Cracking curriculum.	27324.731655759035
What is weight really when you say the weight?	561.0080515650618
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	6823.233678846315
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	3316.156944480042
They all fall to the ground.	940.3192935254484
The earth.	2162.284544468452
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	301.4668730759659
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	1683.7341181703714
How did she walk with her sausages?	540.3437050044297
Like that something.	1891.2280658833936
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	1498.544913114448
Careless air: just drop in to see.	1648.2160823173342
Per second per second.	8344.958106316522
Per second for every second it means.	3150.5437136777346
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	1256.4483121140133
Too late box.	6269.186177068463
Post here.	6977.755265652362
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	3038.304346989588
— Are there any letters for me?	463.4606352371057
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	1450.9070524465517
No answer probably.	4018.5117629830934
Went too far last time.	3835.0638051547444
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	1428.1635185892942
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	1040.2250929900783
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	5646.68966622848
O.	2152.5665654701224
Westland Row, City.	2866.525528377828
Answered anyhow.	16190.153464254461
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	1046.4286195020939
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	484.86076124848637
Castoff soldier.	18763.011041933474
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	5212.336663394861
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	648.550403251653
Pointed cuffs.	31633.267610030063
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	2310.5471180783024
Redcoats.	21558.06072352106
Too showy.	16984.84587213627
That must be why the women go after them.	1127.1935825334178
Uniform.	15787.963800563719
Easier to enlist and drill.	8114.322881409549
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	1220.5739322322202
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	2441.019621057183
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	4923.343587304228
Mark time.	3701.756161131203
Table: able.	5805.861150822474
Bed: ed.	15342.753049983246
The King ’ s own.	996.8390795778316
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	1941.4734742197613
A mason, yes.	1925.8617578109834
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	581.5251737426627
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	2065.211792633929
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	1054.6066481437765
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	1156.3062643179674
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	918.0789047041925
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	2589.9208482078957
No. M ’ Coy.	4357.544401876458
Get rid of him quickly.	1921.338224512839
Take me out of my way.	927.6554368463239
Hate company when you.	3459.9397844570344
— Hello, Bloom.	760.0850078070923
Where are you off to?	253.1985282621724
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	927.5427561287603
Nowhere in particular.	5892.4423869252505
— How ’ s the body?	175.04108471932895
— Fine.	2325.0786537978065
How are you?	240.2919922679729
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	1272.083009184372
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	1962.2881286854476
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	359.81968856797073
Poor Dignam, you know.	1096.562876163635
The funeral is today.	1884.9285978656358
— To be sure, poor fellow.	976.5428244130512
So it is.	1150.3403966702226
What time?	204.60549395131252
A photo it isn ’ t.	1276.6671740142046
A badge maybe.	1099.8103173471948
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	6184.432893484882
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	620.2159451639337
Eleven, is it?	284.76194244137656
I only heard it last night.	1169.3366205625298
Who was telling me?	358.3414898082236
Holohan.	11695.605131062071
You know Hoppy?	830.2619986180557
— I know.	782.2745740389835
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	928.980521660496
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	527.2331456142384
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	579.4068681613426
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	1355.145407052247
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	1504.714184150723
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	3457.939261954491
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	2028.0209283927343
Handsome is and handsome does.	2730.5510750372177
Reserved about to yield.	6995.916094006052
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	2137.124555356547
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	1697.536078617479
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	551.2488310566251
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	1099.7911664439462
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	1912.553567179582
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	1417.4882946630619
In came Hoppy.	5516.060371933106
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	1991.4794812935193
Clearly I can see today.	3544.329310635504
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	6556.109209896563
Talking of one thing or another.	1284.4673140326813
Lady ’ s hand.	1133.1863242716277
Which side will she get up?	608.7790000746999
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	957.28670903866
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	2936.209766537581
High brown boots with laces dangling.	5459.850855568258
Wellturned foot.	14300.99111635046
What is he foostering over that change for?	579.5140854203318
Sees me looking.	5389.405391077893
Eye out for other fellow always.	2348.643221339155
Good fallback.	13928.541907666899
Two strings to her bow.	801.01493557723
— _Why? _ I said.	897.0495199810197
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	629.6635147778455
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	3741.915409419842
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	525.3689818241534
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	567.8138267497409
Getting up in a minute.	1748.5067573590309
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	885.5898423848641
He said.	1063.5548700218362
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	980.0988598897192
And, faith, he filled up.	657.909267485739
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	2748.140613242504
I said.	855.0800541154501
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	687.6303545569745
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	924.2290427904683
_Yes, _ he said.	1001.1309722763858
_He ’ s gone.	1392.450378010724
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	2279.6813859725216
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	4690.0930301482
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	12107.276045139102
Lost it.	4344.562944922733
Curse your noisy pugnose.	3369.4515135947563
Feels locked out of it.	2282.0013936861055
Paradise and the peri.	3528.9404372203503
Always happening like that.	3455.60889924925
The very moment.	1942.25478005575
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	1900.741133157698
Her friend covering the display of.	898.4670062244224
_Esprit de corps_.	31089.829950868007
Well, what are you gaping at?	338.99468066050173
Another gone.	5237.33264325522
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	504.9041887496462
The tram passed.	2719.1916170021427
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	2369.85681637079
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	1550.957633073143
— Wife well, I suppose?	302.1267117470615
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	1030.2631394205387
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	395.1330619851079
Tiptop, thanks.	3202.6247355342225
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	791.9725346912381
Incomplete.	13137.782459902772
With it an abode of bliss.	1886.0844203097242
— My missus has just got an engagement.	1139.451278295211
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	1329.4227052176925
Valise tack again.	14115.91816997284
By the way no harm.	1479.8124316308836
I ’ m off that, thanks.	589.3453352601365
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	4509.95140290336
— My wife too, he said.	595.8518454074331
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	998.1718505789573
— That so?	192.87747994220763
M ’ Coy said.	1365.2612842803906
Glad to hear that, old man.	745.0930678017633
Who ’ s getting it up?	255.79212231276534
Mrs Marion Bloom.	2668.269411917123
Not up yet.	2459.274034633595
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	1326.6437967790926
No book.	3012.3343800423268
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	7713.273364527918
Dark lady and fair man.	2161.2021205325095
Letter.	11695.605131062071
Cat furry black ball.	14818.63638186305
Torn strip of envelope.	7485.92024452251
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	7337.401409523205
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	392.4284422236877
_Sweeeet song_.	50041.95876441744
There ’ s a committee formed.	219.73313380708146
Part shares and part profits.	10063.750879089843
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	1889.2244039056156
— O, well, he said.	326.97721425055556
That ’ s good news.	1157.5622120286018
He moved to go.	1233.092696314723
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	588.8455086029894
Meet you knocking around.	6083.322933273496
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	525.3689818241534
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	700.3393419044253
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	384.2833443447542
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	616.8307107561692
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	850.1846242835545
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	371.78887052747683
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	395.0902819796304
That ’ ll be all right.	889.0722362109881
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	1338.8096781698987
Thanks, old man.	1135.7277121920777
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	951.3545453873452
Well, tolloll.	3696.242029531153
Just C.	4161.820371356269
P.	4260.019879117364
M ’ Coy will do.	1572.5928796134647
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	593.2678662851101
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	3423.3000769740033
The quick touch.	2920.315193114213
Soft mark.	6956.660063563488
I ’ d like my job.	927.2707468872217
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	1857.8637540326308
Leather.	21558.06072352106
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	9750.180770533978
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	917.3539062278962
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	840.3468604026531
My missus has just got an.	2490.7321154110473
Reedy freckled soprano.	57072.74799192729
Cheeseparing nose.	14677.290860574849
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	1050.7675225250916
No guts in it.	1200.622826665689
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	421.0801613370422
Softsoaping.	21558.06072352106
Give you the needle that would.	1326.7852012511237
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	342.6988855998438
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	785.1636043991061
Against my grain somehow.	10493.730157756936
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	3045.4608747146262
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	1711.112477025395
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	2583.0985453181215
Your wife and my wife.	1500.7971768209943
Wonder is he pimping after me?	756.2202200592177
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	646.515760705538
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	4395.120400819404
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	9863.58714950187
No, he ’ s going on straight.	521.0304330561758
Hello.	4990.896473038367
_Leah_ tonight.	1296.1850782182357
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	1433.2722153836253
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	2965.6876155655846
Male impersonator.	31362.37528359212
Perhaps he was a woman.	865.5782433285837
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	5144.411082797589
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	1742.2548746588755
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	1204.797092485056
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	1519.1112007996737
And Ristori in Vienna.	1403.0049266014203
What is this the right name is?	267.6145603007676
By Mosenthal it is.	2883.3431969757744
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	1080.9041001337778
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	473.84429127046064
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	785.219205093987
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	682.171493402796
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	1036.566141637948
No use thinking of it any more.	1339.5139973900832
Nosebag time.	9872.782612409905
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	1285.3465395225755
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	737.5198528608541
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	2009.0972119889548
Their Eldorado.	16270.68850963357
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	2771.4285960750076
Too full for words.	2497.990348132052
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	1744.0624204127134
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	2577.9791680029034
Might be happy all the same that way.	1035.0541420051352
Good poor brutes they look.	2855.345079360963
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	6218.4111395327445
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	779.3262301556462
Might just walk into her here.	2102.0519080041668
The lane is safer.	4190.233061811308
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	933.2941002831357
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	3691.9766177571396
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	1088.2664290752346
_Voglio e non_.	21794.192488561443
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	2017.123535751313
Sociable.	21558.06072352106
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	4477.31483226271
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	10127.14421170809
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	1069.1305357099068
No - one.	1753.705768886597
Meade ’ s timberyard.	4226.500204522288
Piled balks.	39616.09131016968
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	3745.601485373021
Not a sinner.	3077.7601832928094
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	2187.518047036393
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	2622.4691186382165
Pity to disturb them.	3002.9018042106604
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	1331.054939457595
Open it.	2361.728908551413
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	1127.5548405779712
She liked mignonette.	9467.8277288779
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	1888.8645434377893
And Mr?	164.38018103028512
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	1250.1909762676653
A flower.	2868.7325981426966
I think it ’ s a.	378.2202301762828
Not annoyed then?	1070.8360055430865
What does she say?	389.58597903462606
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	957.5430215874918
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	1193.6468903248747
Why did you enclose the stamps?	757.9413488515042
I am awfully angry with you.	1400.9589703350548
I do wish I could punish you for that.	834.1121009395775
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	987.7717008558014
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	517.1801330144109
I do wish I could do something for you.	846.9686387003707
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	1070.4298383053106
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	735.2744439191812
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	629.322143749987
I think of you so often you have no idea.	793.474271700747
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	854.5102889007537
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	1191.834419742158
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	1123.6286778990755
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	610.957102255681
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	2513.881481776724
Then I will tell you all.	947.4309909666921
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	1291.1313754489781
today.	4182.093624832532
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	5642.556098950398
S.	3386.8216662258314
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	1798.3698014872534
I want to know.	841.5598442466151
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	1721.4763130292874
They like it because no - one can hear.	1201.9980974572993
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	2139.05167645933
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	944.5192974410485
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	4147.526094681872
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	442.66576936752716
Weak joy opened his lips.	4841.223221861007
Changed since the first letter.	3220.6770916142973
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	2033.3973228424427
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	1121.692531168718
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	2341.3538774571525
Thank you: not having any.	1331.381568523545
Usual love scrimmage.	18665.944823589398
Then running round corners.	3995.6540820537566
Bad as a row with Molly.	1439.1216226954302
Cigar has a cooling effect.	6891.213058862341
Narcotic.	21558.06072352106
Go further next time.	4455.592925752945
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	1113.0699870937055
Brutal, why not?	621.9033921649301
A bit at a time.	847.4974270178914
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	826.2536182743673
Common pin, eh?	1187.9624673735632
He threw it on the road.	796.1246870046687
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	1843.6370375872123
Queer the number of pins they always have.	1206.9773441475468
No roses without thorns.	7304.518985674317
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	3889.474890270746
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	595.1327959387321
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	1166.3641972530393
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	712.4852437543145
It?	142.1440528873847
Them.	13137.782459902772
Such a bad headache.	4108.330999530137
Has her roses probably.	3897.1666723931066
Or sitting all day typing.	5212.834531417943
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	7369.245757273348
What perfume does your wife use.	2914.590668518466
Now could you make out a thing like that?	365.53214219630786
To keep it up.	1499.0164009593593
Martha, Mary.	1807.3905825920997
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	1735.305696570619
He is sitting in their house, talking.	749.9424115849008
Mysterious.	15787.963800563719
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	696.1730861546552
To keep it up.	1499.0164009593593
Nice kind of evening feeling.	2696.59609439978
No more wandering about.	2411.8467564210673
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	2443.027419618766
Forget.	11695.605131062071
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	2103.2841118421825
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	460.6555264018524
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	2001.3718461133583
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	2813.8973513256874
Tell her: more and more: all.	626.1153584241586
Then a sigh: silence.	1593.1316433833701
Long long long rest.	3512.370218102969
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	1236.907344723835
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	1434.5562657050198
Henry Flower.	5163.759129524553
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	908.7807844451845
Simple bit of paper.	3357.471358997428
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	2481.4017543181667
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	954.3703342986161
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	1302.8885769132983
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	19138.31111603294
A million pounds, wait a moment.	1378.897249600363
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	887.9085004484247
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	1628.81554968792
Yes, exactly.	1458.2367092607112
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	2164.6909221929996
What am I saying barrels?	603.6528549757313
Gallons.	21558.06072352106
About a million barrels all the same.	1453.139353395774
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	4980.067606276982
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	4732.112960191936
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	2692.196688220094
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	2276.497656502259
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	606.3017167248046
Damn it.	2341.628543456053
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	973.0630536478276
Same notice on the door.	1521.4519077471496

Save China ’ s millions.	883.4464045887389
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	2487.2450710639473
Prefer an ounce of opium.	9817.32697264587
Celestials.	21558.06072352106
Rank heresy for them.	9208.9186888627
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	1628.532240814094
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	1552.4143310130705
Not like Ecce Homo.	14457.72926991437
Crown of thorns and cross.	2658.134880488309
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	4555.106732789888
Chopsticks?	1160.373267622947
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	2267.4157130540816
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	1382.5326572097179
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	586.075025417597
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	1638.792517635551
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	1377.103870791424
Still life.	3358.4718979394806
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	1197.9729293899873
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	1825.4153101624993
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	1023.8573536218393
Something going on: some sodality.	2538.1682187674833
Pity so empty.	4220.522549559481
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	2715.7626875370647
Who is my neighbour?	444.3443648398942
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	1937.5273838758649
That woman at midnight mass.	2648.859415381691
Seventh heaven.	11166.96736719069
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	3080.6404122577146
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	1146.708799482729
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	654.0711141084232
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	620.6732543589105
Her hat and head sank.	1939.1350712856552
Then the next one.	1138.2800731659345
Her hat sank at once.	2668.576134993759
Then the next one: a small old woman.	851.362938627275
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	714.0558066329666
Latin.	5798.655857615648
The next one.	1634.2174744893796
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	1549.6391188910554
What?	122.71942533465327
_Corpus: _ body.	2598.402035794549
Corpse.	13137.782459902772
Good idea the Latin.	2142.7838529398105
Stupefies them first.	5912.607564936798
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	1334.3087796583777
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	2767.5287998167623
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	2311.5533389351967
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	1011.866448877681
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	1064.096686666143
These pots we have to wear.	1032.5732274278039
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	2789.699759741143
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	1020.2625610995701
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	2022.9703875165476
Look at them.	1728.7615149290693
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	2114.1466458093055
Lollipop.	21558.06072352106
It does.	2788.0327690886625
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	661.4854323933002
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	664.7136930674225
Hokypoky penny a lump.	6220.730641977118
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	652.7683162584791
They do.	2119.833664387063
I ’ m sure of that.	534.2970490873898
Not so lonely.	3243.504858244279
In our confraternity.	6004.871936193024
Then come out a bit spreeish.	2610.837264114902
Let off steam.	3759.2921718894813
Thing is if you really believe in it.	1401.2251203260842
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	662.5911601256569
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	4811.018856083041
Hence those snores.	17518.46857954405
Blind faith.	11996.458354698461
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	1037.6302305099262
Lulls all pain.	8076.760575085133
Wake this time next year.	4523.107262171917
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	956.2301438908294
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	771.1726111888556
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	604.4152448688337
Bald spot behind.	5398.009820492555
Letters on his back: <URL>	531.7329491503414
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	513.6447897318345
And the other one?	168.03026298003581
Iron nails ran in.	4996.807256299115
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	3024.234376252353
Do not deny my request.	3946.462283262883
Dusk and the light behind her.	1289.4453043010287
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	493.19279304414334
Their character.	5587.368986387171
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	396.3485988925727
This very church.	3694.7211524093664
Peter Carey, yes.	689.5687851332968
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	1446.8793510433636
Denis Carey.	1320.857985428075
And just imagine that.	1694.2282060385032
Wife and six children at home.	2024.4542631003062
And plotting that murder all the time.	1602.3108632995963
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	779.4896987543127
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	1507.360665546432
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	304.6154216319322
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	360.91703078432903
Yes: under the bridge.	976.389580027217
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	1635.458998951896
Wine.	5659.915422629268
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	1324.426551793985
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	969.3109229205864
Cold comfort.	6831.747672864215
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	2518.7861169281923
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	881.6037824793223
Quite right.	4064.25508981383
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	1276.9201942108639
Not going to be any music.	1446.7791455852928
Pity.	5846.311267724853
Who has the organ here I wonder?	497.0317728476658
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	1381.644269057572
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	1421.291335135845
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	3706.3192266551873
Christ or Pilate?	1015.1530936060678
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	835.8557139591126
Music they wanted.	3337.120913242295
Footdrill stopped.	16888.321215332682
Could hear a pin drop.	3178.084691120517
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	1195.1040724469733
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	872.3841974086232
Mercadante: seven last words.	3700.7057291768315
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	2425.8199838080536
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	1457.070599409351
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	1906.2608478406337
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	1877.1050674145351
Benedictine.	21558.06072352106
Green Chartreuse.	17720.413549698675
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	1127.5313805038081
What kind of voice is it?	260.4450652334781
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	2892.7438289171487
Connoisseurs.	21558.06072352106
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	1690.330317705864
Kind of a placid.	2205.885547857308
No worry.	8495.30049534365
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	219.87038360805377
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	2185.953604036706
Who knows?	393.59294241244436
One way out of it.	784.7888668085708
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	731.0255653772155
All crossed themselves and stood up.	1810.2470707076222
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	974.5319422022343
Stand up at the gospel of course.	950.3631334628452
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	1082.0098403926856
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	587.8847104292447
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	1532.820112300661
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	870.2839262226963
English.	5225.663890838169
Throw them the bone.	2527.7612872625105
I remember slightly.	2495.7025694904837
How long since your last mass?	949.1930186095364

Punish me, please.	2894.197965565497
Great weapon in their hands.	2030.7896610708087
More than doctor or solicitor.	3972.481194253172

No browbeating him.	4963.415607382989
He had his answer pat for everything.	1974.863404015089
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	667.2981700751171
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	1466.0447168797461
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	981.7388563977293
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	1096.221806635749
All over.	2201.556770414652
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	3100.9560032432896
Brother Buzz.	11774.470454882252
Come around with the plate perhaps.	1654.799191610366
Pay your Easter duty.	1761.5860052500118
He stood up.	1468.2975372887754
Hello.	4990.896473038367
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	606.1814767374406
Women enjoy it.	3237.495000072782
Never tell you.	2186.626174210816
But we.	2192.037458271606
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	828.4888968670352
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	4232.429441344627
Glimpses of the moon.	2041.286966130462
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	1876.7271402226133
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	1097.7103264946027
Still like you better untidy.	3190.1643576969186
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	2140.6252575315393
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	1056.7706048930245
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	1600.5992528530453
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	1183.103348963345
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	2007.6920102071424
He covered himself.	2365.2149360544577
How goes the time?	307.51395717470416
Quarter past.	9177.23396261098
Time enough yet.	4976.654756389761
Better get that lotion made up.	1957.5646391058547
Ah yes, the last time.	788.2189008427796
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	2221.5104912308434

He walked southward along Westland row.	5398.236827861293
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	842.6306115336779
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	857.5202602325703
Bore this funeral affair.	8378.25103650897
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	485.79345367799465
When was it I got it made up last?	372.1641260255545
Wait.	4301.167531310137
I changed a sovereign I remember.	1285.495210692258
First of the month it must have been or the second.	725.4916404850876
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	750.8107840840063

— About a fortnight ago, sir?	438.20444139476444
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	525.3689818241534
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	1112.021905949159
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	1303.311430111392
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	3123.7784651674538
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	2338.576540605837
— And white wax also, he said.	808.0263445650717
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	405.9806706688327

Do it in the bath.	781.8273438255665
Curious longing I.	4702.874183098939
Water to water.	3384.7197273629927
Combine business with pleasure.	6574.46303168072
Pity no time for massage.	4055.1299096249854
Feel fresh then all the day.	1369.1578319606938
Funeral be rather glum.	10394.245331870366
That was two and nine.	1011.5215582577235
Have you brought a bottle?	487.44403061237443
— No, Mr Bloom said.	509.82360409885626
Make it up, please.	1103.8897590781623
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	682.9648132368933
— Fourpence, sir.	1924.046438669463
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	1072.1887724279336
Sweet lemony wax.	17028.601114842848
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	417.6999261322656
That makes three and a penny.	1294.6511297667555
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	541.394269430807
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	806.5352197973165
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	580.8340332806438
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	579.1330668133247
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	568.7476674733366
What ’ s the best news?	256.90614132446257
Is that today ’ s?	249.81198361815592
Show us a minute.	2362.201327433643
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	1670.3170751583816
He does look balmy.	3813.5744863185355
Younger than I am.	4117.003124495729
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	3953.112801553704
Wants a wash too.	725.3830714902608
Take off the rough dirt.	961.1165174616584
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	825.7511378246393
Dandruff on his shoulders.	3427.9058622833686
Scalp wants oiling.	33243.28995431523
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	765.6320492650879
Where the bugger is it?	263.1511072831898
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	2506.2758538832904
Barber ’ s itch.	4938.814093590452
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	1557.3630035761144
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	835.4296912644919
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	608.5905111274776
— Ascot.	3911.0486764800676
Gold cup.	5733.215672230976
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	1180.1827267998017
Half a mo.	4325.553719423452
Maximum the second.	3268.8489884942405
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	503.96348022760304
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	5047.019323461977
— What ’ s that?	121.33936717810553
his sharp voice said.	1513.1476524800355
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	622.8159067662527
I was going to throw it away that moment.	754.4901037443797
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	1862.3049045566609
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	486.41489877529165
Here, thanks.	1723.3166555766543
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	2597.0762011379197
God speed scut.	14140.09096043747
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	732.2578713358072
Silly lips of that chap.	1581.8877093733224
Betting.	15787.963800563719
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	4882.03848194968
Raffle for large tender turkey.	10273.03790559543
Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	672.3737336607975
Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	7003.9179420701275
Keeps a hotel now.	3435.7183810338993
They never come back.	1961.988859382821
Fleshpots of Egypt.	5455.897886899785
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	2421.2334206039827
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	1220.8810962595103
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	1568.5391520330843
Damn bad ad.	5718.632211262829
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	1044.221144204257
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	1158.7429356347313
Something to catch the eye.	1311.3662299104285
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	535.6382007215441
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	729.3276665990842
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	177.8889491146792
How do you do, sir?	277.3912099150704
Heavenly weather really.	14730.260660011727
If life was always like that.	1102.525050035869
Cricket weather.	18175.262019302758
Sit around under sunshades.	7802.759954296253
Over after over.	2670.508914049996
Out.	5225.663890838169
They can ’ t play it here.	1082.4667661238234
Duck for six wickets.	13834.552510784053
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	2333.779511274575
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	2608.171831136673
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	1031.3368797568203
Heatwave.	21558.06072352106
Won ’ t last.	1576.188947550412
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	586.6753704400936
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	1691.7537453653326
This is my body.	1839.238585159929
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	933.7226072049772
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	1098.9531748889315
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	1248.4628188569702
— Come on, Simon.	769.6789344586205
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	539.0347386703681
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	693.1145895418088
— Are we all here now?	412.8059188433367
Martin Cunningham asked.	3209.565978294886
Come along, Bloom.	1078.296888876125
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	982.9725880672536
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	1197.937994095049
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	738.5780511706545
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	3817.0995058741487
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	2183.9588083821254
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	1666.6902459596397
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	1823.5349891608519
Job seems to suit them.	4361.299694585892
Huggermugger in corners.	6163.1943056672935
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	2455.488638023257
Then getting it ready.	2540.366152207811
Laying it out.	3608.9679085889006
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	1504.0012589426492
Pull it more to your side.	1622.2783307413445
Our windingsheet.	10341.882410081687
Never know who will touch you dead.	1975.6732110013218
Wash and shampoo.	12701.947107324491
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	416.30630778040796
Keep a bit in an envelope.	1330.8281931114366
Grows all the same after.	2036.5674137555627
Unclean job.	15672.751670321535
All waited.	4184.849589735888
Nothing was said.	1533.2628777915022
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	1156.427767576126
I am sitting on something hard.	1605.2396176532227
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	935.2510861843197
Better shift it out of that.	917.5130835685453
Wait for an opportunity.	2189.772996361715
All waited.	4184.849589735888
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	1175.378957357672
A jolt.	6729.382459240637
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	1808.7819331675407
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	4329.87005971622
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	1297.0408798247818
At walking pace.	5255.724382997116
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	1493.8949085611437
Tritonville road.	10584.995542861658
Quicker.	15787.963800563719
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	1949.6769557787197
— What way is he taking us?	348.13606582854015
Mr Power asked through both windows.	2677.2593264403354
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	1088.2958997716544
Ringsend.	5659.915422629268
Brunswick street.	752.9413293398924
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	1194.8809692886978
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	470.7618745906594
I am glad to see it has not died out.	958.7235694230575
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	3445.1961111472783
Respect.	13137.782459902772
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	3658.4453172087283
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	1149.720625805163
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	403.6117918812555
— Who is that?	175.22034705802525
— Your son and heir.	1641.5205638756288
— Where is he?	176.07995606084225
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	1641.9908545457783
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	2214.8225411132366
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	596.2700224630574
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	1437.7183249632778
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	856.5319687836213
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	3799.3182010287496
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	8731.564117613036
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	1837.6842337396574
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	1142.5882886883853
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	2849.236450592014
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	1420.0358685619733
Out on the rampage all night.	1913.6594996429046
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	793.0493186911326
Wife ironing his back.	3803.1970999576415
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	1974.7886978574475
All breadcrumbs they are.	4217.175604729726
About six hundred per cent profit.	3190.222359069223
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	932.7229157646093
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	4018.174390879065
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	661.8404373019289
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	547.6913203655971
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	913.6863612267128
A counterjumper ’ s son.	2074.6888473066438
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	2625.516076941332
Not likely.	4900.541162250193
He ceased.	2701.210910467856
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	892.6127924966772
Noisy selfwilled man.	18189.616150302652
Full of his son.	1200.7390448841707
He is right.	1124.8875528015546
Something to hand on.	1133.4345858512058
If little Rudy had lived.	3152.477558692545
See him grow up.	2157.688466659694
Hear his voice in the house.	796.5556712506576
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	4274.815177937745
My son.	3409.0372427785564
Me in his eyes.	1059.7231257727005
Strange feeling it would be.	1930.4499117479006
From me.	2239.2519401929235
Just a chance.	2186.7936706266346
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	846.9992392570017
And the sergeant grinning up.	1983.003263989359
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	1559.085310676585
Give us a touch, Poldy.	1342.5244476243827
God, I ’ m dying for it.	544.0626113046504
How life begins.	3790.51576909814
Got big then.	3193.6214530089846
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	4572.821861787943
My son inside her.	2415.9594978966575
I could have helped him on in life.	766.7758153679808
I could.	1203.4531266792083
Make him independent.	3496.051012577531
Learn German too.	10557.439822753948
— Are we late?	493.58738551238866
Mr Power asked.	2273.159303446849
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	895.542521277957
Molly.	4058.063193947426
Milly.	4726.769801346335
Same thing watered down.	7223.876109832468
Her tomboy oaths.	16489.08682240566
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	1356.8256222368664
Soon be a woman.	2123.8038999218393
Mullingar.	5827.72223398114
Dearest Papli.	2861.236469091757
Young student.	6556.61759758003
Yes, yes: a woman too.	617.336960363813
Life, life.	1490.4461623456436
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	2344.7129151218237
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	973.2430274816176
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	762.0980581855567
Do you follow me?	437.0797588420887
He closed his left eye.	1577.1897630857236
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	2655.2698686642384
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	141.35671202578317
Crumbs?	849.7949504514035
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	1344.270477392132
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	2825.2462856123816
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	990.9791480700075
What do you think, Martin?	292.14885323734734
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	955.6460421606475
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	1465.1701396007174
Glad I took that bath.	1852.6715390924958
Feel my feet quite clean.	3801.234752418908
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	3543.3844712006394
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	5395.052845165085
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	313.5724929345369
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	792.9990306491349
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	1185.0456538578903
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	741.1863321086165
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	843.1276575704665
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	561.5678485555385
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	861.7974326436428
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	706.1196952322981
He said he ’ d try to come.	698.492790823221
The carriage halted short.	3472.2656527748118
— What ’ s wrong?	211.5353910925543
— We ’ re stopped.	1353.7474327400578
— Where are we?	302.2956870852211
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	571.5057677972304
— The grand canal, he said.	727.1753214492749
Whooping cough they say it cures.	5962.025459757104
Good job Milly never got it.	2438.9012923316213
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	2408.929267995448
Shame really.	10041.518260523597
Only measles.	16523.415154956747
Flaxseed tea.	14779.23997012395
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	17908.741890247937
Canvassing for death.	5954.023715070668
Don ’ t miss this chance.	1883.9339079239912
Dogs ’ home over there.	2061.52235461753
Thy will be done.	894.0270752272384
We obey them in the grave.	1479.0356458542963
A dying scrawl.	6955.634175567702
He took it to heart, pined away.	1129.9476725055877
Quiet brute.	12975.8599347642
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	1825.8069819898078
A raindrop spat on his hat.	3449.4015922995395
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	2699.0999893506037
Apart.	21558.06072352106
Curious.	5828.641383569536
Like through a colander.	4052.4825779219855
I thought it would.	964.0033335410054
My boots were creaking I remember now.	2155.799289002704
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	1016.9690047445733
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	969.9478601827616
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	660.169508454795
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	740.1349115636402
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	1411.087711683066
— We ’ re off again.	1040.980207277313
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	3783.2077287931434
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	943.856003886063
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	1245.3799147636319
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	584.723046982007
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	1395.1167017259354
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	3103.791309518315
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	1003.5568898546521
And the retrospective arrangement.	1829.8976589103604
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	672.8673745345901
Martin Cunningham asked.	3209.565978294886
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	503.9353782187132
Where is it?	193.84544530896218
— In the paper this morning.	961.1050094832821
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	991.8952453244498
That book I must change for her.	1161.6885344912557
Later on please.	5480.476846253456
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	624.7200322496136
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	456.9788578290354
no, Sexton, Urbright.	2639.4202782799916
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	7713.316304031533
Thanks to the Little Flower.	1637.7774417441874
Sadly missed.	11774.470454882252
To the inexpressible grief of his.	1529.0325674881385
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	4214.649441728866
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	3671.594772038988
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	4489.73744220054
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	1865.5284229868003
I tore up the envelope?	328.0353532535421
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	398.6255561273593
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	5587.528516374067
There all right.	1704.346392928311
Dear Henry fled.	11412.111312965097
Before my patience are exhausted.	5035.852563251664
National school.	6296.818939289091
Meade ’ s yard.	2534.699395021143
The hazard.	5102.218821642528
Only two there now.	1984.274230405138
Nodding.	21558.06072352106
Full as a tick.	3639.0481213494204
Too much bone in their skulls.	2493.7124910502935
The other trotting round with a fare.	1636.836199632124
An hour ago I was passing there.	1730.3631710525242
The jarvies raised their hats.	4019.780392673985
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	2240.951870126278
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	826.2961399868957
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	673.4993370660708
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	843.2087127797676
Antient concert rooms.	14028.271904220765
Nothing on there.	1763.2222283710378
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	2458.4500672385707
Not much grief there.	2898.6732168096933
Quarter mourning.	12145.845923108172
People in law perhaps.	2658.1022574765016
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	950.3144289955941
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	1340.2044139474347
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	638.5269992975869
I said I.	573.6922062297544
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	1090.4927508503868
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	33946.21266815604
Big powerful change.	6547.33164380232
Wet bright bills for next week.	4259.852682285562
_Fun on the Bristol_.	5507.524956282091
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	1335.8810992970612
Have to stand a drink or two.	1273.741417843833
As broad as it ’ s long.	943.2138236735564
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	521.8922571549352
Her songs.	4977.25485481193
Plasto ’ s.	1875.1913393032557
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	8583.245590178773
Who was he?	160.19267156745246
— How do you do?	283.74401035151305
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	1015.716203367347
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	660.6014585206997
Yes, he does.	777.7003301978286
How do you do?	316.88159898952773
— Who?	168.13827833536334
Mr Dedalus asked.	1913.7267970502212
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	998.120943068429
There he is airing his quiff.	3356.556996455992
Just that moment I was thinking.	1216.8381306411086
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	2130.370621888645
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	1192.9110674921453
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	692.9804668179571
The nails, yes.	1158.4913756788624
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	467.3958934355077
Fascination.	21558.06072352106
Worst man in Dublin.	2519.7653153058423
That keeps him alive.	2865.0646820386783
They sometimes feel what a person is.	1477.1897140559684
Instinct.	13137.782459902772
But a type like that.	1015.5407586349512
My nails.	4752.1847447735145
I am just looking at them: well pared.	1613.312315699435
And after: thinking alone.	1722.4203097947748
Body getting a bit softy.	5968.8759076324095
I would notice that: from remembering.	501.66867208522007
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	1423.8521257765356
But the shape is there.	966.129047800563
The shape is there still.	1498.8493374188927
Shoulders.	21558.06072352106
Hips.	21558.06072352106
Plump.	21558.06072352106
Night of the dance dressing.	1599.7593554904386
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	4348.56771598627
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	1053.698937197115
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	455.50109326103893
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	447.77097183534556
I hear great accounts of it.	1337.0238522118552
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	1555.6758626635924
— Are you going yourself?	465.83354718457906
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	590.8781934919838
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	1059.2812878165394
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	1431.7031692881949
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	666.0672647639763
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	1025.6724938206794
Mary Anderson is up there now.	2175.3688208773856
Have you good artists?	1001.7275945105253
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	1625.320163411675
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	1167.8667869112808
J.	2953.906025021904
C.	3903.316026160732
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	1944.308392486318
The best, in fact.	749.5666552089361
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	1426.9344427649157
Last but not least.	2672.4880622690926
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	1406.842050322502
Smith O ’ Brien.	2175.671765281925
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	1708.5735829877067
Woman.	5493.011093616205
Must be his deathday.	3549.511599416657
For many happy returns.	5239.350400320623
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	1658.7977419703727
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	2520.4478630981907
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	1364.8269917561438
Had his office in Hume street.	2904.899783529249
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	1817.8397756640059
Has that silk hat ever since.	2789.621968970053
Relics of old decency.	6034.714902901051
Mourning too.	7537.70349050344
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	3118.202334539609
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	1578.4642420345547
Twenty past eleven.	5392.794681085864
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	2884.3744453024915
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	2659.2089866428514
No: _vorrei e non_.	8078.91296298074
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	1132.069066247392
_Mi trema un poco il_.	64318.46070666275
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	2437.611026575072
A thrush.	5863.030725352058
A throstle.	5863.030725352058
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	1872.3169263485518
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	1498.2703734505208
Greyish over the ears.	3405.033409284933
_Madame_: smiling.	5267.369342437501
I smiled back.	1620.7031513467052
A smile goes a long way.	1576.856081888149
Only politeness perhaps.	8853.188633394557
Nice fellow.	4378.444720724528
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	489.48941373822584
Not pleasant for the wife.	1295.6028224649795
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	753.7454919043041
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	2049.312409408896
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	1105.5360481441178
What is this she was?	224.7473702054832
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	2931.520954794893
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	2674.7175097127515
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	5937.373989910892
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	547.4326674049297
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	1188.7459533678857
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	1152.899015717479
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	1073.8228009492148
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	1217.258871435784
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	887.4535775177479
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	828.1492805326691
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	982.1092773958098
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	629.1749246003699
— Yes.	1408.8980448614918
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	477.2716712664332
— What is that?	146.2561916863005
Mr Dedalus asked.	1913.7267970502212
I didn ’ t hear it.	790.0253836677625
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	854.8775671032563
— What?	128.22159737738772
Mr Dedalus asked.	1913.7267970502212
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	1479.09277391475
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	2959.103064614248
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	4018.5923976218446
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	1190.7087246087956
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	2773.04051679487
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	914.0689735880696
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	1045.5390619772654
Is he dead?	316.14613270883245
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	2018.735701384738
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	610.1570145566807
Half the town was there.	1203.8310762459255
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	525.3689818241534
But the funny part is.....	15035.402996324505
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	583.8909797056964
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	1620.9700358944617
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	366.9526779848186
Like a hero.	2226.671331316685
A silver florin.	3679.454634504667
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	418.4968832998049
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	1545.5529488493778
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	1212.0369307538633
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	802.463739140085
Nelson ’ s pillar.	1678.7050653911579
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	910.9889008697857
Mr Dedalus sighed.	2806.3755776508597
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	988.741961246759
Many a good one he told himself.	1153.6746199458403
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	941.861193521511
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	717.6328016050779
He ’ s gone from us.	732.7313176044486
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	811.9688999255436
He went very suddenly.	2149.4558963393915
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	1598.878860752087
Heart.	5721.917308714802
He tapped his chest sadly.	1036.0795125673549
Blazing face: redhot.	8077.490520053059
Too much John Barleycorn.	8171.9066450705195
Cure for a red nose.	2905.9310052069713
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	2958.9398927009793
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	946.6293850625564
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	3046.2689456578137
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	498.5455148640796
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	652.3487157581892
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	2057.64039765416
— No suffering, he said.	638.331952512127
A moment and all is over.	744.3204625796071
Like dying in sleep.	2579.6268302568865
No - one spoke.	2201.2011971037045
Dead side of the street this.	947.9345178561307
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	1069.5833887247247
Why?	190.44911106412906
Some reason.	5644.571240027528
Sun or wind.	5305.971972838692
At night too.	2449.2374273570363
Chummies and slaveys.	10536.591879765758
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	2586.910536844675
Foundation stone for Parnell.	7164.537447232933
Breakdown.	15787.963800563719
Heart.	5721.917308714802
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	1376.562631080266
A tiny coffin flashed by.	4090.36772864889
In a hurry to bury.	1464.4530908006477
A mourning coach.	3950.1823858134653
Unmarried.	21558.06072352106
Black for the married.	1307.1314628395432
Piebald for bachelors.	11398.532942774682
Dun for a nun.	2603.697439831608
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	1098.2242151763292
A child.	2528.3899618973355
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	551.1220699281939

Meant nothing.	13890.002329327957
Mistake of nature.	3427.8598844441026
If it ’ s healthy it ’ s from the mother.	537.3592846684134
If not from the man.	768.6448493624097
Better luck next time.	3985.041139642032
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	840.5840625167234
It ’ s well out of it.	461.32497497102963
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	1319.961900563534
Rattle his bones.	5322.126144976672
Over the stones.	2152.744547546782
Only a pauper.	655.813934488171
Nobody owns.	2492.876193676141
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	773.5550925910082
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	453.0797572757868
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	996.7929848213182
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	889.8231830418322
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	1982.9883651028886
We must take a charitable view of it.	1694.5390007598762
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	695.2834501414947
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	687.3401257269711
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	630.0058321413695
Looking away now.	3163.56662423382
Sympathetic human man he is.	2424.501316311931
Intelligent.	21558.06072352106
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	1331.3836780676932
Always a good word to say.	1190.1095526931945
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	1690.4347443710408
Refuse christian burial.	4571.659755797967
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	1034.5014751966842
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	5501.8048628354045
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	5342.875388405136
He looked at me.	1055.4566050915605
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	903.875359748109
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	1196.0979932124235
Leading him the life of the damned.	927.2036736288237
Monday morning.	4735.490757279134
Start afresh.	39616.09131016968
Shoulder to the wheel.	2466.902243809331
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	645.6196718797528
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	1417.080329278534
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	550.3397319283263
He looked away from me.	1173.9580183078535
He knows.	2102.965636188303
Rattle his bones.	5322.126144976672
That afternoon of the inquest.	2040.1767935526348
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	2189.062367249425
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	1232.7871057089822
Stuffy it was.	3040.330490058399
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	3619.379785231215
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	1911.6159111919364
Boots giving evidence.	15676.373668015
Thought he was asleep first.	1808.3771400565415
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	2074.6982530688324
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	743.2224084565875
Verdict: overdose.	12727.208343237742
Death by misadventure.	1626.6623098724608
The letter.	2107.52818206121
For my son Leopold.	2559.5423456925932
No more pain.	3090.0033422389424
Wake no more.	4611.591680437775
Nobody owns.	2492.876193676141
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	6025.322504334444
Over the stones.	2152.744547546782
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	611.5628691477386
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	740.2849273727765
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	1876.9199875650504
The Gordon Bennett.	3663.635020649956
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	308.02492089817684
That will be worth seeing, faith.	1684.429263054129
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	2259.757259086431
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	1535.8977112846678
Kay ee double ell wy.	31688.97647269672
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	737.9598646223914
He left me on my ownio.	1901.3334767877718
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	13917.84622376244
Eccles street.	3893.742625080903
My house down there.	1834.780979560781
Big place.	4515.113395685532
Ward for incurables there.	4737.623895966269
Deadhouse handy underneath.	7020.411559718186
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	3384.8716049399736
They look terrible the women.	1714.6120581216194
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	1680.9446703932815
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	877.0901086875118
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	1762.616077354385
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	664.5903765748974
From one extreme to the other.	987.3576431129926
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	2449.234747082673
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	1849.3470340086524
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	4323.150742709111
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	1448.4770773673083
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	2119.564464584523
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	681.9792651700443
Tomorrow is killing day.	7182.006514972785
Springers.	21558.06072352106
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	6317.127456555733
For Liverpool probably.	5402.00333152012
Roastbeef for old England.	4961.722877490855
They buy up all the juicy ones.	2043.3796279098076
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	925.7833687640664
Comes to a big thing in a year.	962.5142040464856
Dead meat trade.	7259.435112806823
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	3143.7897113126814
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	3945.152447573128
The carriage moved on through the drove.	1351.3275878039506
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	624.4562307606841
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	1025.5994958048325
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	1465.5678340612221
Quite right.	4064.25508981383
They ought to.	1527.1856772433387
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	998.8277449953389
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	352.7528241480356
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	466.3394591155374
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	13448.27212599604
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	1500.710019090229
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	762.8972972524521
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	671.1829105481359
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	519.9069061503367
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	824.0925158607263
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	635.0245944767008
Gordon Bennett cup.	6752.180833414434
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	2081.756719702504
Bom! Upset.	16895.666869458062
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	939.0620600342723
Burst open.	10533.309502421813
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	1116.0609119888818
Red face: grey now.	2004.452333854477
Mouth fallen open.	5916.397736262905
Asking what ’ s up now.	1339.5315711409382
Quite right to close it.	1601.9083232237733
Looks horrid open.	8985.258566748773
Then the insides decompose quickly.	1783.1020074334729
Much better to close up all the orifices.	2638.5022619706106
Yes, also.	1210.515413138095
With wax.	4546.546823147419
The sphincter loose.	7536.387300666854
Seal up all.	3469.8084786366276
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	949.6478007992562
Dunphy ’ s corner.	2079.200229300668
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	5212.662192842493
A pause by the wayside.	3266.910036225379
Tiptop position for a pub.	2951.1629061730637
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	1102.3756819414375
Pass round the consolation.	2966.1094158104934
But suppose now it did happen.	1821.8804748794428
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	790.4141806477579
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	439.67110619410994
Depends on where.	4021.7376987138778
The circulation stops.	3674.6426150542866
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	3837.961496913242
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	892.1574404640647
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	5170.826240955345
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	815.9672520440164
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	3484.929585734436
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	8446.65516526013
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	2071.5472421336276
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	2430.378751291039
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	1697.1175421907617
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	4004.7867842645023
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	1140.9267295531556
Or cycle down.	5982.236085992985
Hire some old crock, safety.	2312.896387987563
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	707.2713181583105
Developing waterways.	39616.09131016968
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	2253.4018872229462
Cheaper transit.	31633.267610030063
By easy stages.	12568.337376877336
Houseboats.	21558.06072352106
Camping out.	7900.857544688561
Also hearses.	14028.498055875476
To heaven by water.	2377.8241348230436
Perhaps I will without writing.	2454.4194558670806
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	1948.7637994243942
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	3450.2771779381983
With turf from the midland bogs.	5282.778893124583
Salute.	13137.782459902772
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	2298.878603527047
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	4914.9674003637465
Near it now.	1933.934518822438
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	1256.5935683752837
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	1351.2805913021268
— How is that?	175.60486195844956
Martin Cunningham said.	2232.9206301861036
Left him weeping, I suppose?	585.4640062986632
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	759.5491363748507
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	4880.836604551243
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	995.7153304593008
Last lap.	6813.928077977351
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	1486.0749204019628
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	5825.370099650417
In white silence: appealing.	3387.402007478034
The best obtainable.	5278.611340742602
Thos.	21558.06072352106
H.	5065.386603875897
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	11991.755717047705
Passed.	21558.06072352106
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	1425.9326977885219
After life ’ s journey.	2059.377358111608
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	1204.120721172866
Mr Power pointed.	3304.1161997699537
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	707.5018419386828
The last house.	1806.596955434298
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	526.8471228745603
A gruesome case.	5363.600785905415
Seymour Bushe got him off.	2731.066930062844
Murdered his brother.	5608.579655822704
Or so they said.	1332.7916086592222
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	900.9858351732486
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	2561.1493723105264
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	573.9695359127377
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	2143.6247563167512
They looked.	2807.9977617651753
Murderer ’ s ground.	2351.181573497297
It passed darkly.	6069.623954191675
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	7954.127724796946
Whole place gone to hell.	3701.596680776019
Wrongfully condemned.	31633.267610030063
Murder.	11695.605131062071
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	330.0331928841035
They love reading about it.	1699.415011579718
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	957.5813426938363
Her clothing consisted of.	4301.250628995165
Recent outrage.	3614.235343929083
Murderer is still at large.	3001.176176338652
Clues.	21558.06072352106
A shoelace.	8500.371147137086
The body to be exhumed.	2318.509223750937
Murder will out.	3700.9985750861097
Cramped in this carriage.	4147.51410479616
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	1030.5291857747804
Must be careful about women.	2575.9184034679492
Catch them once with their pants down.	2984.785324396119
Never forgive you after.	2483.5146024527585
Fifteen.	5659.915422629268
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	4431.466243660976
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	4524.402136876852
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	1610.806502201614
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	4186.121311825858
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	912.4271436481898
He stepped out.	1808.36949253295
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	1318.6482403261916
Change that soap now.	3757.328435017527
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	1271.1702425562478
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	1000.7214674743876
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	3876.7850987719835
It ’ s all the same.	484.8055299353517
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	3911.665042129801
Pomp of death.	4417.777922980484
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	1443.0984042410332
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	1621.950544516703
Dogbiscuits.	21558.06072352106
Who ate them?	486.378979473032
Mourners coming out.	5313.486856771778
He followed his companions.	601.7361987841435
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	1485.6732598523959
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	943.2730993630013
He handed one to the boy.	781.4988735465424
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	424.07411949239537
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	3921.6290898747
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	3224.103912297987
Coffin now.	9744.094144702127
Got here before us, dead as he is.	885.0758697645451
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	2606.2438266864465
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	2069.56080243576
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	746.7630207269482
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	6006.083716516287
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	1162.6927786191948
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	2962.224106768276
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	5958.7740146889655
Too many in the world.	1132.7446752336446
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	1091.178558576577
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	1462.742879825746
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	483.6781031270319
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	1432.8063363907427
So much dead weight.	3821.3351141554335
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	3847.473824591442
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	680.9211126195794
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	721.2645434330886
Who is that beside them?	351.33164607216696
Ah, the brother - in - law.	834.7900599255472
All walked after.	2526.9343299830134
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	1086.3345423952733
— What?	128.22159737738772
Mr Power whispered.	3288.232605703989
How so?	246.23388358513958
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	1693.1790184062227
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	1111.0183802185852
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	1114.1834004358175
Anniversary.	21558.06072352106
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	1306.0176004209452
First I heard of it.	836.0319623215082
Poisoned himself?	1250.4766789167006
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	839.2710560485823
Speaking.	13137.782459902772
— Was he insured?	588.3703689949423
Mr Bloom asked.	1465.5393185173311
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	874.9154355187636
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	3106.9600039112097
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	2375.4164678539387
— How many children did he leave?	631.3592009400487
— Five.	2274.7786318297135
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	919.9381353865836
Five young children.	4534.4613252185
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	905.6440691227875
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	1454.1917588468314
Has the laugh at him now.	1070.4748575519004
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	1176.624665149431
She had outlived him.	2681.0849881334043
Lost her husband.	4968.656664113609
More dead for her than for me.	1103.9131623650499
One must outlive the other.	2984.6959467115785
Wise men say.	5499.530057403438
There are more women than men in the world.	1040.71264395412
Condole with her.	3139.625067201535
Your terrible loss.	6863.520647433504
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	1174.9751527789301
For Hindu widows only.	12746.46683125008
She would marry another.	2821.8707265055414
Him?	303.19170255740534
No. Yet who knows after.	5484.176830929005
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	1904.9940826633779
Drawn on a guncarriage.	6335.625356118588
Victoria and Albert.	2643.7444527543303
Frogmore memorial mourning.	29835.015884839075
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	509.05768927861465
Vain in her heart of hearts.	1761.2748291696048
All for a shadow.	1151.7846503466578
Consort not even a king.	3258.983177444909
Her son was the substance.	1331.4521362202709
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	866.7393216594091
It never comes.	2691.6817978522176
— How are you, Simon?	247.05816136145333
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	2532.1305844259764
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	1566.3762788329143
— Never better.	2171.749489133239
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	460.59115447200196
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	963.2969328471587
Same old six and eightpence.	2444.0944682768077
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	2228.011448358035
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	348.51459151329476
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	1452.8305713813102
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	1383.4508145503835
Dick Tivy bald?	2452.92552983686
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	1002.394388253254
A few bob a skull.	2150.812534059234
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	779.9394224832296
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	876.2754596534878
Is that the eldest boy in front?	216.14439975211283
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	448.80837244561934
John Henry Menton is behind.	2473.0446829901143
He put down his name for a quid.	801.7912716798968
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	716.9556011114829
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	1363.0515134125658
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	691.6741602010934
— How did he lose it?	339.4201698818374
Ned Lambert asked.	3689.8461898340634
Liquor, what?	468.0610872577029
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	588.5134825998441
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	553.431360995807
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	1458.1056121925692
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	460.26017233830186
Both unconscious.	12831.42156358501
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	1185.6396096950054
All he might have done.	1493.826525886269
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	1917.0180218895205
Would he understand?	461.1253473432899
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	1936.7546154727831
Which end is his head?	459.6955953139712
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	868.1932022516556
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	2419.80556826655
Always in front of us.	1260.1463465572378
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	1278.4878547112482
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	2043.029740553634
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	1132.9780123867765
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	1026.1573226848077
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	725.4763655342235
Who ’ ll read the book?	342.02481472753584
I, said the rook.	785.6770353027165
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	1124.7834624007776
Father Coffey.	8551.776469207738
I knew his name was like a coffin.	725.7724907497623
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	3341.195484997297
Bosses the show.	4173.955786098792
Muscular christian.	18504.749715669077
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	4101.479601514129
Thou art Peter.	6396.0429511985485
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	2272.61721654937
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	1467.8935830423736
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	6741.723712875721
Hhhn: burst sideways.	7162.75997896852
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	2896.0158760874647
Requiem mass.	17184.453396229885
Crape weepers.	39616.09131016968
Blackedged notepaper.	31633.267610030063
Your name on the altarlist.	2414.382591102001
Chilly place this.	7366.210667615458
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	816.6553574886767
Eyes of a toad too.	1931.3737357716213
What swells him up that way?	370.28539878738286
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	6876.90503391689
Air of the place maybe.	784.419454603665
Looks full up of bad gas.	2218.4843968958703
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	1854.8450196744523
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	2288.248883397886
Who was telling me?	358.3414898082236
Mervyn Browne.	31362.37528359212
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	1219.310951584085
Out it rushes: blue.	2044.2469592593336
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	531.7012576286124
My kneecap is hurting me.	7737.173583580706
Ow. That ’ s better.	3019.100350568261
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	540.2979202353417
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	725.7058686216359
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	606.9314250294788
As you were before you rested.	1571.5979061495193
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	507.30517925963625
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	880.3980303357973
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	1191.5170503257125
Up to fifteen or so.	1695.7111107412127
After that, of course...	3061.9077430666925
Holy water that was, I expect.	889.0718317980114
Shaking sleep out of it.	1810.2185318666902
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	921.1909321798095
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	900.0374555638185
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	1867.09401730175
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	764.4659960103817
On Dignam now.	2890.4165635925997
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	1202.570672619254
Says that over everybody.	3800.311719779143
Tiresome kind of a job.	2121.486959503244
But he has to say something.	949.804167783901
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	558.91229579949
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	660.7437293781719
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	812.2077680492761
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	1297.9825471016197
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	1569.5278699673665
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	832.3167489647856
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	1767.725058040932
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	629.1893251973296
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	1583.073866131514
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	664.6700464711978
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	1022.0305326631384
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	291.772361117218
But his heart is buried in Rome.	1377.1376610628806
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	1019.8778121313528
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	1280.9410738007766
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	3146.074548956819
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	759.7790327858432
Mr Power took his arm.	1747.5640558906161
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	521.1798112682001
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	798.9632118861849
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	722.8284308287732
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	2038.874424223981
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	1396.6892177009738
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	792.5138809630653
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	931.8748173155716
I suppose we can do so too.	1195.2061935759534
We are the last.	1026.3345476899574
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	3457.4416870429413
They covered their heads.	3130.9841571216534
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	513.8024161922907
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	1915.2322952287243
Mason, I think: not sure.	1190.706117166076
Beside him again.	615.3795365098981
We are the last.	1026.3345476899574
In the same boat.	1550.6895129307964
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	1546.9336232139087
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	1612.788224567796
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	4041.9891929784167
The language of course was another thing.	1087.3535134806125
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	1500.5263535516092
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	1975.929279685362
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	617.3042571495205
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	658.2756145662643
No touching that.	2014.1231279411477
Seat of the affections.	3221.0548712021314
Broken heart.	10414.179424172095
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	1551.166213619457
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	1292.4059579005261
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	1287.3233076728238
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	2931.5926235932916
The resurrection and the life.	1159.709213714748
Once you are dead you are dead.	1482.5128888656407
That last day idea.	2500.546924295105
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	1877.5399173113187
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	1193.6488563898474
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	1249.6239630335576
Find damn all of himself that morning.	1666.9192726273545
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	2753.157755026293
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	18284.157621702823
Troy measure.	7026.516982352117
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	2671.4582356134624
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	708.0416289789208
What?	122.71942533465327
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	1408.8546367229073
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	2267.3811608798483
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	3933.963605900843
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	758.6172996208728
— What?	128.22159737738772
Corny Kelleher said.	2978.2275372315694
Mr Kernan assured him.	2292.2593717980567
John Henry Menton asked.	3448.641064486839
I know his face.	829.9778470473025
Ned Lambert glanced back.	3933.393993078909
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	442.795951470614
She ’ s his wife.	641.2071207271747
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	595.615910479614
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	851.9834909519752
She was a finelooking woman.	1805.4171225662537
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	614.7899511493657
And a good armful she was.	1384.4457935439361
He looked behind through the others.	1233.2755308739452
— What is he?	141.9207216562166
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
What does he do?	295.85842957205153
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	741.2857592070942
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	839.9719736007187
Ned Lambert smiled.	4768.627795185632
A traveller for blottingpaper.	3523.968410128091
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	485.6759706696132
She had plenty of game in her then.	921.2489965742488
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	1271.2677617115726
He does some canvassing for ads.	2951.046707625192
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	2244.4070425287027
The barrow turned into a side lane.	859.3156726105292
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	1176.4151504931965
The gravediggers touched their caps.	3163.0300372821966
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	915.3503172039403
He never forgets a friend.	2216.170746779319
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	1187.3491793199805
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	876.5993465824174
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	920.2369123707233
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	907.2049336588586
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	1710.3634104445534
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	382.8194800835423
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	623.5356885761103
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	1937.0287751124124
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	1472.5218155209757
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	736.796441367835
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	1072.1167781235993
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	1740.1076026620215
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	2349.763081824943
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	1068.5963386800586
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	1503.0513128667944
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	598.4665478205866
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	2513.777216751566
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	1519.0102806237633
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	742.5136188612145
— I know, Hynes said.	586.4326556667548
I know that.	775.6028154837749
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	890.3188699787385
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	1616.536295991031
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	1596.0763067202527
All want to be on good terms with him.	864.6690883504849
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	740.514955230698
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	1332.6616816351464
No passout checks.	20074.49469667481
_Habeas corpus_.	50041.95876441744
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	934.6606986650995
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	1004.6223972670908
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	1117.4187508436953
Be the better of a shave.	895.2910922847055
Grey sprouting beard.	24674.277518029165
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	790.1474746407166
And temper getting cross.	1384.1988417457853
Silver threads among the grey.	5681.575158187848
Fancy being his wife.	3288.401424855651
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	1615.5260266909058
Come out and live in the graveyard.	1129.6370569998094
Dangle that before her.	2786.9170210121865
It might thrill her first.	2743.2643227272265
Courting death.	14047.403493487938
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	2096.571183256008
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	1194.639420684099
Will o ’ the wisp.	2671.035324209516
Gas of graves.	7015.71822214024
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	1149.0479961141111
Women especially are so touchy.	6596.203455752686
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	1127.6636933207499
Have you ever seen a ghost?	582.5248550717045
Well, I have.	638.9460294483628
It was a pitchdark night.	2085.6014800654625
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	432.4373273865102
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	2272.0915662357525
Learn anything if taken young.	4753.678810746355
You might pick up a young widow here.	1746.034745721903
Men like that.	453.94081196901993
Love among the tombstones.	4651.669921321596
Romeo.	15787.963800563719
Spice of pleasure.	5119.130716494788
In the midst of death we are in life.	994.3993449896521
Both ends meet.	6769.525758220615
Tantalising for the poor dead.	2289.357945418407
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	1352.073119664255
Gnawing their vitals.	14798.521659785294
Desire to grig people.	9624.957589565798
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	456.02953089030825
Eight children he has anyway.	4173.959470438193
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	857.0104256569182
Holy fields.	6856.316591073803
More room if they buried them standing.	2764.6902939433485
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	359.1969393217825
Standing?	849.7949504514035
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	1535.1322691941432
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	2724.266103223909
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	6260.516423363732
Well, so it is.	605.1348091312567
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	1383.935146896329
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	7113.832993269822
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	4185.636937566603
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	849.0727654096715
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	2229.865752838048
Every man his price.	2416.1864653297416
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	3479.9653488877047
A bargain.	3194.4204025140643
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	2819.341726523165
With thanks.	4330.769097573529
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	1397.3459805799416
Charnelhouses.	21558.06072352106
Dreadful.	13137.782459902772
Turning green and pink decomposing.	2323.479443616182
Rot quick in damp earth.	5971.837780025408
The lean old ones tougher.	6096.6751218446725
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	1394.2948522519011
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	1775.5078595598102
Then dried up.	4301.757108887651
Deathmoths.	21558.06072352106
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	1949.0529661436751
Changing about.	6210.618738688204
Live for ever practically.	1031.5039423072585
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	1879.2438944705
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	1641.1940003595055
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	1572.0083429354002
Your head it simply swurls.	4477.435960902674
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	10166.194057362305
He looks cheerful enough over it.	2617.8448016584116
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	1378.768245217414
Wonder how he looks at life.	1834.4546397927293
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	1206.2648538144642
The one about the bulletin.	1598.5341713461287
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	4445.408843220293
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	2531.047262412017
Not arrived yet.	10573.139185593558
Peter.	5268.119875574054
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	786.8434975113499
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	1065.5204539859394
Keep out the damp.	1641.4799800181568
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	1482.2553221663402
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	5141.991414481621
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	1733.841787545296
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	1469.8297171540987
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	129292.3960172208
Go out of mourning first.	1646.4785079270164
Hard to imagine his funeral.	2007.8112412707726
Seems a sort of a joke.	1128.1178446725155
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	3459.133483786908
Gives you second wind.	4493.327660681288
New lease of life.	3568.5324372503137
— How many have you for tomorrow?	440.2874844055651
the caretaker asked.	1555.4500218390738
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	1169.1861629453488
Half ten and eleven.	2663.3680635761375
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	978.1805652734622
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	1446.931704148421
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	1023.7163379608704
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	1427.5599647896133
Burying him.	4764.045824923534
We come to bury Cæsar.	3865.1259033963343
His ides of March or June.	1589.3627710391372
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	1307.402795601558
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	1033.1712045898776
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	286.13771211108735
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	839.3950612894415
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	2410.7250441554897
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	1462.1315864298172
Yes, he could.	650.8617118515446
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	1214.9509084713302
We all do.	1553.610771265591
Only man buries.	6713.5698574294975
No, ants too.	2480.218216980736
First thing strikes anybody.	5627.140622698264
Bury the dead.	3120.0890636462955
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	1450.4684770950935
Well then Friday buried him.	2764.5146735399826
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	1540.5157856620576
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	513.8749715974316
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	1094.044389503263
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	966.3240316084215
All gnawed through.	6372.858832762386
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	762.8989349787466
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	926.4019938319037
They ’ re so particular.	1624.974893998194
Lay me in my native earth.	1827.2835910263773
Bit of clay from the holy land.	1402.3861350433735
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	1570.5345422613668
I see what it means.	1036.0023675928585
I see.	1135.9875471135967
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	1281.0967669113018
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	883.7287791899553
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	4202.127121918367
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	778.9890617405154
Twelve.	5659.915422629268
I ’ m thirteen.	1249.9083316218346
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	2044.5193062459
Death ’ s number.	498.9641092771155
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	504.2711954493635
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	313.808174597202
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	4767.157820424224
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	2523.193574490107
Tinge of purple.	5455.897886899785
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	1054.9666407450427
Dressy fellow he was once.	2785.7238926421446
Used to change three suits in the day.	1625.956212658868
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	1050.5810170882958
Hello.	4990.896473038367
It ’ s dyed.	1630.9418755895988
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	1091.003262113043
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	2051.3518619160527
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	1230.9223489926153
Twenty.	5849.244559282841
Pause.	21558.06072352106
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	2595.9469136288017
Far away a donkey brayed.	8536.10225681427
Rain.	13137.782459902772
No such ass.	3729.0387581502523
Never see a dead one, they say.	800.7047872559876
Shame of death.	3060.917922652925
They hide.	3953.2989000713374
Also poor papa went away.	3929.4756558635845
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	2655.738452140712
Whisper.	648.4142163114785
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	1471.734895148993
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	2740.0413022769044
Wellcut frockcoat.	18354.158958401753
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	1834.18748679542
Well, it is a long rest.	650.3255274667603
Feel no more.	2812.60260508501
It ’ s the moment you feel.	610.7498413744546
Must be damned unpleasant.	5620.856428540552
Can ’ t believe it at first.	1015.0620244328818
Mistake must be: someone else.	3240.817705241504
Try the house opposite.	2081.544615270161
Wait, I wanted to.	683.0223201098459
I haven ’ t yet.	1238.7297392235287
Then darkened deathchamber.	11965.070352664798
Light they want.	2912.268074946386
Whispering around you.	4718.692105334797
Would you like to see a priest?	340.1810461015832
Then rambling and wandering.	3828.070972221504
Delirium all you hid all your life.	2437.9050444947493
His sleep is not natural.	1897.721201773383
Press his lower eyelid.	8977.538211448253
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	1724.6945279803003
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	1160.7068378803356
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	972.8898753403213
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	1436.6103903145886
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	1196.0531928162077
Bam! He expires.	8522.0250324701
Gone at last.	2554.486465323231
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	1158.692273067882
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	946.90568619536
Remember him in your prayers.	1598.0502456776078
Even Parnell.	6476.100064021355
Ivy day dying out.	5890.4566078567295
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	806.6607292221723
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	1082.8828397752332
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	1118.7453661786083
Nice change of air.	2184.566126456088
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	1161.103547244558
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	502.51337241309074
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	988.4603419225473
Someone walking over it.	2285.8664309782444
Near you.	2501.1567752019437
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	1912.1146782506914
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	713.2523114726848
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	1399.450338136547
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	1137.1171880009344
And if he was alive all the time?	267.0203783467299
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	750.478262975095
Of course he is dead.	1480.2054928300856
Monday he died.	2658.780231320986
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	1117.1433191132253
Flag of distress.	12206.593312296927
Three days.	4406.355901892281
Rather long to keep them in summer.	1455.68232805429
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	734.28195391872
The clay fell softer.	1342.7588898261893
Begin to be forgotten.	2777.574750659175
Out of sight, out of mind.	742.2847856788138
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	1336.6058787090662
Had enough of it.	1286.6095417085435
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	1238.6168968157083
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	1330.1873166553216
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	842.5338467527978
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	3267.195790295861
Ah, the names.	841.320150503685
But he knows them all.	1073.7553475656862
No: coming to me.	803.8835156278835
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	940.7144947501673
What is your christian name?	489.6611698510242
I ’ m not sure.	899.6733396874051
Leopold.	4074.909419816308
He asked me to.	773.5611517291128
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	1372.2253819866394
I know.	1189.6598921535906
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	1102.4139232807206
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	1574.2640208798084
Find out what they imagine they know.	2111.829648598469
He died of a Tuesday.	973.4994617948385
Got the run.	1810.321498289135
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	1504.8656929892202
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	989.9403441337856
That was why he asked me to.	738.2470672254544
O well, does no harm.	1352.5074193194532
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	509.48240306989146
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	1951.697587888666
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	4042.534697710258
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	621.9960523798563
He looked around.	2307.397953506676
— Macintosh.	6187.047731104077
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	403.6598014415657
Where is he now?	238.35005569649647
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	1382.3153797902053
I don ’ t know who he is.	592.3764117366072
Is that his name?	248.29267423645754
He moved away, looking about him.	933.7975012191971
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	670.1599063291554
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	828.5835371009373
What?	122.71942533465327
Where has he disappeared to?	362.2581357511121
Not a sign.	1880.1049598113775
Well of all the.	508.22510840228796
Has anybody here seen?	1090.1169718529288
Kay ee double ell.	19274.1348156035
Become invisible.	18603.321514966345
Good Lord, what became of him?	343.06829321434674
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	3774.4004452751833
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	1199.8859598349025
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	415.4628282514219
It rose.	3060.2036942995383
Nearly over.	7474.329654192024
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	1666.9186348917426
All uncovered again for a few instants.	3115.4520625752157
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	619.0250978997746
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	1404.970009202799
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	1989.81997610301
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	1360.0684779428545
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	2344.5303383348905
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	2367.1561663832254
His navelcord.	7351.22157995783
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	895.6120732871394
Thanks in silence.	2483.5984637872325
Sorry, sir: trouble.	1798.9440810692065
Headshake.	21558.06072352106
I know that.	775.6028154837749
For yourselves just.	7182.575642757269
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	2324.960012843754
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	745.811617903426
— Let us, Mr Power said.	828.7014675104
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	1009.0281126078036
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	649.2385391294488
That the coffin was filled with stones.	1286.2235275036473
That one day he will come again.	1174.8152245017036
Hynes shook his head.	2464.0226771872954
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	789.6485404941869
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	325.14050609509917
Peace to his ashes.	2479.1353431107577
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	2097.0250420462467
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	1774.5248636627239
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	549.8958319253853
Does anybody really?	1163.042978758104
Plant him and have done with him.	1275.2608789506664
Like down a coalshoot.	3664.6245854392855
Then lump them together to save time.	2047.8674836972398
All souls ’ day.	1748.2043048667463
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	1293.3664599639212
Ten shillings for the gardener.	2376.7939314491596
He keeps it free of weeds.	1491.4420299790847
Old man himself.	2595.6686769907838
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	2823.9856262734324
Near death ’ s door.	1515.0528385651694
Who passed away.	2895.7875094042097
Who departed this life.	2919.7686641042183
As if they did it of their own accord.	584.6500646790926
Got the shove, all of them.	561.90903284195
Who kicked the bucket.	2189.292104662702
So and So, wheelwright.	1709.398662206534
I travelled for cork lino.	547.209554101263
I paid five shillings in the pound.	1221.441570935416
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	857.3643192979163
I cooked good Irish stew.	1442.308649329725
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	1960.0536165852238
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	1219.9334046630563
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	2969.8473097866904
The great physician called him home.	2759.1430696724688
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	744.6672787469716
Nice country residence.	6324.268311820465
Newly plastered and painted.	2197.0658212352964
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	3099.602758002191
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	4793.016831599477
Better value that for the money.	1144.0137554488556
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	1451.0408835418073
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	3445.776017236851
Expresses nothing.	13890.002329327957
Immortelles.	21558.06072352106
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	3423.691905737593
Like stuffed.	1086.9729080166699
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	1799.688048332865
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	1769.8553805833424
Dead animal even sadder.	12341.477399697149
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	1837.327932386438
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	1171.7528546738854
Heart on his sleeve.	1887.069375577159
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	1202.0819305371124
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	1392.6521905826544
Seems anything but pleased.	4323.764553909395
Why this infliction?	1307.9921059763358
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	835.6341046092883
Apollo that was.	2464.9501409104423
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	2202.412845657238
Besides how could you remember everybody?	998.3553405601355
Eyes, walk, voice.	983.8174847123005
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	299.792524713416
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	535.9100847004755
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	3951.912138870501
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	121184.69386288783
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	396.4191444510055
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	1217.188351017604
For instance who?	574.0980984771777
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	1033.3668641088566
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	1335.7726217579414
Wait.	4301.167531310137
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	1373.8052271021575
Some animal.	6202.180116305541
Wait.	4301.167531310137
There he goes.	1861.707873580765
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	2318.9277966036084
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	2159.801859295892
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	1777.905045571714
Good hidingplace for treasure.	6590.221512404764
Who lives there?	490.1434466727933
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	3313.898187783666
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	924.6724128783557
Making his rounds.	7615.9342531462335
Tail gone now.	8126.630922810315
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	1216.6076181616995
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	1794.5792077327299
Ordinary meat for them.	4515.885476557714
A corpse is meat gone bad.	2790.0364634987764
Well and what ’ s cheese?	278.6795055568445
Corpse of milk.	3545.9749715447674
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	1099.5719084635516
Cremation better.	13368.026504100422
Priests dead against it.	4088.8078364898834
Devilling for the other firm.	2523.713396584201
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	40478.115821782
Time of the plague.	374.9177634045463
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	7726.185695780524
Lethal chamber.	18504.749715669077
Ashes to ashes.	5133.129263548149
Or bury at sea.	3069.9112056744825
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	926.2506890829663
Eaten by birds.	6708.003289722213
Earth, fire, water.	1604.5598560865326
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	2943.8687611919772
See your whole life in a flash.	1472.574095975904
But being brought back to life no.	1356.472458976906
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	1064.9123890633991
Out of a flying machine.	1757.8289322988962
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	1398.5401733333804
Underground communication.	39616.09131016968
We learned that from them.	1374.3620603187162
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	1707.6762193352315
Regular square feed for them.	4400.85836253036
Got wind of Dignam.	2198.7286661883645
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	730.3658043241053
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	6215.0554302316095
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	2682.5553564226548
Back to the world again.	1023.8923571919789
Enough of this place.	542.5387056333952
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	841.2569635040553
Poor papa too.	3962.2912967653647
The love that kills.	1631.5536872324715
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	1676.7961864346837
Give you the creeps after a bit.	1274.6300689956277
I will appear to you after death.	1032.8540320219254
You will see my ghost after death.	1847.5781658951307
My ghost will haunt you after death.	3494.3541082929864
There is another world after death named hell.	2558.487461795666
I do not like that other world she wrote.	912.0235239105625
No more do I.	1180.5611499237082
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	1539.88601015445
Feel live warm beings near you.	3861.6196382015223
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	3076.9740412501787
They are not going to get me this innings.	1649.933699471048
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	2733.844878059107
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	3121.029981310244
Solicitor, I think.	1969.553470549104
I know his face.	829.9778470473025
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	1808.9183849603987
Dignam used to be in his office.	892.6764683523527
Convivial evenings.	18812.731941147817
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	3569.147514644059
Heart of gold really.	2427.6024329525926
Yes, Menton.	1374.227420488196
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	1504.5916423676124
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	3557.390219560052
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	1884.9634387542833
Hate at first sight.	4168.392487415388
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	2229.2882397723515
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	900.2807756671609
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	818.036888238671
Carriage probably.	17083.55314808259
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	616.855100139095
They stopped.	3628.742556522872
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	857.4120963802827
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	2073.1474297694904
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	1273.5526020819757
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	1965.90546055672
He clapped the hat on his head again.	805.7164724037787
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	581.1865352912688
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	3095.548037887578
— Thank you, he said shortly.	694.1746176667613
They walked on towards the gates.	1365.0090132083187
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	1544.222955411748
Martin laying down the law.	1785.1407407375332
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	1121.2950508816473
Oyster eyes.	10126.22087393182
Never mind.	4454.416918001886
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	2466.487767127177
Get the pull over him that way.	1026.2147697974822
Thank you.	2367.521374822112
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	2942.0032782019857
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	2312.879409787165
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	2797.1678987319087
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	2164.0144823402547
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	3215.647207626168
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	2862.4652622521135
— There it is, Red Murray said.	818.5113461085951
Alexander Keyes.	6856.316591073803
— Just cut it out, will you?	283.62792000186346
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	306.26919364445394
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	810.0441480545524
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	985.7019750629754
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	1441.1779383599999
Scissors and paste.	8800.717969808817
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	643.974601051734
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	732.6582668872259
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	595.5194789887524
I ’ ll rub that in.	830.3122863580829
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	2489.6446645972924
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	3946.7596709413165
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	1925.1335045436283
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	4412.966668070694
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	460.92851801671793
Welts of flesh behind on him.	2005.4715966893878
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	1073.3237552499493
— Don ’ t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	488.48650566513686
Red Murray whispered.	7357.964398232136
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	1859.4494491923624
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	776.8656990270389
Way in.	1941.4682482992255
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	733.9081686801014
Mary, Martha.	1807.3905825921029
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	1472.7190738055867
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	970.9121593888849
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	1823.482132002876

They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	1634.310487613086
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	843.5319675450435
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	808.584880718579
But will he save the circulation?	423.9313005746945
Thumping.	13137.782459902772
Thumping.	13137.782459902772
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	2925.9258756147096
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	1849.9785250791394

HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	5225.652258735573

Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	3374.4330806187886
Long John is backing him, they say.	1485.7573557111145
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	562.8878806165628
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	1908.4774440726192
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	1268.1513949718926
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	784.4479630409649
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	632.8866345834912
— Did you?	200.97657906240264
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	1100.9469132310383
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	1111.1831204346508
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	657.0068877930453
I ’ ll tap him too.	918.9856746496616
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	1040.9848869223697

WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	5689.499277875216
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	534.8770934105511
Keyes, you remember?	290.2229373356696
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	2171.249097278827
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	694.050445185513
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	1835.7546298153816
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	657.4015960819818
He wants it changed.	1883.0480310081505
Keyes, you see.	942.2870066580941
He wants two keys at the top.	1352.359138212853
Hell of a racket they make.	2007.070955638191
He doesn ’ t hear it.	974.2874361503372
Nannan.	13137.782459902772
Iron nerves.	12975.8599347642
Maybe he understands what I.	819.8365642241619
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	901.9154523493934
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	686.7821377200155
Let him take that in first.	942.2130372211129
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	1033.5412654281104
Clank it.	4986.538028567877
Clank it.	4986.538028567877
Miles of it unreeled.	5056.9653087517845
What becomes of it after?	278.03806555282983
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	1440.537465153596
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	3043.838845902534
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	2248.3272282851894
Two crossed keys here.	4577.798862144216

Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	1640.3265355165877
So on.	1710.214904642105
Better not teach him his own business.	1817.971800254956
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	825.9528651860702
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	1018.531338784174
You see?	219.36047960810362
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	310.7664836596821
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	1839.8589417942344
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	385.25018608293345
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	1502.778228331652
Innuendo of home rule.	4999.909779077052
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	934.7818626646404
Catches the eye, you see.	948.655470294005
Can you do that?	273.8849100671656
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	780.0581183276294
Better not.	2628.7062978257836
— We can do that, the foreman said.	563.2438686958797
Have you the design?	309.3722251239487
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	444.4098053241038
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	927.3667297851828
He has a house there too.	862.4883678338343
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	776.3888806530829
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	931.5356960383808
Longfelt want.	12510.077790689716
So on.	1710.214904642105
The foreman thought for an instant.	1847.4152368324303
— We can do that, he said.	480.5073515153337
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	817.9206205835695
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	4279.30330348843
He began to check it silently.	2590.1184735447328
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	1692.7539069414975

I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	1136.0438279424375
Thank you.	2367.521374822112
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	855.0544396848103

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	2863.9441297173867
— Monks, sir?	232.1070780318536
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	978.5493550812613
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	1069.5914516123748
Time to get out.	1345.3326423741494
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	369.3126687170184

Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	819.9245741584618
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	719.8803023297893
Better phone him up first.	2991.695445061311

Ah, the soap I put there.	698.4374940997754

Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	886.8376276405029

No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	3450.9343144699315
Know who that is.	1357.2722126392289
What ’ s up?	141.57528612275118
Ned Lambert it is.	1583.3071851939649
He entered softly.	3285.8352777074574
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	5638.139994362206
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	695.5843781072629
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	1555.3335375419247
What about that, Simon?	213.3614147582236
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	728.5318418978162
How ’ s that for high?	213.7791481286254
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	1008.667190717948
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	1473.3699113658595
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	652.2379871918819
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	927.5016172284683
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	639.1275058096973
High falutin stuff.	15518.904141124056
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	1142.4541916622047
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	1081.1689000241158
He has influence they say.	1653.875810938582
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	2021.6484238083826

— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	1861.308447657484
— What is it?	149.07323958384464
Mr Bloom asked.	1465.5393185173311
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	2469.817827245659
_Our lovely land_.	30840.90937221208
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	4714.232494852062
Mr Bloom said simply.	1344.552153546285
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	1922.5201019250535
With an accent on the whose.	1285.3661081899868
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	1120.6860079788373
— Is it his speech last night?	441.2789869864528
Mr Bloom asked.	1465.5393185173311
— But listen to this, he said.	526.3075427402197
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	661.1781039315043
— Excuse me, J.	870.5256297280636
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said, entering.	877.2730217328549
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	3025.298214901592
— I beg yours, he said.	670.1956461511029
— Good day, Jack.	1070.8704646859637
— Come in.	896.3769210232108
Come in.	1410.3832270851415
— Good day.	1640.312754339666

O ’ Molloy shook his head.	1302.9024826348718
SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	2480.808340036091
Decline, poor chap.	3202.9460057924975
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	5579.516900788671
Touch and go with him.	923.3998708760747
What ’ s in the wind, I wonder.	362.03281685236146
Money worry.	2861.236469091757
— _Or again if we but climb the serried mountain <URL> — You ’ re looking extra.	842.2152329055527

J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	995.335709420243
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	1223.0917980673178
To be seen and heard.	1329.2186759755427
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	798.9495393683069

J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	867.4205147235402
Practice dwindling.	31362.37528359212
A mighthavebeen.	8500.371147137086

Their wigs to show the grey matter.	2441.239577347368
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	1923.2121299509122
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	3437.06018605686
Wellread fellow.	12442.586990890033
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	1475.5290740316404
Weathercocks.	21558.06072352106
Hot and cold in the same breath.	1009.8945593400982
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	1076.3665102409643
One story good till you hear the next.	1596.1823652159399
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	1229.041256340629
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	2942.3427833418577
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	1057.8764782078035
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	3276.769855506567
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	1650.396655464353
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	244.19163130060656
Is he taking anything for it?	397.37620791128387
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	4048.583653653812
He forgot Hamlet.	3269.167866366817
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	1169.6092063668577
Life is too short.	2538.514461427206
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	1931.2598223348418
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	2609.5030380660237
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	2043.6568641581678
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	3292.337413730897
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	2847.255732564654
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	335.7626997964423
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	5475.803169858461
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	7609.5462804555345
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	2487.8909344218973
Hooked that nicely.	7004.972335317436
Entertainments.	15787.963800563719

Big blowout.	14298.1640523745
Wetherup always said that.	2397.5058625057463
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	1051.315597014023
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	1306.9355284875332
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	597.8052460366113
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	2869.7764696470103
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	1694.7714812832812
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	500.86019332833047
I must get a drink after that.	846.2046512272195
— Drink! the editor cried.	1240.753532843477
No drinks served before mass.	4579.078860207416
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	633.19982193633
Come on, Ned.	978.800300356792
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	2681.1219992780493
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	1019.7321616545723
— Will you join us, Myles?	468.5554715497078
Ned Lambert asked.	3689.8461898340634
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	4606.467324639092
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	726.3829030630346
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	2848.803649904004
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	1871.1994843310613
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	1163.7064815261617
Passing out he whispered to J.	1766.7366917110478
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	3206.4851523528077
Sad case.	5202.281973707492
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	888.1302260541906
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	1919.1292531587442
Long, short and long.	1084.5118559691277
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	1786.6890516599196
— Bingbang, bangbang.	5193.6535043773365
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	875.524540672708
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	468.64717005815635
I just want to phone about an ad.	1733.5026561993434
He went in.	907.5358998287355
— What about that leader this evening?	489.06103550525086
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	875.055082176121
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	900.1205545256047
Never you fret.	6676.430551270937
Hello, Jack.	1760.403372320916
That ’ s all right.	702.7065965827944
— Good day, Myles, J.	728.4628130069996
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	1102.5077118150596
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	571.9222256318143
The telephone whirred inside.	6223.716298383875
— Twentyeight...	5844.8996994071185
Double four...	49540.6825348101
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	2498.532336352234
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	805.0816846874427
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
Sceptre with O.	1790.5745850355363
Madden up.	2712.7307548759613
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	689.322843266787
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	1469.9013540117162
— Hush, Lenehan said.	1402.4541874145852
I hear feetstoops.	4990.457018697568
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	1426.3393696730275
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	1112.0138629062892
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	650.241951016634
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	805.6880497896049
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	606.9213350788588
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	1850.0687997453429
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	713.0431645920776
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	848.7490767644515
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	1424.700209373095
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	1702.9253872382837
— Him, sir.	983.5022284369163
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	1037.6513973446354
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	1158.1257212981964
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	1640.8408847943322
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	1163.7359460752352
Is the boss...?	6417.154576383456
Yes, _Telegraph_...	3717.8535526950936
To where?	299.0904098787692
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	9901.764370731014
Aha! I see...	6798.605303352057
Right.	5268.119875574054
I ’ ll catch him.	881.0288967779433
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	4811.4165496912465
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	811.8102256553472
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	1222.5108191190532
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	912.8983858033657
Are you hurt?	500.9262856657751
I ’ m in a hurry.	601.0257308638174
— Knee, Lenehan said.	1602.7557952836942
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	2045.0829784752111
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	875.3288759198349
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	617.6601727969613
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	1530.4092597056317
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	1104.5883167412264
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	675.4992867982675
Want to fix it up.	1960.1227030606956
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	529.3587779256784
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	1710.047208187625
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	994.5662472812681
— Begone! he said.	1229.482340742389
The world is before you.	987.146914414455
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	656.92559726548
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	943.7269850745427
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	804.584989317716
Look at the young scamps after him.	1787.654819000471
— Show.	2274.7786318297135
Where?	188.90416504930744
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	842.6649142349542
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	1705.9755451680776
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	742.9502446558333
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	2047.9503481822626
Small nines.	27324.731655759035
Steal upon larks.	27440.083144535292
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	1330.712264422137
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	1477.1507935524367
— What ’ s that?	121.33936717810553
Myles Crawford said with a start.	1454.2027757299634
Where are the other two gone?	391.0809485711836
— Who?	168.13827833536334
the professor said, turning.	697.2385181096481
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	1049.8497019294612
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	3916.5970039381855
Came over last night.	3956.99553337316
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	876.2824458268129
Where ’ s my hat?	252.09928141979643
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	817.1157020075925
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	1065.0427405426165
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	623.3470256120607
— Seems to be, J.	643.5260683245162
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	861.9333127840646
Who has the most matches?	470.2191100202957
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	2016.0009360835447
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	1510.2165099094095
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	1069.8125504577129
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	1229.4247169981536
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	1036.5411057511521
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	2522.520824303173
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	2650.9484752046037
— Eh?	244.8296642096275
You bloody old Roman empire?	963.9987450091637
Myles Crawford said.	2843.7398906325457
He took a cigarette from the open case.	966.7674431464972
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	1168.664208107263
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said gently.	1382.56111424187
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	8708.977144162618
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	1091.5612084374118
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	3324.544085616947
— That ’ s it, he said.	280.15830751329753
We are the fat.	1225.6792287646595
You and I are the fat in the fire.	438.72195239606776
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	1148.903979662078
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	3760.043806963519
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	1131.5495978278655
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	1080.681529651486
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	2605.9768796811663
Vast, I allow: but vile.	937.2213538389866
Cloacae: sewers.	15342.753049983246
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	1063.3289113620217
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	2000.6757321569546
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	1056.3706586532155
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	877.9183550573599
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	1394.274310587863
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	999.1544444838473
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	732.7292413503166
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy murmured.	1965.0846914072831
But we have also Roman law.	2688.7934390091946
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	2496.65692415146
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	1629.6538521981042
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy asked.	1418.0593238354109
Everything was going swimmingly...	9137.904727540745
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	1093.046756715533
Are you ready?	486.3249986737331
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	1152.1840350713587
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	871.71555470639
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	3384.2062002452776
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	9605.740380472924
— How do you do?	283.74401035151305
the editor said, holding out a hand.	580.4386068097674
Come in.	1410.3832270851415
Your governor is just gone.	1181.615038353757

Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	1037.019354095479
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	4266.552565864062
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	786.2412690154043
— Who?	168.13827833536334
the editor asked.	1453.7210437917797
Bit torn off.	4624.414661772529
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	1182.0459555023
— That old pelters, the editor said.	1060.3958561378645
Who tore it?	402.93237732733286
Was he short taken?	668.0649909815198
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	2387.1917007992824
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	619.6729802729649
Foot and mouth?	337.77226981817216
Are you turned...?	7111.360096836367
Bullockbefriending bard.	14853.878166325845
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	4702.530222724156
The letter is not mine.	1455.5118198589405
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	7134.0178689602
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	393.56179876865735
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	5845.435969551736
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	719.273084160016
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	2131.467315959621
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	1297.3449352592822
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	1391.2766356477505
— Is he a widower?	273.3413900174484
Stephen asked.	2112.661370998925
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	810.2325825248747
Emperor ’ s horses.	2441.437762818295
Habsburg.	21558.06072352106
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	1135.0973301351173
Don ’ t you forget! Maximilian Karl O ’ Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	2456.0884381966325
Going to be trouble there one day.	1382.22890665278
Wild geese.	12941.565531056425
O yes, every time.	1009.4983226861058
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	817.8428500422139
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	2234.822534502301
Saving princes is a thank you job.	3137.7423185048387
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	2108.337362054013
— And if not?	204.9407657110996
he said.	856.4235297911396
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	696.5669280062015
A Hungarian it was one day...	4249.535290155812
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	3517.77300384312
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	395.555369310669
We were never loyal to the successful.	1271.0480170355472
We serve them.	2834.4454941996237
I teach the blatant Latin language.	2858.9899463674938
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	993.5389540235265
Material domination.	39616.09131016968
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	858.0315253863569
Lord Jesus?	513.3799775438252
Lord Salisbury?	1578.9460692775674
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	2920.258046203721
— The Greek! he said again.	746.9751240112471
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	2185.5397431359856
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	836.964911057321
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	811.6205350788431
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	2696.9676293781417
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	1523.0066519795096
They went under.	2295.443477364505
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	1035.005372367737
Loyal to a lost cause.	2490.2274275255013
He strode away from them towards the window.	1181.7803069329095
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	1136.4284686252413
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	1059.5360817773756
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	1759.5959650168002
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	2036.5525568772139
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	1986.352415997578
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	986.72054251316
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	1267.8050200058
Whose mother is beastly dead.	1309.452403020047
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	2612.6666403837503
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	430.97545468721114
I ’ ll read the rest after.	751.3795540414434
That ’ ll be all right.	889.0722362109881
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	806.097824737868
— But my riddle! he said.	800.0167734368943
What opera is like a railwayline?	676.3976212128373
— Opera?	476.8796238379752
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	2479.2662962577574
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	2087.664764888677
See the wheeze?	511.68833519870157
Rows of cast steel.	4719.5535493482785
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	2660.3790090138223
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	1462.3577221313826
— Help! he sighed.	2393.395390793321
I feel a strong weakness.	658.6033249827916
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	1603.8440149141381
— Paris, past and present, he said.	479.21844771810936
You look like communards.	4718.602848294283
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	1434.2810921941984
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	1281.2135439399756
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	720.7955354119682
You look as though you had done the deed.	1092.9107613435585
General Bobrikoff.	18812.731941147817
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	1849.046484430436
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	1330.6147825136752
Law, the classics...	11018.242763628195
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	740.6262090625166
— Literature, the press.	1345.0519396735542
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	584.1995616920552
The gentle art of advertisement.	2033.8512595250636
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	1052.3240880765966
The vocal muse.	9250.318667881298
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	1807.2761011900695
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	2642.218885470734
— Ahem! he said very softly.	1743.5519948192984
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	544.7746497492094
The gate was open.	1680.9151896393605
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	3307.9946807854003
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	423.09071708277287
Something with a bite in it.	810.9432280552902
You can do it.	1240.0604094964456
I see it in your face.	617.4476348964726
_In the lexicon of youth_...	16361.663738109995
See it in your face.	1014.5271736553109
See it in your eye.	1118.7214933364537
Lazy idle little schemer.	15535.477688537829
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	2284.2131700149603
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	7426.8931987204105
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	1348.1828203098978
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	1237.428031206568
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	1412.6390792911195
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	1585.6235258603467
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	1818.6773219197262
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	805.195958389502
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said.	1048.05373110003
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	2329.7975751022095
Wait a minute.	2234.4346584826367
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	1718.5803183883158
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	710.9116948257006
That was a pen.	1133.3630501486941
You know how he made his mark?	497.5376948447902
I ’ ll tell you.	725.042717917072
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	2739.9367188315487
I ’ ll show you.	804.8537512795558
He pushed past them to the files.	1365.17162885744
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	6930.1865353407775
Remember that time?	324.76012410362694
Professor MacHugh nodded.	7370.31345010839
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	1432.8945302719412
Where it took place.	1836.3808688183485
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	1141.5682563923506
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	742.6721104790871
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	1776.6031865095028
Whole route, see?	651.8386595636742
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	893.8120353829545
Fitzharris.	13137.782459902772
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	720.567510448251
Holohan told me.	4246.445313766371
You know Holohan?	774.3111962043398
— Hop and carry one, is it?	347.0018749554691
Myles Crawford said.	2843.7398906325457
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	797.5977264116024
A night watchman.	4167.82535407502
Stephen turned in surprise.	1681.732619919135
— Gumley?	257.34860208575407
he said.	856.4235297911396
You don ’ t say so?	351.39405548213733
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	3068.738237810966
Look at here.	2143.1118766804157
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	827.403386175372
I ’ ll tell you.	725.042717917072
Inspiration of genius.	5551.688134746553
Cabled right away.	7799.136436102905
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	815.0368509498923
Right.	5268.119875574054
Have you got that?	310.68523549007955
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	981.4951844926888
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	1371.7266507443264
Have you got that?	310.68523549007955
Right.	5268.119875574054
The telephone whirred.	6055.454615689039
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	669.9600406977816
— B is parkgate.	3132.74205799198
Good.	3917.763028917056
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	3581.516050967061
— T is viceregal lodge.	2617.361893882802
C is where murder took place.	2495.1456358127293
K is Knockmaroon gate.	8041.866419548904
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	1241.8899969608765
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	2539.7138772448793
— Hello?	230.75500922155783
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	22825.349937810017

Yes.	2997.8126705455184
— F to P is the route Skin - the - Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	1124.9078481592455
<URL>. Got that?	1239.9121490269258
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	1435.5435017948755
The professor came to the inner door.	1062.8367767909754
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	372.1274078583242
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	788.5757103672383
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	265.58186477560395
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	2298.8383525712
Very.	5184.158288979094
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	831.7074813007293
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	2764.2030919238664
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	728.6552438507595
I was present.	1126.9141502358214
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	1247.9109704407826
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	851.0421041776223
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	3416.0607486290965
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	2355.8033530727103
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	890.411393033382
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	1467.4942072536685
Out of an advertisement.	1871.5282707902106
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	2942.056532511492
That gave him the leg up.	992.8534954720238
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <URL> Now he ’ s got in with Blumenfeld.	1184.9765942105669
That ’ s press.	1100.2503799616788
That ’ s talent.	2198.1896515998374
Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	1290.4679552604462
— Hello?...	8352.19547412812
Are you there?...	5911.001268104461
Yes, he ’ s here still.	514.2738021569601
Come across yourself.	4508.33010790355
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	509.0272912025057
the editor cried.	1695.0101270336659
He flung the pages down.	1374.0515501295579
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	1710.159358310073
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	1058.3072757278132
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	2288.5929093849563
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	952.0904018678918
— O yes, J.	721.1325332179356
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	1491.1661985742235
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	1087.4583581531429
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin - the - Goat.	1305.7517223581247
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! — They ’ re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	925.6153669905955
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	1282.6647281877408
Eh?	290.7036277742018
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	2806.6361951824215
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	1703.542024217639
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	862.3011071876828
Why did you write it then?	420.2099758352302
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	10712.389780554116
Is the mouth south someway?	685.2234668566962
Or the south a mouth?	327.81694298949776
Must be some.	2009.1856064310725
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	1036.0721476814608

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, _per l ’ aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più <URL> But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.	1882.8868247531348

— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	1019.746232487396
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	1683.2240890430746
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	1516.1598116505152

Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	1591.137044445065
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	1917.869081567305
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE — Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.	3887.194168975806

Psha! — Well, J.	1298.319445262579
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said, Bushe <URL>., for example.	1245.4131031297586
— Bushe?	259.2037911880482
the editor said.	1011.365315799751
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	816.3268748961932
He has a strain of it in his blood.	545.3718694852682
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	4540.005145108366
— He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....	1378.8818323034184
But no matter.	2386.0292923377997
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	760.8748368655596
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	923.7581248405897
Bushe defended him.	6437.219161570718
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	704.0112387304522
He died in his sleep.	1054.4054053086995
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	659.0761988463657
— What was that?	135.7222894420698
the professor asked.	1268.4368299634068
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	1757.3774432061293
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	2019.786662842409
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	1526.590309281091
— Ha. — A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	4427.053768600309
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	1593.8248533472185
False lull.	39616.09131016968
Something quite ordinary.	6035.728193802095
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	3177.7578252391463
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	973.2843088286469
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	13188.279044154087
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	965.0699104559176
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	1504.5607018787355
— The divine afflatus, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	1350.8249462921394
— You like it?	176.2709036162213
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy asked Stephen.	1283.5803406556226
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	1360.9498971723956
He took a cigarette from the case.	848.5157454652958
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	1459.8295014019275
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: — Muchibus thankibus.	2493.268121501829
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	1761.6968128676
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	714.4354707197774
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	1662.2148047860953
E.	5027.68337428093
the mastermystic?	448.118240529955
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	1508.9656855939122
A.	2028.0615964047747
E.	5027.68337428093
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	1278.1744171788346
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	2983.0675290792524
E. ’ s leg.	3744.2431631599857
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	1067.785470860977
Speaking about me.	3544.859113745599
What did he say?	259.2787400679658
What did he say?	259.2787400679658
What did he say about me?	305.05543565881396
Don ’ t ask.	1645.739843363014
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	1019.1178659294582
Wait a moment.	1753.625653304385
Let me say one thing.	1639.894941627272
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	1321.9828742366165
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	1117.0553834677025
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	1311.3060512893958
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	1318.930151438742
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	1552.9318752937056
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	867.2871351291357
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	515.6854539177376
Go on.	2227.2151844377586
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	1099.550102004231
It was then a new movement.	1182.2974086193215
We were weak, therefore worthless.	3732.0201858706832
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	1325.8000844505505
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	8280.133308252372
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	671.879443089575
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	929.045685346103
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	1886.7506028991927
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	1114.1996021414534
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	1781.3104196880245
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	534.5727102850997
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	2984.29785537917
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	1284.2125589265747
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	834.718773202426
He raised his head firmly.	727.4013330971213
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	4717.284331811994
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	3365.392088073706
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	874.7676325585024
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	1067.9135228659409
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	6584.607714927185
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	630.4355338958213
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	716.2686824765776
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	1860.842560762119
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	1225.874147941149
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	865.9999164981541
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	2043.1636790852526
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	2683.5905886567807
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	1801.680528838067
Child, man, effigy.	2037.1414946086463
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	1896.3769303383253
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	1924.1589230572233
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	1224.4330187573928
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	3468.4762789985093
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	693.8067897851101
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	895.1935159394177
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	8686.097784990103
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	1038.7522756250187
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	996.3658034147388
And with a great future behind him.	1044.2797150047193
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	1917.521394760261
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	1477.678859367143
Gone with the wind.	1233.4167384310654
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	2601.942461434268
Miles of ears of porches.	3604.9624194680114
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	1485.8696547844718
A people sheltered within his voice.	3080.4570282610603
Dead noise.	6594.366736856531
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	3414.483570844638
Love and laud him: me no more.	1459.0555804896815
I have money.	1255.5405859809202
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	1002.2070709102927
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	1072.756445093709
— You take my breath away.	1521.5758357598274
It is not perchance a French compliment?	1124.8438006018416
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	1594.8915720812126
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	2043.6833713719557
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	2456.583294077792
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	1344.9736225749978
The contrary no.	2120.4904649570817
I declare it carried.	1820.2000244723904
To which particular boosing shed...?	13872.346329122209
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	1086.4088091797082
Yes, we will not.	844.4422608216353
By no manner of means.	2013.660947261117
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	842.3473596092595
Let us go.	2739.1544765474564
Where are those blasted keys?	1329.7633920516878
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	2393.6363371653933
— Foot and mouth.	1266.3199444390127
I know.	1189.6598921535906
That ’ ll be all right.	889.0722362109881
That ’ ll go in.	819.0505787992458
Where are they?	289.8327992084386
That ’ s all right.	702.7065965827944
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	1072.6400396798472
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	537.6931834228243
Myles, one moment.	1267.2835533740745
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	856.9298911418178
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	467.7103930927145
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	300.42241314899445
It has the prophetic vision.	2927.5906939835527
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	4892.528031159001
Kingdoms of this world.	3081.434585878658
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	2680.099240729254
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	1429.715407090894
I have much, much to learn.	736.5582754449234
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	1228.726755940678
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	489.2177629054324
— Yes?	157.4419951414339
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	1008.6336020313138
Crawford will follow.	4061.5606578807165
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	5461.894082674567
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	1345.7054333331791
— Where is that?	181.4589406340003
the professor asked.	1268.4368299634068
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	1535.406987242832
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	12192.412380482505
Against the wall.	2983.0770997364357
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	18258.360213218893
Frantic hearts.	18603.321514966345
Akasic records.	31362.37528359212
Quicker, darlint! On now.	3719.8752704839467
Dare it.	6298.85791733158
Let there be life.	1737.8859355717727
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	605.9191587600122
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	3490.214875198882
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	1395.7976742709377
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	966.7032116359803
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	1476.78519079825
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	2098.505751543153
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	6706.35743017605
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	664.3012442888535
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	941.4617447633511
Glory be to God.	2015.6290823118516
They had no idea it was that high.	910.3131645768905
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	4171.45663980427
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	2129.3071469509314
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	1182.6248515670627
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	1563.9842388788798
Vestal virgins.	18760.79186862416
I can see them.	1036.9775310078983
What ’ s keeping our friend?	445.5915176361042
He turned.	1813.1731650863921
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	2154.457919316882
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	1268.4111683753154
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy.	1357.664789283395
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	769.1944686045707
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	812.5189796737894
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	1342.6813075883906
I see them.	966.3802986430985
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	610.496473589625
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	1347.5626928207298
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	847.3872313619635
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	1358.820116347822
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	416.7928365889697
After he ’ ll see.	1009.8928926259207
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	569.742803299606
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	958.5403100206445
I can have access to it in the national library.	917.7117773328614
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	328.2390688376694
His name is Keyes.	2135.5881209958848
It ’ s a play on the name.	470.1260614733444
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	678.0329816205667
But he wants just a little puff.	1432.7181199856389
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	309.8062928833864

Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	2402.3781160230355
Tell him that straight from the stable.	1513.1104080069183
Look out for squalls.	4140.103816339316

Usual blarney.	31362.37528359212
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	1114.2955579285654
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	996.7458016650791
Been walking in muck somewhere.	8106.669725195297
What was he doing in Irishtown?	338.82349598308673
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	517.6709093095197
He ’ d give the ad, I think.	587.2842969827567
I ’ ll tell him...	3657.0451183369423
<URL>. — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	2338.704168887306
Any time he likes, tell him.	1121.6683250362385
RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	1749.479178023913
I ’ m up to here.	587.1197535997879
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	1581.0403835602217
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	829.7169453976223
Sorry, Jack.	2934.3956713265266
You must take the will for the deed.	835.8379325481075

O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	1078.8307557303945
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	1444.9039388644023
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	579.5585449069257
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	822.3485340170974
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	1003.8546643185604
SOME COLUMN! — THAT ’ S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID — That ’ s new, Myles Crawford said.	3980.4887482601707
That ’ s copy.	1142.9940807480957
Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	3099.131507968216
Two old trickies, what?	614.5038690508994
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	860.7689965856099
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	1591.0750960036248
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	9683.920966436926
No poetic licence.	9105.053152024593
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	1322.8938490775488
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	618.728779004059
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	2711.125972906426
I like that.	666.5387932443599
I see the idea.	777.0187284852489
I see what you mean.	997.0518484618981
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	2342.8899553065003
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	683.6796903683886
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	1525.5447812620823
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	845.1343422842164
— Finished?	691.3922142010439
Myles Crawford said.	2843.7398906325457
So long as they do no worse.	1573.76042754239
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	82940.96167887108
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	892.8933761362936
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	1178.3897164130394
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	620.6420992982436
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	971.7935555924415
Poor Penelope.	5912.715143950693

Where did they get the plums?	435.8806584185835

Call it, let me see.	917.6717241630786
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	3636.360045849678
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	1298.283994058556
He laughed richly.	4938.148316904032
— I see, he said again with new pleasure.	545.2832751055647

Well, of course, if we knew all the things.	500.0818558874481
Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls.	2489.2945017968154

Looking for grub.	6183.522801376767

He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball.	1961.0995898061378
Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com.	14293.279470490656
Not a bit.	1452.8078138849223

Not such damn fools.	6785.683843169724
Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin ’ s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern.	925.2817930203639

They wheeled, flapping.	673.709933920149
The hungry famished gull Flaps o ’ er the waters dull.	2937.3852833102696
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	1437.1342422731914
But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse.	3313.6075912668675

Those poor birds.	5127.8670184574485
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.	1729.4151340710416
See that?	208.93065882453556
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey.	1237.7619716888069

But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty?	1118.6686058507737
How is that?	182.14736146971924

Blurt out what I was thinking.	2055.9346437057216
Still, I don ’ t know.	643.1282863572603
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.	1712.9988301581946
He has legs like barrels and you ’ d think he was singing into a barrel.	1014.8344917310762
Now, isn ’ t that wit.	1035.0018986210018
They used to call him big Ben.	1577.9790853518195
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	2689.67755418964
Appetite like an albatross.	11074.122876649615
Get outside of a baron of beef.	1924.8429118591787
Barrel of Bass.	5580.698095958687
It all works out.	1698.2325280392004
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	3519.331564645028
Bargains.	21558.06072352106
Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	1262.8789099707462
He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H.	1644.1507431617615

Wisdom Hely ’ s.	1713.3895427968
Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	1893.5714255334005
Our staple food.	11209.411304500674
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	1095.8348373313017
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	2449.810740718218
Doesn ’ t bring in any business either.	1804.319936994367
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	1952.4432545396614
I bet that would have caught on.	1122.9684152150514
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	2833.6920368986307
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	1105.0473287813732
Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing.	1250.6111875529798
Women too.	3500.7201950914136
Curiosity.	15787.963800563719
Pillar of salt.	3761.485421728874
Wouldn ’ t have it of course because he didn ’ t think of it himself first.	614.1296235408532
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid.	2133.6107256765595
His ideas for ads like Plumtree ’ s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	1909.488887158785
You can ’ t lick ’ em.	1309.2073163944272
What?	122.71942533465327
Our envelopes.	5621.905578620555
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	362.27968611554826

Sister?	314.68059192676486
I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.	833.4296409445438
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	925.0703295254318
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	1947.384970558399
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	1931.0046295699055
Our great day, she said.	979.3971199150478
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.	4939.110280865485
Sweet name too: caramel.	4151.218435672726
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	533.456714718043
If she had married she would have changed.	1598.0402947774855
I suppose they really were short of money.	1258.2521539221104
Fried everything in the best butter all the same.	1356.8868294876518
No lard for them.	2575.547558054841
My heart ’ s broke eating dripping.	3155.2925687410107
They like buttering themselves in and out.	1565.7614330833758

As if that.	1474.1930727292945
Old Goodwin ’ s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	1877.7004345234282
Flies ’ picnic too.	4474.847536908191
Never put a dress on her back like it.	855.2047016151369

Just beginning to plump it out well.	1610.8622551817302
Rabbitpie we had that day.	2643.0222072541687

Well, if he couldn ’ t remember the dayfather ’ s name that he sees every day.	772.5785758359552
Bartell d ’ Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	1138.1679243138615
Seeing her home after practice.	3931.4194291257945
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	6294.39819083832
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	3336.462475053433
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin ’ s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	1456.8330546797308
He and I behind.	630.155695484419
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	1493.066482491058
Lucky it didn ’ t.	1833.219390427419
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	1036.1674529907418

She did get flushed in the wind.	1110.0040666393306
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	1449.4521790263373
And the mulled rum.	3535.5175129152335

— O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	216.6421610971328
— O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	310.9783105791643
— No use complaining.	4900.1108702077545
How is Molly those times?	599.8847663813722
Haven ’ t seen her for ages.	1774.5517038064577
— In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	683.0690850402065
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	892.0093421643675
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	452.79236739860846
— Yes.	1408.8980448614918
In a photographer ’ s there.	1208.7368124301745
Getting on like a house on fire.	1416.5411184156685
How are all your charges?	919.7539462420457
— All on the baker ’ s list, Mrs Breen said.	822.9204581138413
— You ’ re in black, I see.	464.9054882094866
You have no...	9497.512094754617

I have just come from a funeral.	927.4162971046227
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	1454.40250230897
Who ’ s dead, when and what did he die of?	247.13109874575068
Turn up like a bad penny.	1726.7604682076017
— O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	627.0294199125718
I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	776.3816827042821
May as well get her sympathy.	886.8818919124988
— Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	585.0087568021513
An old friend of mine.	1853.2701443245371
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	1676.8917841605783
Heart trouble, I believe.	1488.5781397325657
Funeral was this morning.	3125.5703497161985
Your funeral ’ s tomorrow While you ’ re coming through the rye.	1531.336560136043
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	129340.59236081725
— Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen ’ s womaneyes said melancholily.	1556.4176979980796
Now that ’ s quite enough about that.	853.0815486173514
Just: quietly: husband.	1875.7213139105124
— And your lord and master?	357.37253174671014
Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	2434.255609121267
— O, don ’ t be talking! she said.	511.44778283227197
He ’ s a caution to rattlesnakes.	1239.0022064467291
He ’ s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	987.2139091065635
He has me heartscalded.	3314.178666979791
Wait till I show you.	1568.3147499365218
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison ’ s.	6479.105018511578
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom ’ s gullet.	1591.8243298463294
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they ’ d taste it with the hot tea.	614.8642187777817
Or is it from her?	226.55523453971358
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	1127.248882270484
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	3819.030680178942
Pleasure or pain is it?	729.0188468143376

Pastille that was fell.	3323.63038529162
What is she?...	4593.467217767867
— There must be a new moon out, she said.	645.98368339377
He ’ s always bad then.	861.409381767968
Do you know what he did last night?	465.26276322569646
Her hand ceased to rummage.	3824.309197498454
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	786.1244623317034
— What?	128.22159737738772
Mr Bloom asked.	1465.5393185173311
Let her speak.	2436.2433835888196
Look straight in her eyes.	1482.3123481933042
I believe you.	1102.5009203015131
Trust me.	6203.095198607179

Dream he had, a nightmare.	1462.1710210895621
Indiges.	21558.06072352106
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	1319.8310948469614
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	950.3257340970316
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	2335.168774848766
— Read that, she said.	565.537928354909
He got it this morning.	1208.6128036920952

p: up, she said.	628.766989172034
Someone taking a rise out of him.	1123.3006865158227
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	724.0743311511131
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	652.5177723355482
She took back the card, sighing.	1061.7811936629153
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	547.7869057200675
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	765.65290767557
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	1655.1720272009597
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	3095.6200187156915

Shabby genteel.	50041.95876441744
She used to be a tasty dresser.	830.2505634005022
Lines round her mouth.	3837.1204524868826
Only a year or so older than Molly.	1953.5120720397283
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	812.5057599938937
Cruel.	11695.605131062071

I ’ m sorry to hear that.	772.0502210917613
— Yes, Mrs Breen said.	903.535267626519
And a houseful of kids at home.	2214.516571125059
It ’ s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.	714.0742232756382
— O, Mr Bloom said.	464.0037232742824
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	8946.935487232138
His tongue clacked in compassion.	5115.037598535964
Dth! Dth! — I ’ m sorry to hear that, he said.	762.3178489119042
Poor thing! Three days! That ’ s terrible for her.	998.0246578894044
Mrs Breen nodded.	5047.766105048593
— She was taken bad on the Tuesday...	2991.76618863864
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: — Mind! Let this man pass.	1053.2107000915607
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	1434.133061293463
Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head.	2321.384787183224
— Watch him, Mr Bloom said.	596.3668542860881
He always walks outside the lampposts.	2940.275531872671
Watch! — Who is he if it ’ s a fair question?	354.3061257609703
Mrs Breen asked.	3489.527007125548
Is he dotty?	767.7211565386989
— His name is Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling.	1505.1850650314225

Denis will be like that one of these days.	1047.9226802652968
She broke off suddenly.	3117.815155116805

Remember me to Molly, won ’ t you?	312.757037064978
— I will, Mr Bloom said.	424.47284241912854
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts.	3977.0318776871813
Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison ’ s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs.	3678.0768753741827
Blown in from the bay.	1580.64547082002
Like old times.	3040.45577925089
He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.	1616.6229180572273
Meshuggah.	15787.963800563719
Off his chump.	6749.342215254902

The sky.	2686.712393329104
Green by Drumleck.	7811.166916339562
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	23114.739417730885
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	2265.9855294233666
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	1089.4913290383115
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	1559.62674997569
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	1420.1272283939456
Yum.	21558.06072352106
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.	906.7029791901122

No - one.	1753.705768886597
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	15123.491799684367
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	959.8113261451596
Hot I tongued her.	3791.728994114252
She kissed me.	2219.9822579029837
All yielding she tossed my hair.	3599.842288310912

Bend down let something fall see if she.	2802.348943157053
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	1109.1893397195574
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	610.3674786715626
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	499.1809448520071
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	337.03532870391257
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	515.4999524852553
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	733.8983015854996
Is he in trouble?	294.37208594379945
— Trouble?	547.3458226899966
Nosey Flynn said.	3071.762045259724
Not that I heard of.	702.4860987828945
Why?	190.44911106412906
— Was he?	196.48613066448297
Nosey Flynn said.	3071.762045259724
So he was, faith.	787.1161912842593
I asked him how was all at home.	767.2137205942664
You ’ re right, by God.	719.6597286043078
So he was.	991.3933840023075
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	894.189300311527
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	1489.3803044764845
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	640.4179762816074
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	672.1507798636273
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	872.737658142324
Plovers on toast.	7301.80386258786
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	823.8765017741839
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	5886.340490978027
You can make bacon of that.	1170.119742953108
— How so?	221.87032038241685
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	1333.3674786389006
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	2494.555636306023
He winked.	2665.0323917161977
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	338.2747141050183
— Do you tell me so?	334.88621244665586
Davy Byrne said.	3179.640538489919
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	1259.435782742411
Ancient free and accepted order.	5728.566427157831
He ’ s an excellent brother.	1061.2258500828293
Light, life and love, by God.	620.3673286891038
They give him a leg up.	1127.3374370273448
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	414.3027836994425
— Is that a fact?	247.7815882451579
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	501.6657073175948
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	779.3709076500579
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	1068.6608800558204
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	681.5323829480644
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	1013.0223735200459
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	987.7309946740709
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	1660.10509824922
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	670.256481638098
Decent quiet man he is.	653.0081291568849
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	501.5394583248186
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	619.2495051103361
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	3164.0688608523496
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	407.98026569352146
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	963.7024481699768
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	959.3332347122785
Declare to God he does.	1904.065926303203
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	833.7411440545843
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	383.8698769364856
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	635.8694094332027
Give the devil his due.	1555.5418791511183
O, Bloom has his good points.	809.4937181096518
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	621.740088293904
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	2361.4269163998256
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	795.2963890405061
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	874.8621298922421
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	2144.4669420276296
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	2351.352046237781
— Day, Mr Byrne.	1144.203376105606
— Day, gentlemen.	1326.1653764543646
They paused at the counter.	2067.792914587326
— Who ’ s standing?	243.66378967090924
Paddy Leonard asked.	4725.836178923854
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	1218.2029983474558
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	204.0630876974242
Paddy Leonard asked.	4725.836178923854
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	915.826464003993
— How much?	277.4429793918168
Paddy Leonard cried.	5510.231977576962
Since when, for God ’ sake?	450.41126685676977
What ’ s yours, Tom?	271.8032258232986
— How is the main drainage?	672.4693870724105
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	3384.480431007384
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	1426.294458451371
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	462.2794272700411
he said.	856.4235297911396
— Certainly, sir.	1000.4476587737099
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	7302.507764174093
— Lord love a duck, he said.	638.2419500298186
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	1625.4281053954337
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	1251.9253752738553
A dead snip.	6860.664156006101
— Zinfandel is it?	337.6357256729335
Nosey Flynn asked.	4415.303804623553
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	2536.2431768216657
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	902.3133388019271
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	1714.992596404448
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	3468.953260177883
— Is it Zinfandel?	526.4889037506665
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	3041.3820751060216
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	1368.6217844167852
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	894.8636576500716
Who gave it to you?	230.3363188034764
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	1090.4005666082292
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	1509.5000759939485
The others turned.	2237.4441790954124
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	2592.084752358763
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	1370.5237463689386
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	5871.492934910159
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	1295.463425923446
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	1022.7132455149306
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	957.9570203529306
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	3993.794554031255
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	1995.4806953356099
Surfeit.	21558.06072352106
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	7375.215234977794
First sweet then savoury.	6095.084686532393
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	6745.767780269813
Ruminants.	21558.06072352106
Their upper jaw they move.	4951.027756538121
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	678.2630162938729
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn ’ s mouth.	1643.886154385189
Lean people long mouths.	2521.3125638030347
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	1250.703364700624
Course then you ’ d have all the cranks pestering.	2002.9259793132803
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M ’ invitasti.	1782.9982742102304
Feel better.	4969.623516280175
Burgundy.	13137.782459902772
Good pick me up.	2172.023038813041

Some chap in the blues.	2657.31812338548
Dutch courage.	12941.565531056425
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	2251.4305732981243
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	2265.219750917125
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	1720.0894511990252
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	899.3429503159522
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	1817.0447291104408
Tonight perhaps.	11580.0295922971
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	2542.3293179397915
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	1349.3484259453558

If I get Billy Prescott ’ s ad: two fifteen.	2060.4911676656657
Five guineas about.	4295.93024931969
On the pig ’ s back.	802.0909289628652
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	1330.5411581002056
Today.	648.4142163114785
Not think.	3225.272036645913
Tour the south then.	3512.3604169488813
What about English wateringplaces?	1375.2684201790998
Brighton, Margate.	6095.709619595144
Piers by moonlight.	8129.093889127257
Her voice floating out.	2815.3885637740595
Those lovely seaside girls.	5960.348794871806
Against John Long ’ s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	4925.993175629908
Handy man wants job.	7061.940335304679
Small wages.	34515.85074510494
Will eat anything.	4847.831844102254
Mr Bloom turned at Gray ’ s confectioner ’ s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan ’ s bookstore.	2329.1148217809473
_Why I left the church of Rome?	601.5930253887972
Birds ’ <URL> Women run him.	2616.5921292043795
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	624.8088020424566
Same bait.	14388.582252198721
No tram in sight.	2236.2683711383743
Wants to cross.	703.3570357579237
— Do you want to cross?	377.73289466512813
Mr Bloom asked.	1465.5393185173311
The blind stripling did not answer.	2344.1491747121636
His wallface frowned weakly.	16845.63669304584
He moved his head uncertainly.	1803.4792438768616
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	580.3215221601333
Molesworth street is opposite.	4603.5962615934395
Do you want to cross?	432.5669955740526
There ’ s nothing in the way.	519.6307718769539
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	1219.0278282430281
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	1137.9360252369704
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	1272.1335913658265
Horse drooping.	11602.304074895526
Driver in John Long ’ s.	1845.6872379582196
Slaking his drouth.	6749.980899721604
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	376.76149067113215
I ’ ll see you across.	817.0831015864321
— Yes, the stripling answered.	768.2254100410745
South Frederick street.	4876.265128195653
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	572.4907364606872
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	987.217714050805
Say something to him.	1316.3221983118628
Better not do the condescending.	2564.444467651065
They mistrust what you tell them.	2615.889121544358
Pass a common remark.	4638.188261223268
— The rain kept off.	1787.6510960989067
No answer.	3332.0431734872955
Stains on his coat.	3441.1738608049204
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	1731.5975542082688
Tastes all different for him.	2103.097547429869
Have to be spoonfed first.	3044.1819471394256
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	520.5291394927608
Like Milly ’ s was.	987.0029388818234
Sensitive.	15787.963800563719
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	2257.846995784293
Wonder if he has a name.	1019.8572725963488
Van.	15787.963800563719
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	1667.669624885257
That ’ s right.	809.8389813194009
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	821.0016665451212
— Thanks, sir.	963.0346606669241
Knows I ’ m a man.	800.618138792071
Voice.	21558.06072352106
— Right now?	312.9208670620723
First turn to the left.	1137.3602133951458
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	941.9791919081869
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	2600.6474042120017
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	623.9375118899419
Must have felt it.	1758.6810154724237
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	1302.6866924194258
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	1538.5464144290331
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	1307.420889342524
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	848.1022281246522
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	640.6124466520008
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	1228.0191680578773
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	446.28294068753183
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	905.4969304976873
Read with their fingers.	2036.5297238492826
Tune pianos.	39616.09131016968
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	2243.778066256729
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	2128.5111934646898
Of course the other senses are more.	1547.8242818710662
Embroider.	21558.06072352106
Plait baskets.	39616.09131016968
People ought to help.	2871.8131022419598
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	1886.1369494366154
Hates sewing.	50041.95876441744
Might take an objection.	5606.893406779928
Dark men they call them.	2250.9204690596544
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	4732.097707722139
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	3478.6196454139726
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	757.0235203055386
Tastes?	707.147630662528
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	1002.4897748017048
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	1379.2575426366282
And with a woman, for instance.	564.5353454972455
More shameless not seeing.	8382.098797302002
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	1248.711520489053
Look at me.	1629.209593410893
I have them all on.	593.2586630715986
Must be strange not to see her.	1061.0556146227193
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	594.8195485449703
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	856.5695373415709
His hands on her hair, for instance.	839.842920559294
Say it was black, for instance.	901.4264114484151
Good.	3917.763028917056
We call it black.	1840.2605544481696
Then passing over her white skin.	2192.710742821967
Different feel perhaps.	8123.350325731024
Feeling of white.	3258.7449685701317
Postoffice.	13137.782459902772
Fag today.	14627.575416550682
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	1576.1748127557025
Accept my little present.	4923.191979253321
Stationer ’ s just here too.	1956.8239583454886
Wait.	4301.167531310137
Think over it.	1902.6794544774589
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	1913.4876443856172
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	1244.2238535042477
Downy hair there too.	4809.276608255414
Not smooth enough.	4833.903793772336
The belly is the smoothest.	1840.8973842024818
No - one about.	1488.6507544716158
There he goes into Frederick street.	2072.2686186694364
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	3700.216180815127
Might be settling my braces.	6605.32138528813
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	1112.5977833850773
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	1317.1371180728001
Want to try in the dark to see.	696.5149371653587
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	1089.0357634534448
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	1826.4730405910923
Terrible.	5659.915422629268
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	397.9290547486803
Life a dream for him.	1281.7530212444642
Where is the justice being born that way?	489.6401922096275
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	3759.675268960013
Holocaust.	21558.06072352106
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	2057.494572376253
Dear, dear, dear.	1087.099671607317
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	845.8786853936542
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	3741.7279100853666
Solemn as Troy.	6880.510982846182
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	3579.374569189469
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	4011.825841886554
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	2314.708981815942
I sentenced him to ten years.	1991.6062382501307
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	834.6419619762619
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	1485.0928179552207
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	928.377682449816
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	7674.597757119712
Sends them to the rightabout.	3028.0264717145246
The devil on moneylenders.	4030.7897302624174
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	6578.609574533321
Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	1063.6296365705941
Power those judges have.	4047.1513287559533
Crusty old topers in wigs.	11064.292633511526
Bear with a sore paw.	1229.871046682111
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	1282.0899125100002
Hello, placard.	4408.4704115432505
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	896.8093165552746
Sixteenth.	21558.06072352106
Today it is.	406.27696338538175
In aid of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital.	2101.932844009619
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	2147.536033074774
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
Handel.	15787.963800563719
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	1562.3141088900304
No use sticking to him like a leech.	1723.1609701324417
Wear out my welcome.	5241.340533905135
Sure to know someone on the gate.	1174.3886485696398
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	1265.218983120336
First I must.	2030.9296200969732
Library.	11695.605131062071
Straw hat in sunlight.	5108.023674896884
Tan shoes.	14207.64879072596
Turnedup trousers.	15742.062689140876
It is.	1477.0299770974034
It is.	1477.0299770974034
His heart quopped softly.	8271.926981511115
To the right.	1059.7740550272715
Museum.	15787.963800563719
Goddesses.	21558.06072352106
He swerved to the right.	1038.669822881365
Is it?	195.37583545712073
Almost certain.	5748.379611334881
Wine in my face.	1447.898196498075
Why did I?	240.947310428936
Too heady.	16984.84587213627
Yes, it is.	534.8439888170233
The walk.	2200.295283506293
Not see.	2535.795635427075
Get on.	2200.9351416502986
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	1937.4126592862463
Handsome building.	2492.876193676141
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	19833.548392929195
Not following me?	479.60137694478317
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	1370.068185312081
Light in his eyes.	1097.9147331337088
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	1433.9526341322396
Quick.	5846.311267724853
Cold statues: quiet there.	2805.486094202979
Safe in a minute.	1466.4482155541282
No. Didn ’ t see me.	2483.650132245254
After two.	3078.573538669602
Just at the gate.	1324.3329012969275
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	2901.144213140162
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	6075.231994977805
Look for something I.	1310.5063265121394
Where did I?	239.77264440686326
Busy looking.	13244.174292986947
He thrust back quick Agendath.	3266.7133428071998
Afternoon she said.	3421.9474586781894
I am looking for that.	853.6557851299008
Yes, that.	604.5928164784308
Try all pockets.	3472.172426125219
Handker.	21558.06072352106
Trousers.	648.4142163114785
Potato.	13137.782459902772
Purse.	21558.06072352106
Where?	188.90416504930744
Hurry.	5659.915422629268
Walk quietly.	6404.645079873457
Moment more.	8224.247705627815
My heart.	3378.29704146231
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	1018.3507345142436
Ah soap there I yes.	1901.0606366283776
Gate.	13137.782459902772
Safe! Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred: — And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	1544.2446421625853
A great poet on a great brother poet.	1749.9471151070268
A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.	1965.5028961574287
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	1370.5747071851526
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.	3155.1336465548097
— Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.	1225.3629310720332

He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	662.6694971672994
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	1664.7222335197978
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	1728.6752793272349
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	513.8811308073383

France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer ’ s Phæacians.	1434.2514336727193
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	2309.293746820024
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	1207.3717999327623
The one about <URL> He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui - même_, don ’ t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	3315.680860367152

_Hamlet ou_...	100022.11576482824
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	1378.574235899201
John Eglinton laughed.	4196.993787718541
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	354.29816489834326
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	1528.0585853780567
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	7949.230549319737
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	673.431206989489
Not for nothing was he a butcher ’ s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	884.0342034665409

— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	885.9907777931193
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	2331.67010144409
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	3894.064206625384
If thou didst ever...	25015.408084850136
— What is a ghost?	233.7761484735931
Stephen said with tingling energy.	971.3250617350245
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	1900.73190383744
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	5209.288007224898

John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	2184.45541553313

— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	1500.8994713015447
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	1873.4193264928422

A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	1105.6746805569906
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	603.6847371755947
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	884.7436511137107
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	594.3778358736048
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	774.5096530596456
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	1298.6965358453208
Art thou there, truepenny?	1410.8710105331447
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	2194.2745601308898
I mean, we have the plays.	681.9644788432704
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	689.6054078633197
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	1194.564786158678
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	1145.8784673063897
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	1469.1992690849077

John Eglinton ’ s carping voice asked.	2301.0302173572104
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	2106.833644097333
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	842.3156234694976
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	1336.4376867888618
She saw him into and out of the world.	488.6650027929965
She took his first embraces.	716.5927915129547
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	1093.1268607370703

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	830.2514340496228
— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	509.18362025642665
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	2283.4392866185894
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	2566.390455058792
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	1272.4178042675776
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	1523.1425335682873
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	1027.9357476084328
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	649.1187804494836
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	852.0028287345042
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	1222.1458321666
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	2511.7567469271307
Mr Best ’ s quiet voice said forgetfully.	2078.3215724272604
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	1090.5121367477384
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	2216.153708022613
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	849.6490246435195
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	1310.2138411250428
That memory, _Venus and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light - of - love in London.	1214.1873572730185

If others have their will Ann hath a way.	1838.5328899999097
By cock, she was to blame.	985.127764064856
She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix.	1387.7540276346792
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	2828.9711529467954
And my turn?	321.35738790622446

Come! — Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	1479.9504985598724
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	1865.0790424531947

— They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest.	768.2315023680334
Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses.	1100.5073938477935
We are all looking forward anxiously.	3255.3082667405033
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	1765.2390249052705
See this.	2964.352961840748

Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	2082.6264303617195
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	1887.3484729454078
Did you hear Miss Mitchell ’ s joke about Moore and Martyn?	1445.7730585570905
That Moore is Martyn ’ s wild oats?	557.3008211239389
Awfully clever, isn ’ t it?	673.9775810475468

— Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	647.3597885800546
— O, yes.	630.7725082824606
If he considers it important it will go in.	1579.0340789258019
We have so much correspondence.	3432.6137378681533

Stephen sat down.	2276.7176568384216
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	2660.2250029326656
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	1592.8596602653404
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	455.6917105691913
Alarmed face asks me.	1820.4521214789827
Why did he come?	338.17530100825593
Courtesy or an inward light?	1425.2492679562758
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	804.4963532550113
— Yes.	1408.8980448614918
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	3917.199836930519
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters ’ wives.	1309.0824254870072
Fox and geese.	4807.006898058632
And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	1318.4530565098921
— Yes.	1408.8980448614918
So you think...	11316.192818595442
The door closed behind the outgoer.	2786.1918697267606
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	4303.9435968596445
A vestal ’ s lamp.	2388.4638171412325
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	953.1334347322958
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	2643.50843667437
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	2837.901490162469
And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest.	1038.5085477310554
_In painted chambers loaded with <URL> They are still.	2135.8886232163177
Once quick in the brains of men.	1119.175285966109
Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	1043.2512410817817
— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	868.9952774088188
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	1224.838786935266
Not even so much.	2368.814761163849
Others abide our question.	14441.317886466824
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	1415.5788623441483
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	430.7622875642883
Mr Best pleaded.	5936.341032648256
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	438.691396830785
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	946.8504039943914
His private papers in the original.	1549.3570128620652
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	13080.821877995546
Taim in mo shagart_.	20083.876403771745
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	3395.178009665932
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	1441.1986240791207
Bear with me.	2630.4321626700175
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	3189.649908179862
A basilisk.	6729.382459240637
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	21930.53423844312
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	2503.358211229782
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	1041.0096700377658
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	626.4712920836189
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	562.9089945692253
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	550.8669335449989
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	4814.406263980473
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	1542.0115983489652
I feel Hamlet quite young.	2383.376793964874
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	818.5032636373411
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	2993.455790641826
He is in my father.	698.6659770661753
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	318.9926984573294
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	6144.7349455229905
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	700.6550010174775
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	2312.838564846178
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	1347.9275191099323
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	909.163271276178
Said that.	3869.3981871939686
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	912.6256179590769
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	1309.274700351369
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	3845.763539702058
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	635.0954330961306
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	2297.84702597342
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	2394.9619969411247
Good Bacon: gone musty.	7948.864973083342
Shakespeare Bacon ’ s wild oats.	1389.1130794156315
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	6919.4100419702945

Mummed in names: A.	2413.9354831668397
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n - og_.	922.5222819493775
Booted the twain and staved.	8000.4114688871505
How many miles to Dublin?	663.7862311130918
Three score and ten, sir.	1357.2930911186204
Will we be there by candlelight?	965.2737242373007
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	828.3113645127237
— Does he?	219.80442524531773
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	991.7005919844299
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	624.5164457756819
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	643.3318379075068
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	996.2500186452396
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	1249.9121741691306
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	21095.671545413465
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	479.26135007864224
Do you know what you are talking about?	479.7202999818579
Such an appeal will touch him.	2650.1015031152556
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	1466.2269759052554
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	4790.714108725241
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	831.4361902962214
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	3482.360876059648
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	1271.58121455962
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	3629.7001243753166
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	831.470670770462
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	2229.296493126403
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	1173.148999561349
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	5146.79633043414
Dost love, Miriam?	765.1998009626901
Dost love thy man?	1276.9083356736112
— That may be too, Stephen said.	670.4283206516857
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	885.0359436320674
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	766.8673305690406
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	1280.314383490555
Why?	190.44911106412906
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	1145.705804395397
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	6225.461767204782
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	966.2233361300372
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	3740.638144476259
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	1803.2276665942802
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	702.4740199429542
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	1787.5468030413836
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	958.0846642461058
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	1395.2896445861675
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	1374.738200870034
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	1310.1420559058945
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	1036.0333221251742
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	1346.6895251799829
His beaver is up.	2869.3580358710274
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	382.79051839046775
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	515.3613762931608
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	1211.520610741734
_Entr ’ acte_.	13741.820511202666
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	1102.8930477130432
My telegram.	4713.511695400482
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	744.1359045983127
he asked of Stephen.	682.0898821625915
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	1914.8927663063364
They make him welcome.	2200.0248344800007
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	20922.035446524227
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	1857.813260041854
He lifts his hands.	1528.1206025238166
Veils fall.	16270.68850963357
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	2739.772454200711
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	692.407046490688
A most instructive discussion.	3822.6389722723598
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	456.1890489339987
All sides of life should be represented.	2537.446151978323
He smiled on all sides equally.	1896.2175907163723
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	661.8147703443509
he said.	856.4235297911396
I seem to know the name.	723.0010231742001
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	4955.877355198995
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	487.7698425184187
The chap that writes like Synge.	2010.2504879054443
Mr Best turned to him.	1110.3978559118211
— Haines missed you, he said.	643.4317806381528
Did you meet him?	390.8040939274172
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	613.7959185367712
B.	4668.207229408097
C.	3903.316026160732
He ’ s gone to Gill ’ s to buy Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	1338.2395417822331
— I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	667.7151908619797
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	1735.927233751123
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	1382.7445368827441
Has no - one made him out to be an Irishman?	560.7126517619233
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	2303.7986421611367
— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	709.9531743372602
<URL> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	937.6292659034444
— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	482.22581276283773
the quaker librarian asked.	2187.8779604718497
Or Hughie Wills?	4397.333380715931
Mr William Himself.	3674.2149149096917
W.	4990.896473038367
H.: who am I?	941.7546356729864
— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	1385.5244589347526
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	645.6067397818445
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	587.1740135390089
The light touch.	2506.5352997152186
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	2228.0699643393223
Tame essence of Wilde.	9026.754519761058
You ’ re darned witty.	3452.9978840133244
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy ’ s ducats.	3683.0219746516127
How much did I spend?	555.6151461839961
O, a few shillings.	837.569794386861
For a plump of pressmen.	2576.8485608111814
Humour wet and dry.	5128.933636369873
Wit.	21558.06072352106
You would give your five wits for youth ’ s proud livery he pranks in.	1207.4528100432528
Lineaments of gratified desire.	11976.897634966064
Take her for me.	1138.7353832520548
In pairing time.	5496.857098335048
Jove, a cool ruttime send them.	1301.8550787670192
Yea, turtledove her.	4706.752710478352
Eve.	5846.311267724853
Naked wheatbellied sin.	26457.211347321336
A snake coils her, fang in ’ s kiss.	1707.7295129269132
— Do you think it is only a paradox?	482.41457945837277
the quaker librarian was asking.	1893.5736445781934
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	1307.3462098931516
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	3365.2613812537707
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	1814.342038355475
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	741.5486402563362
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	2596.8991889099743
— Telegram! he said.	1136.3720861691088
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	2030.9848802890149
Where did you launch it from?	607.0252195882598
The kips?	654.4148417437589
No. College Green.	11728.472653668383
Have you drunk the four quid?	637.299681501839
Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	2153.197114135195
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	879.3841843783676
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	1745.1991961649805
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	1775.5165708878087
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	1464.7702982252283
Stephen laughed.	2938.475600967057
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	3504.021105292177
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	630.6076150313357
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	2106.685079300443
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	833.9300943047366
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	1717.0752627913228
That was your contribution to literature.	2162.646778421908
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	2807.363964136304
— Murder you! he laughed.	1299.0060953295817
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	6973.221953710655
In words of words for words, palabras.	1488.335919065303
Oisin with Patrick.	6544.733499992829
Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle.	6703.648794688188
_C ’ est vendredi saint! _ Murthering Irish.	7309.389607201405
His image, wandering, he met.	961.6377135091406
I mine.	1845.9687950501004
I met a fool i ’ the forest.	1045.74887669154
— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	1088.3431017878506
—...	18788.198812957176
in which everyone can find his own.	1353.8506301208524
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	5318.414271122273
Yes?	161.35874784168553
What is it?	149.64377956376987
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	472.5138008950831
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	1193.3410829911231
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	1018.9611748168152
Is the gentleman?...	5490.22288727865
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	764.9219378477198
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	716.9365635740403
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	2109.4337120803157
— This gentleman?	359.39272137067104
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	1737.9307303892676
Good day, sir.	1187.9951242686757
_Kilkenny_...	100038.18749644158
We have certainly...	14841.968094788883
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	4435.252455083848
— All the leading provincial...	6301.145439838608
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, _ <NUM>...	11777.70290846628

This way...	21356.47981907228
Please, sir...	9487.321222254683
The door closed.	2501.725785466028
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	2125.7241085056753
He jumped up and snatched the card.	1463.651843529032
— What ’ s his name?	163.000856484672
Bloom.	1994.4318862221655
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	1268.642839267395
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	1320.8720888044231
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	1719.9721578398166
Every day we must do homage to her.	818.9762008141968
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	1033.860280878992
He knows your old fellow.	1608.8210014206554
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	742.0809723258934
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	7341.51349338481
Venus Kallipyge.	18603.321514966345
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	837.7266627097962
— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	788.4477212570885
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	765.939203408869
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	1001.7598224589785
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	1186.5875358244089
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	761.6424265876874
His life was rich.	1883.3045496956445
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	1614.8127296299735
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	3434.9345742139917
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	1237.021439120431
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	7271.889779030931
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	2066.3579826318232
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	1495.8079825553132
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	1033.3105122002405
Cours la Reine.	28724.591581739784
_Encore vingt sous.	68801.66134699305
Minette?	1160.373267622947
Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	2761.0089958706785
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	1893.20895805965
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	1703.1981423656111
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	2859.4985981323753
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	1176.087944622437
Do and do.	1234.74185868418
Thing done.	9863.939922951387
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	1923.059170690984
An azured harebell like her veins.	8807.846271211529
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	1660.671176019924
He walks.	2686.898239501437
One life is all.	1402.8330245033753
One body.	3894.4250134377553
Do. But do.	6446.362320611227
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	1490.404668589455
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	1714.4061391011198
— Whom do you suspect?	313.19389873515195
he challenged.	4035.6665568328835
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	252.01523708581672
Once spurned twice spurned.	853.9616075232788
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	869.933630968333
Love that dare not speak its name.	2157.591644759905
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	858.4881982439771
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	9527.619741581795
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	841.8311542705072
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	356.5313035873836
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	1708.584301743539
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	1009.8907436095138
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	588.2484041571123
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	2637.963026162985
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	1508.1835170352688
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	392.2923822961941
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	942.6390094323375
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	734.998389084572
O, yes, mention there is.	627.4025858957405
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	1044.5257641134817
Explain you then.	3041.0529889342356
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	2646.776170280605
He faced their silence.	3490.039987617
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	2043.516189042021
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	1161.0104128849075
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	3808.07461809099
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	1074.7847340879573
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	74566.40286230473
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	1644.3682985312282
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	856.0518321843535
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	673.4870058741786
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	1056.0839928730832
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	2672.4294453790444
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	7537.352259302924
Let me think.	2282.4623159818702
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	1587.5131244516056
— Do you mean he died so?	435.8222175660337
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	3372.4743381118647
I mean...	14131.800474347649
— He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	2123.2200470446855
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	961.8719482160413
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! — What?	398.96222965702935
asked Besteglinton.	11528.111656713188
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	1690.374425777074
The people ’ s William.	1061.8863029183037
Dowden, Highfield house...	22289.020177123406
— Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	6278.096903853593
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	910.7154477169921
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those <URL> Lovely! Catamite.	1389.300085692774
— The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	2693.845314010391
Steadfast John replied severe: — The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	2528.1794761804244
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	1500.1420761495638
Sayest thou so?	1442.5555642213583
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	419.87354979987714
— And the sense of property, Stephen said.	519.1306842271799
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	1522.9984596973197
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	2495.1273162983853
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	3955.7886300585637
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	1290.987071856275
How else could Aubrey ’ s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	2104.8338449949197
All events brought grist to his mill.	4470.947945583872
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	1457.3272649224662
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love ’ s Labour Lost_.	4098.494898973661
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	3732.370448891057
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter ’ s theory of equivocation.	2239.167254100654
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	3228.5479871953426
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’ s.	2006.0174621152476
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	4761.9090435926455
I think you ’ re getting on very nicely.	1114.5775745747997
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	4805.933036855737
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, <URL> — Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	1765.771365912155
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	1962.742018821241
_Sufflaminandus <URL> — He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	1769.253737643215
— A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	1707.6698327441502
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	11196.494423205433
_Amplius.	15787.963800563719
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter <URL> — Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	24276.55153013881
— _Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	2364.5033022272964
There he keened a wailing rune.	6527.616358234284
— _Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! _ It ’ s destroyed we are from this day! It ’ s destroyed we are surely! All smiled their smiles.	2122.1449288821077
— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	1247.9203962865085
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	1098.7737969899536
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	2342.948405587485
Accusations are made in anger.	5155.81294369784
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	1246.9719296766107
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	7719.302629399687
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.	1257.601032334811
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	3319.734631102873
— Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	2998.089821258761
— Which will?	325.11004332035645
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	7357.790958682405
We are getting mixed.	3262.026799064971
— The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will ’ s widow, is the will to die.	635.3899366821581

The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	1707.663753025881
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare ’ s reverence, the angel of the world.	660.3209774238717

— Why?	178.2831959412683
Stephen answered himself.	2400.675709593371
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	602.5217340393051
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	2184.305260627065
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	837.6811884081711
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	751.5957370599018
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	1083.1169891912245

An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	990.6215786195817

Age has not withered it.	5769.122020038616
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	731.1406863579472
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	1006.3394932029016

Judge Eglinton summed up.	11999.108481794465
— The truth is midway, he affirmed.	730.0574004936609
He is the ghost and the prince.	529.8470624468879

O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	2941.3318146128754
— And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	2436.949367724081
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?) _ is right.	1907.1212636063206
After God Shakespeare has created most.	3618.098983667009
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	740.2631269399449
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	581.2750161070218

If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa ’ s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	1231.649882972684

The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	1014.6262733486867
_ — Eureka! _ Buck Mulligan cried.	1647.9721080254822
_Eureka! _ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton ’ s desk.	2223.539382892872
— May I?	202.0728905923265
he said.	856.4235297911396
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	1905.261180219402
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	1305.3670121930047
Take some slips from the counter going out.	841.0943544555524
— Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live.	1070.5167705849963
The rest shall keep as they are.	1581.8474153762165
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	1453.3343232238717
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of _The Taming of the <URL> — You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	2490.3321929093386
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	1507.423919470018
Do you believe your own theory?	797.0244455448319
— No, Stephen said promptly.	796.2485302847873
— Are you going to write it?	326.5765279948853
Mr Best asked.	2468.9398869778033
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	1195.3134138180455
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	15857.494347648908
— Well, in that case, he said, I don ’ t see why you should expect payment for it since you don ’ t believe it yourself.	556.4248380346315
Dowden believes there is some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	2391.3590140135184
Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	1276.2551071158762
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	959.6336284347361
But he believes his theory.	2307.8595941476615
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	1204.1378885283325
That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve?	551.8522281148927
Who helps to believe?	864.4114904324825

— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	1213.9461399991314
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	1574.0188144200984
He broke away.	2359.064240520683
— Come, Kinch.	1060.8118307372556
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	1435.072367531037
Come, Kinch.	1576.6854752637876
You have eaten all we left.	1705.6542974294182
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	5304.5164214702445
Stephen rose.	2708.468681375212
Life is many days.	3058.3581311966504
This will end.	3228.5854348667694
— We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	1108.2741261327362
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	6128.774741338253
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	5128.097427097592
— Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	862.1360340341372
I ’ ll be there.	649.0936678329967
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	1195.532404158696
Can you walk straight?	722.7649437749873

Swill till eleven.	11294.741023173998
Lubber...	100038.18749644158
Stephen followed a lubber...	13196.785697989848
One day in the national library we had a discussion.	1155.892114444799
Shakes.	5659.915422629268
After.	4434.517156407201
His lub back: I followed.	2389.9728366940913
I gall his kibe.	5645.374892115877
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	1453.231758173903
What have I learned?	333.0126021689174
Of them?	285.7757598165458

Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding: — A pleased bottom.	2566.810312893434
The turnstile.	5856.149054976505

The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	19683.05463689317
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won ’ t you wed a wife?	1022.9940711565152
He spluttered to the air: — O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	4939.805198747648
We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers ’ hall.	881.4606897537805

— Longworth and M ’ Curdy Atkinson were there...	6618.616371424426
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling: I hardly hear the purlieu cry Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by Before my thoughts begin to run On F.	3005.0394506455514
M ’ Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	2060.1050723002877
Jest on.	6447.084201215073
Know thyself.	14727.458756738186
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	1590.972390905162
I halt.	421.92116089314396
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	5520.130161267272
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	1728.6329944951142
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	2655.652445879147
A laugh tripped over his lips.	2690.895347271642
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	1496.4730860810369
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	1328.9245116667003
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	603.1396272263122
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	934.113234191398
One thinks of Homer.	4224.915809619478
He stopped at the stairfoot.	1815.5510425018656
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	6312.367037929356
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	2020.7782408000585
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	1629.0374980621268
But listen.	3941.562062369546
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	3219.180230792843
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	479.1401822688301
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	948.57266505162
Part.	11695.605131062071
The moment is now.	1253.3398311022934
Where then?	270.5619102605676
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	1408.7017650611872
Why?	190.44911106412906
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	956.214495529261
My will: his will that fronts me.	1392.6878195261888
Seas between.	12650.733552347781
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	971.6560099600717
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	956.7527951866574
The portico.	7397.326688112413
Here I watched the birds for augury.	2401.106338717321
Ængus of the birds.	1758.7890413540204
They go, they come.	925.2095748420522
Last night I flew.	2682.254903414822
Easily flew.	14796.529246051421
Men wondered.	1325.6125789927491
Street of harlots after.	3210.371722054171
A creamfruit melon he held to me.	2701.535219243506
In. You will see.	4179.668357418393
— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	787.3967135627913
Did you see his eye?	350.44556295847815
He looked upon you to lust after you.	1004.8241874996505
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	1974.843526568894
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	1014.7796822165417
Get thee a breechpad.	5973.0839658893765

Day.	5798.655857615648
Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	4196.032979796865
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	1133.9081292013454
They followed.	3297.433723216806
Speak on.	2364.631824353001
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	3385.2827235552304
No birds.	3968.1706151908725
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	2798.4163583111385
Cease to strive.	11231.011059040087
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.	3021.2284796990934
Laud we the gods And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our bless ’ d altars.	2499.914708463226
The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	657.9558475932764
J.	2953.906025021904
reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	2322.895772927348
Five to three.	2023.8515865781796
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	2379.8342039660606
What was that boy ’ s name again?	284.98550428874887
Dignam.	3993.303581518857
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
_Vere dignum et iustum <URL> Brother Swan was the person to see.	6944.478103188712
Mr Cunningham ’ s letter.	1041.5099090028898
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
Oblige him, if possible.	2191.9873639014745
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	4615.359847828373
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	2146.88383615858
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	1720.7434170779488
J.	2953.906025021904
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	812.2754575179388
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	3072.8032599333915
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	763.0673059517221
And you, father?	153.84114412772544
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	3789.612071783501
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	1527.927492151842
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	291.4048746548686
Was that so?	275.6872081932862
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	1532.002766101995
And Mr Sheehy himself?	484.5470904854903
Still in London.	2144.2230201949783
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	601.6009365205866
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	2142.975678837334
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	1891.8788119888313
O, yes: a very great success.	859.4726414533699
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	1611.676568532158
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	1630.3439275433836
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	944.2929911383369
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	1568.4323965321137
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	1383.5466476893512
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	884.0459189395336
A zealous man, however.	2180.0751662177604
Really he was.	2129.332907323039
And really did great good in his way.	1105.4538095490852
Beyond a doubt.	4366.455954766785
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	431.5525655922947
Of good family too would one think it?	672.2129782778479
Welsh, were they not?	353.30199378954586
O, lest he forget.	1496.141926281604
That letter to father provincial.	1981.1997756209976
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	530.7911536719779
The little house.	1652.1533039730384
Aha.	5846.311267724853
And were they good boys at school?	599.0256449625599
O.	2152.5665654701224
That was very good now.	1291.884259703334
And what was his name?	226.08964776220026
Jack Sohan.	15885.088095228493
And his name?	193.64971509265723
Ger.	15787.963800563719
Gallaher.	5849.244559282841
And the other little man?	238.8719089988927
His name was Brunny Lynam.	4987.9456051096695
O, that was a very nice name to have.	480.55958083232355
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	1410.0799203779945
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	626.3717148952112
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	1277.7841285819436
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	744.740152804184
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	1534.350175174038
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	2169.0732191746224
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	1417.7549240492156
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	554.0284096246331
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	1765.3267986683752
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	2081.5411094700407
A fine carriage she had.	1797.8721364550538
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	1445.836723323471
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	1349.7398492530517
what should he say?...	4648.177702850877
such a queenly mien.	1358.5880818618916
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	1884.0974473135045
The reverend T.	3193.373066166033
R.	5678.285904035367
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	2860.0990785898107
The incumbent they called him.	2356.4087424487675
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	1066.9193828207453
But one should be charitable.	3279.049981980568
Invincible ignorance.	34515.85074510494
They acted according to their lights.	3308.023662781567
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	1497.3720151202947
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	844.7129678777193
Surely, there ought to be.	1440.5189331955512
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	3578.8381176845737
All raised untidy caps.	8572.779720191791
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	4559.6709615888185
Christian brother boys.	10659.460532197298
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	1443.5760906619164
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	2407.928145994872
For aged and virtuous females.	4707.4376955870775
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	1460.2042610175413
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	5880.666437916738
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	5064.332350044159
And now it was an office or something.	950.1249740367927
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	1388.597013599008
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	3123.592123195436
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	955.2518336001895
In America those things were continually happening.	6546.2873031174595
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	2478.972120346714
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	1944.2942829328704
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	2779.601916766644
They saluted him and were saluted.	1471.6412206332536
Father Conmee passed H.	3982.8154697173477
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	1885.0014141330976
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	1703.8131586417715
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	1078.0684492026871
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	2175.744057033463
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	1068.6693833679994
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	3007.1833765151137
J.	2953.906025021904
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	1778.5868081833771
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	4303.043344661573
C.	3903.316026160732
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	1215.1991220872499
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	2197.8429149302387
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	1051.9776168586884
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	2580.300436899972
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	1357.9522492355952
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	11719.910212224322
It was a peaceful day.	1579.5404889118838
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	1441.4083707145976
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	1843.8417334542276
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	610.9931776494595
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	2860.9906623888105
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	1463.2392969049952
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	692.2398891255388
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	1008.2466920192043
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	822.9689745678278
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	722.442597496513
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	3457.844277271204
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	1125.9696237430896
J.	2953.906025021904
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	648.2478444262074
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	3995.0419820965126
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	1418.3181139044943
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	831.8552567596919
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	768.545538656639
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	948.3280674959161
The Malahide road was quiet.	2362.444358471517
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	1358.0111167223204
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	3957.558131311882
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	2012.385857993148
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	610.0103144567911
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	2621.8992023329274
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	1039.3084684991072
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	1480.4695792055431
Who could know the truth?	395.94880212866843
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	1518.8924856824126
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	1686.5152495617397
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	540.7494184150697
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	902.7585044655489
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	1909.2935610239474
He was humane and honoured there.	1667.1327744610835
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	851.0860463061073
It was a charming day.	1166.2344587492512
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	3355.994358912026
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	983.429684010528
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	1064.9669090019536
A just and homely word.	2264.332096092654
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	1447.2240010292255
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	3519.0847897124986
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	517.00357885456
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	1501.2062999394507
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	2666.108112122036
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	1346.7812044510486
Nones.	21558.06072352106
He should have read that before lunch.	1607.5699266256127
But lady Maxwell had come.	3786.587746306122
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	2862.181612447468
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	2563.7402040270945
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	1137.8282698832882
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	2033.5997515197794
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	7113.835603662905
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	1270.947904306871
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	1099.0504086799758
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	975.1515938083618
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	3481.704162760281
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	2002.556808588815
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	391.32673086556565
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	552.9637437960887
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	1217.8191595329574
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	551.3133855067357
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	2356.9694615124413
— What ’ s the best news?	241.3175818312326
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	1345.2926187875742
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	3361.9401830492125
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	1527.4862697212743
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	1035.621995690267
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	987.6300351146606
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	1854.172919082381
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	8630.49353583443
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	2354.77619017803
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	1570.8020843762054
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	1057.661595039645
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	2653.771175639754
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	1216.4869613533754
It fell on the path.	1265.3614606622075
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	573.5936450903762
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	1756.4495697972147
— Did you put in the books?	283.36966730683866
Boody asked.	4321.903234204338
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	4733.247131955717
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	630.8192386392574
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	4240.176575858384
— Where did you try?	391.0492142630478
Boody asked.	4321.903234204338
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	699.9348442075465
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	490.3236885981144
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	1522.1137512039845
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	1490.7925810846227
— What ’ s in the pot?	159.05647532164394
she asked.	1849.880150611534
— Shirts, Maggy said.	1963.7779249261082
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	858.797842131084
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	407.36421412169483
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	4893.147300170616
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	1963.7779249261082
Katey asked.	4333.868612264971
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	1675.9961510688058
The lacquey rang his bell.	2552.5583684255416
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	708.5002836847785
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	2440.289883996443
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	1443.1599656872008
Where ’ s Dilly?	296.42087203461534
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	1081.5164918090823
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	1306.7754112182386
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	1323.4994079365179
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	3954.24259339341
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	1056.0333205059476
— Put these in first, will you?	308.6397205085853
he said.	856.4235297911396
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	531.7633582064001
And the fruit on top.	1199.8727648958181
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	849.2062836499967
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	1519.4179491226155
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	2518.1444115267836
H.	5065.386603875897
E.	5027.68337428093
L.	5104.02473378521
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	3647.753429850869
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	855.2406241026939
— Can you send them by tram?	581.8310366386892
Now?	228.22056799667087
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	3298.357783710411
— Certainly, sir.	1000.4476587737099
Is it in the city?	212.29358991792236
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	644.1447217367997
Ten minutes.	6275.28372867124
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	2027.3267283131506
— Will you write the address, sir?	346.1165791312679
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	1171.2832093942416
— Send it at once, will you?	277.2520962035283
he said.	856.4235297911396
It ’ s for an invalid.	1380.6410750341645
— Yes, sir.	717.4852047500266
I will, sir.	644.8387257628339
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	1966.7149815686043
— What ’ s the damage?	254.38567712725703
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	2055.8020251805
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	1343.6848338602188
A young pullet.	6273.202302004149
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	2740.19475516026
he asked gallantly.	3818.171036506678
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	1121.3797963532575
— Yes, sir, she said.	412.8004919791327
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	5490.149984391962
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	1224.1422009809426
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	572.0349732196781
he asked roguishly.	4602.8362022411675
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	2038.9715960587066
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	2260.185370933467
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	3470.440026088431
Palefaces.	15787.963800563719
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	1649.0574797095398
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	2187.9680986588437
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	11799.955221357266
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	135392.32189353742
È peccato.	50041.95876441744
Perchè la sua voce...	115266.60944783829
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	26809.20642307323
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	1679.794103748366
_Ma, dia retta a me.	4499.557488457753
Ci rifletta_.	50041.95876441744
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	1840.6233646149155
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	1727.8615392666595
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	2528.662107729548
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	729.8187705769366
Human eyes.	6984.441395310085
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	2703.861950080064
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	931.8805635053268
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	9169.686231048454
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	1135.8340232978394
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	3585.2592203726163
_Scusi, eh?	770.4441581261555
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	3681.6339442570975
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	2792.9094645418154
Too much mystery business in it.	2006.7674206920635
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	260.845117214666
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	4382.715438790059
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	1087.9147897716355
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	2073.543955240579

Y. ’ S and plodded back as they had come.	2290.542145108666
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	1268.7509389530521
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	6689.666078220907
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	284.32073045011924
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	596.9010972773199
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	1271.3398527088966
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	2388.580614584503
They kick out grand.	2999.3541728949494
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	1528.7549406502656
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	1476.5503009708393
— Hello.	2064.952753185032
Yes, sir.	986.1763453947318
No, sir.	939.9037845980909
Yes, sir.	986.1763453947318
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	1026.748724091084
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	858.7285105191937
All right, sir.	1082.0473533871755
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	976.0992891499449
A quarter after.	2422.0505766251395
Yes, sir.	986.1763453947318
Twentyseven and six.	4983.398972188074
I ’ ll tell him.	736.0068189005732
Yes: one, seven, six.	698.8378439706444
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	1264.9579288002774
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	992.9446078035483
Mr Lenehan, yes.	1001.2719547903812
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	510.5250338805441
No, sir.	939.9037845980909
Yes, sir.	986.1763453947318
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	1026.748724091084
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	2869.42004946512
— Who ’ s that?	141.6648028955735
Ned Lambert asked.	3689.8461898340634
Is that Crotty?	959.5238855912168
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	2792.716865878401
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	270.40586970433776
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	2870.2031799982715
Come on.	1743.2814679461444
Mind your steps there.	2922.0431642297904
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	874.4365456430658
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	1505.750958568851
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	1234.3972600204077
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	882.9148801590945
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	1727.470943836285
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	1223.7266569402018
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	800.4540616386341
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	343.6449694664673
— No, Ned.	815.9110412398833
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	1502.3185968028172
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	629.4729720440445
That ’ s quite right, sir.	705.7847029713665
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	1088.6240391974768
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	1200.555489135373
Bring the camera whenever you like.	2490.8870188352707
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	426.262628427632
You can take it from here or from here.	1000.1771345042237
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	1410.083880680105
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	1252.0898108162246
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	706.5163624817325
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	4650.101871995837
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	765.0004931439843
Drop in whenever you like.	2050.1763368584116
Next week, say.	2730.065530603142
Can you see?	309.7432656111422
— Yes, yes.	744.3834467704137
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	1696.8964681756445
Very pleased to have met you.	1705.2119129435862
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	1433.271490765142
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	1616.1114108022464
With J.	2754.3283653202484
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	1796.3152006862956
He stood to read the card in his hand.	629.3588398530455
— The reverend Hugh C.	2196.423189091559
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	2656.175372164095
Nice young chap he is.	1741.7339326722954
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	851.8996232750424
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	621.9038703456846
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	1209.1646841566185
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	1080.3276557388467
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Molloy said.	1048.05373110003
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	1306.148619505591
— God! he cried.	852.8911772171014
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	1021.3217130845558
You know that one?	242.87900075298487
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	524.7005815102314
What?	122.71942533465327
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	690.6021074645113
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	602.5412169065312
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	1043.0652332137363
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	1636.4458146625439
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	1921.1753064173652
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	627.4039677695554
What is it?	149.64377956376987
What ’ s the trouble?	169.1384194443667
Wait awhile.	5492.530473753303
Hold hard.	5411.578535247881
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	1235.2597890734994
— Chow! he said.	1229.482340742389
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	1454.9009476798208
J.	2953.906025021904
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	2584.52865661187
cold night before...	15341.924167372425
blast your soul...	7057.999101177226
night before last...	13419.256501721928
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	1485.6632887888977
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	3475.8149160898206
— I was...	4619.781589965785
Glasnevin this morning...	17235.02015682292
poor little...	18982.828983369734
what do you call him...	4842.527491803902
Chow!...	30861.685567655666
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	1096.5996873106283
— See?	211.17960394362643
he said.	856.4235297911396
Say it ’ s turn six.	1267.687047308799
In here, see.	921.1499362677827
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	2644.990114487982
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	1293.6356747582822
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	1963.8958863309213
— See?	211.17960394362643
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	898.331740629183
The impact.	5856.149054976505
Leverage, see?	495.6771915280084
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	1195.3576089471144
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	846.3651332097357
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	947.286719793142
— See?	211.17960394362643
Tom Rochford said.	3221.6068460163865
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	544.9479526220102
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	743.2709380205637
One good turn deserves another.	3849.6334057780077
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	1185.66963712488
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	1150.4252473777315
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	1643.3922294120678
When you two begin...	10889.117934843367
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	1051.0610052438954
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	511.5765461371278
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	1602.7557952836942
See you later.	2896.7827975249443
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	400.734660164192
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	550.0682292132552
The drain, you mean.	1777.636812930834
— Drain?	691.3922142010439
Lenehan said.	1929.8150217715097
It was down a manhole.	1663.668051635009
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	2331.730306866328
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	2165.2615695135987
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	1088.6555374232958
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	734.6849033988105
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	966.8759272037165
— The act of a hero, he said.	434.2890432704056
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	1991.8071956642905
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	381.12517144295776
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	1249.3373579384916
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	356.30886745974146
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	1932.5193820490415
— After three, he said.	625.551909343065
Who ’ s riding her?	282.6411449935881
— O.	1098.989747953439
Madden, Lenehan said.	1153.5601123592598
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	1811.0884340894147
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	862.7049793767065
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	556.9241268301791
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	1384.0737194551805
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	993.924395037616
Through here.	4103.5730566930415
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	1315.4336959666591
— There he is, Lenehan said.	514.1655129643852
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	760.4444741559497
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	750.2802933594877
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	796.2078395285013
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	615.3667515657394
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	876.616381518634
Astronomy it was about.	2015.0589582462921
Lenehan laughed.	4224.488742121583
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	644.8813606512479
Come over in the sun.	850.6097652154547
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	1799.829299776068
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	1069.5288026734518
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	1289.0347028567364
The annual dinner, you know.	1141.6917709620157
Boiled shirt affair.	15902.480213260269
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	1143.882067327029
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	4734.8512134970615
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	626.2772976128513
My missus sang there once.	3474.372696779683
— Did she?	231.5332915724053
Lenehan said.	1929.8150217715097
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	4780.237922477327
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	1797.7417296488582
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	584.21907081417
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	2243.4923703981535
Bloom and the wife were there.	564.9138400941157
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	2629.38763724455
Fast and furious it was.	812.2571799660814
After liquids came solids.	19629.60595919211
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	54706.17862754336
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	550.0682292132552
The year the missus was there...	3790.4056596998944
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	5847.722015948251
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	584.21907081417
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	1179.7654253228814
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	949.7347381136267
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	411.33302521219406
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	3744.6113474367803
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	1913.875606040289
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	2229.4484412607817
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	658.3090647036873
Like that.	1840.9244268721798
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	1275.3536051089977
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	1098.3373223253968
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	726.9089054485447
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	1272.719542510172
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	718.7593723784711
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	384.24646225276086
He knows them all, faith.	934.2333005070988
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	959.8953442039154
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	1501.931142578213
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	724.0034978109851
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	1556.004536256885
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	884.9696175414723
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	1304.4725582093906
Lenehan walked on again.	1893.5958889512874
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	3506.1395204224314
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	1120.1003002149503
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	639.8087064220068
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	1932.8635601922497
you know...	12335.939839566687
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	551.9128789006431
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	2671.3018416776413
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	3709.916158900429
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	797.4187320304378
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	973.3165412299646
Child born every minute somewhere.	7423.776598573218
Mrs Purefoy.	4244.749765461465
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	3464.8071724283627
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	210.3765532957663
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	1217.7349606037853
— Them are two good ones, he said.	1088.992966018842
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	1191.8089893162644
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	683.8615181760515
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	1412.7486901968878
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	321.8256449957322
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	18640.648701361515
Know the kind that is.	921.6049746140111
Had it?	244.64553767741637
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
He opened it.	1435.2468947955188
Thought so.	3361.5069564664764
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	596.3088269941699
Listen: the man.	905.5830792322869
Got her it once.	1521.5637532379933
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	777.0638588457552
More in her line.	1522.1934326036323
Let us see.	2433.2399870715735
He read where his finger opened.	1856.6432691406405
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	1146.5287744429302
This.	4240.008797606501
Here.	4163.460194123237
Try.	5827.72223398114
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	2112.5769031014415
Take this.	3373.1596393849095
The end.	2107.52818206121
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	1717.90813116555
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	4412.348118058606
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	2327.2091292863706
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	2898.8315059090755
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	10958.648169198674
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	5074.308638413411
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	2968.461326143837
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	4503.771344554265
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	6906.558370550234
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	1478.5358209619997
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	547.3037699370615
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	1430.8548672900463
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	3109.565983405216
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	1444.901345684522
Mr Bloom beheld it.	1397.6459315790692
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	785.9142212232122
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	6861.0771140332945
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	321.4119680430937
That ’ s a good one.	545.5572341854343
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	755.7996324874781
Four and nine.	2342.255233471678
Those lovely curtains.	5893.141728411454
Five shillings.	5665.436806548004
Cosy curtains.	14745.820837099007
Selling new at two guineas.	4073.9097105730452
Any advance on five shillings?	1497.3621860459205
Going for five shillings.	3078.8467695649992
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	2166.1833389659932
J.	2953.906025021904
A.	2028.0615964047747
Jackson, W.	3656.9396131140397

Munro and H.	4418.775145440554
T.	5268.119875574054
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	2660.318939533627
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	1210.5111160973645
He halted near his daughter.	1826.8874856122734
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	342.6415505977091
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	612.6727340841347
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	1007.8508346573116
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	5810.734037150883
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	931.2545180375364
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	632.171111677324
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	711.5483508713464
Do you know what you look like?	404.305408075366
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	1692.8394570719058
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	578.0754696177489
All the people are looking at you.	910.0960026273644
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	975.5762247320106
— Did you get any money?	477.95802267220324
Dilly asked.	4082.232411520149
— Where would I get money?	387.0026304183702
Mr Dedalus said.	1331.3949844220363
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	1340.9511754993994
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	546.452980856257
— How do you know that?	264.0352932189719
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	735.3983344193139
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	1000.8276208024068
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	751.6084081913624
Were you in the Scotch house now?	393.72715394580723
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	904.8950531738749
Here.	4163.460194123237
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	531.9899992124173
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	805.9173160496699
Give me more than that.	1414.0909334321943
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	1848.5501200064375
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	218.63245797850465
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	4512.604290879721
But wait awhile.	4140.960919593049
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	894.0945409436839
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	1176.4385118236705
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	1345.4420885173156
He ’ s dead.	714.0692740808523
The man upstairs is dead.	1670.9889874130608
He left her and walked on.	709.6651443512932
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	2424.8910073715556
— Well, what is it?	169.64067078815071
he said, stopping.	719.1308848880998
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	3096.134666730773
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	861.000747421225
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	840.496157964656
— Watch him, he said.	511.13038273523597
It ’ s instructive.	1145.7684689587975
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	657.8229461496401
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	539.4749931580109
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	955.3266467258392
Look, there ’ s all I have.	434.7424858732306
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	711.1290614154719
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	515.1307590043122
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	483.6187721658494
Dilly said.	2593.7699208117724
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	1577.6136559630036
— I will, he said gravely.	506.7765942873163
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	979.0363804552686
I ’ ll try this one now.	949.552800784237
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	869.4220776089544
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	985.3041828035895
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	919.2582249117274
I ’ ll be home shortly.	1140.8629297847922
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	679.6073583953543
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	874.0675456638057
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	787.0576174203394
The lacquey banged loudly.	7080.135485669889
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	1257.4612556381787
Got round him all right.	1546.1931844707472
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	466.52224750351274
First rate, sir.	1971.70774611571
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	1147.1074385292873
How are things going?	520.3947931694862
Just keeping alive.	6448.209318581639
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	2491.982854336661
Yes, indeed.	1380.7168519538807
Good for the country.	1090.1184908217729
Those farmers are always grumbling.	10819.151887970707
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	1462.570849703395
Yes, sir.	986.1763453947318
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	22984.220369431725
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	2786.686289478392
And heartrending scenes.	7694.400460962091
Men trampling down women and children.	1636.6920437883173
Most brutal thing.	9236.481047395122
What do they say was the cause?	325.94220000390095
Spontaneous combustion.	31633.267610030063
Most scandalous revelation.	22504.368036521893
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	2941.4100200240964
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	2212.688277389847
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	1111.2613685740516
You know why?	406.35098547671413
Palm oil.	18288.327834398002
Is that a fact?	270.53891185889137
Without a doubt.	718.0048217016804
Well now, look at that.	732.5964568921939
And America they say is the land of the free.	686.0106171830515
I thought we were bad here.	1485.9810904791689
I smiled at him.	955.5652502614396
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	728.2237036099442
_What is it?	427.9733589060768
The sweepings of every country including our own.	3080.3673780721974
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	575.9894716799882
Graft, my dear sir.	2567.503741325514
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	514.3284004098949
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	856.9814624582967
Dress does it.	4107.246537736327
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	3500.805984767758
Bowls them over.	5258.684929569768
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	849.1482488228769
How are things?	409.4203430963321
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	626.0630517782637
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	2187.6778139494813
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	2788.0674717448746
Scott of Dawson street.	4299.210522649231
Never built under three guineas.	4832.243191223738
Fits me down to the ground.	1588.7359739528645
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	4119.829562693638
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	884.3087840123212
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	2318.33121453318
Knight of the road.	1988.7171462501183
Gentleman.	13137.782459902772
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	735.0749627259856
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	1029.0566092897748
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	1005.8745470478616
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	1646.5197514005863
High colour, of course.	1157.5131022765424
Grizzled moustache.	17720.413549698675
Returned Indian officer.	14099.805730522807
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	4487.935010562764
Is that Ned Lambert ’ s brother over the way, Sam?	546.4136082931719
What?	122.71942533465327
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	494.54254809006017
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	2177.5220422856173
Damn like him.	1854.4915737845256
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	2986.7909878925093
Good drop of gin, that was.	1046.3944292260564
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	4919.896864815109
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	2919.360965696415
Greasy black rope.	10422.076907356577
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant ’ s wife drove by in her noddy.	1331.3324914213226
Bad times those were.	2908.1238427897865
Well, well.	1159.7124622609733
Over and done with.	1356.0309027436517
Great topers too.	7950.684271837384
Fourbottle men.	12271.05914758432
Let me see.	1882.9636447660928
Is he buried in saint Michan ’ s?	259.5673683551312
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	568.0214469627147
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	1233.5626453623127
Dignam is there now.	1419.7068824546684
Went out in a puff.	1732.3273353259567
Well, well.	1159.7124622609733
Better turn down here.	2913.315426332447
Make a detour.	5902.384257489103
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	1845.827141788066
Damn dangerous thing.	9505.851494881184
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	4534.124851223328
Runaway horse.	15284.871329719703
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton ’ s office, led his wife over O ’ Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	1030.575724014033
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	3695.497486294088
Times of the troubles.	1778.2501427273955
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	783.7644526803406
Gaming at Daly ’ s.	904.2840211124055
No cardsharping then.	6376.487941093103
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	1238.3055248546318
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	5513.95912844315
Stables behind Moira house.	14987.345503474127
Damn good gin that was.	2500.9408640503684
Fine dashing young nobleman.	11753.294574891432
Good stock, of course.	1053.4073350764652
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	1417.3151027363322
Course they were on the wrong side.	1205.9199052788024
They rose in dark and evil days.	1537.8113015096217
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	3967.2552932868202
They were gentlemen.	2652.6910592768722
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	5955.780703668923
Masterly rendition.	39616.09131016968
_At the siege of Ross did my father <URL> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	1219.9032475946442
Frockcoats.	21558.06072352106
Cream sunshades.	27324.731655759035
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	2051.727403120601
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	900.5623978637681
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	1976.2265515268564
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	3222.5772606400574
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	5152.5085856000205
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	2622.521415195547
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	943.4155764335032
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	3008.820661920216
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	3981.380897070155
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	5438.5117640756835
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	2446.12357677843
A long and seafed silent rut.	1603.6468755933743
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	1090.0020299314565
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	1386.293789326339
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	6035.666998365142
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	502.1088556200939
The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes.	4742.165456585251
A lore of drugs.	1071.014729971204
Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.	4115.427787210506
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	1143.9455547214213
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	2989.5909095704415

Yes, quite true.	1543.8783514058955
You say right, sir.	1032.2835814510413
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	2087.5567786160973
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	3325.707120934893

Stephen said.	1342.343346619359
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	4698.555254262213

— I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.	466.24874781217983
Is it any good?	393.1059455024052

he asked.	1347.8912926122985

She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	2317.066723979886

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	1846.0778427406929
How are things?	409.4203430963321
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	626.0630517782637
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	3227.1356411421825
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	1954.2630859329079
— What ’ s the best news?	241.3175818312326
Mr Dedalus said.	1331.3949844220363
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	922.4526268825415
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	1257.929039532795
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	349.5698610291267
Who is it?	185.8758635352534
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	3009.634629610833
— With a broken back, is it?	230.02747689976133
Mr Dedalus asked.	1913.7267970502212
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	880.4308247586005
Reuben of that ilk.	2565.125825633844
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	560.7989967541638
All I want is a little time.	814.7940048631718
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	586.1055000829533
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	493.9447850041422
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	1490.2509331170058
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	1319.890554967434
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	366.4958991762179
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	1233.9021163218392
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	3691.4101346745824
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	1061.880952203948
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	968.2723407503247
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	1915.789576886861
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	351.12158520288983
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	1358.3164774350307
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	928.160652078913
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	1045.8693498434309
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	840.693970516454
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	583.6014714886079
Father Cowley asked.	3339.4774298966036
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	2289.190005009951
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	1245.3711885082803
— Aw! he said.	1405.079727029472
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	590.5302867408714
— What about that?	170.82598582584686
Ben Dollard said.	2544.3187118635524
Not too dusty?	589.19375000164
What?	122.71942533465327
He turned to both.	1176.3550163190891
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	779.2165535261554
The reverend Hugh C.	3449.990437760045
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	1373.9428547406706
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	484.8331439762101
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	1240.3093570319536
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	1912.4601730459071
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	812.4030616703313
Come along.	3489.188222798229
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	1915.4692785751495
Wait awhile...	31130.18130829409
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	575.8668148565367
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	1305.681522371068
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	2126.422010816276
— What few days?	401.36681580785535
he boomed.	4035.6665568328835
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	1691.9741025612827
— He has, Father Cowley said.	749.3186922414727
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	513.8909767716327
The landlord has the prior claim.	1198.722776495956
I gave him all the particulars.	1101.8331289407818
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	8998.837358739813
Love is the name?	243.06386171649277
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	601.5638722580755
The reverend Mr Love.	2269.118578090334
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	747.0176462852789
But are you sure of that?	237.89646545783341
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	874.113815517015
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	1673.256365316353
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	841.1048778956281
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	1099.8063060439233
The policeman touched his forehead.	994.6096926452217
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	1106.229757491938
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	1388.8674685373333
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	843.2972406208137
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	1039.3140218319452
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	945.1564942309475
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	1013.5536915075035
— Boyd?	476.8796238379752
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	2926.931456625465
Touch me not.	2009.303116977303
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	1547.5650648462295
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	2974.6839495209833
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	2982.3279270100547
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	1333.6398517125015
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	982.9532312048536
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	841.7520094216334
And put down the five shillings too.	1216.4800444010277
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	605.8653094304785
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	1717.7330441113918
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	4626.5018328004335
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	600.8587104081931
They went down Parliament street.	3236.056044950551
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	570.4169176213715
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	1492.413056279518
Here goes.	4606.732777974686
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	3386.7145942442025
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	1461.9113741143003
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	873.0055674916708
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	1221.6104954612256
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	4113.201078926606
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	1459.1891831722266
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	935.7515149138961
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	1506.1068609470076
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	807.7206822214307
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	1903.4127926869082
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	1781.357543541439
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	3878.6614892573034
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	1351.7142203405438
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	2030.4204012871426
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	287.07004546515844
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	1951.6472187471763
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	3025.21717710402
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	1787.707419894366
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	854.4810722576835
— What Dignam was that?	219.90046993691647
long John Fanning asked.	3118.365849478035
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	2011.7500983720454
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	497.2505288962567
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	2072.667534624454
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	1762.9242596380773
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	646.4098817937604
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	2027.5323403707355
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	817.7568301153804
— Rather lowsized.	7106.618235714903
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	648.1612756440942
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	2316.64701836921
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	4626.231369418959
— What ’ s that?	121.33936717810553
Martin Cunningham said.	2232.9206301861036
All turned where they stood.	2086.0529241998847
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	2862.68806032403
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	1296.9608940635405
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	1301.7364073903286
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	678.7088678326633
— What was it?	138.33644331627102
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	780.3060581122196
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	1174.1843802997128
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	1994.170247714597
There in the corner.	766.9740460754199
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	1064.9677037462693
— Is that he?	167.68533636842562
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	1433.0441037833116
— Yes, Mulligan said.	650.2885892937678
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	539.1022599245741
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	2550.077616880866
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	1196.4519889155151
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	699.504256980983
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	1435.170533775156
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	1770.8562504506242
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	1339.392437572927
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	1647.1626650196763
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	454.89647913330623
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	1579.3641095795674
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	5022.6466203111
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	1019.5850307743859
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	815.6475371450241
Wandering Ængus I call him.	4630.181790914885
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	1494.728133201298
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	1489.7406330768629
Such persons always have.	3684.1530265103493
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	2487.0422627886137
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	1008.9108776623198
He will never capture the Attic note.	4491.768918035313
That is his tragedy.	454.132505945646
He can never be a poet.	1092.2198099868006
The joy of creation...	8492.335962451261
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	1298.164981789313
I see.	1135.9875471135967
I tackled him this morning on belief.	2822.2493466256387
There was something on his mind, I saw.	606.126414915164
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	1175.453522381878
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	1836.0080813866434
He helped her to unload her tray.	2221.186687736323
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	1039.5273348204923
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	964.3740544361717
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	2245.436922949633
Does he write anything for your movement?	783.1541839900201
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	2385.5721305303864
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	2909.987937733542
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	916.8298962146978
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	619.2041859145954
He is going to write something in ten years.	1042.2251417409432
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	935.8941059370053
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	900.3164065796753
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	1853.8948476077214
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	989.4641632259384
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	900.4731205124682
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	2212.9248361433415
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	3142.6908985761524
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	1773.875027896732
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	1713.4460280734697
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	2542.2099074899725
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	904.3017807862725
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	3312.0554519922243
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	1505.0620189194049
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	2293.253308033318
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	3081.699236582678
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	1151.8604295613259
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	1214.4742465233007
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	2375.146676926023
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	2853.877663172381
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	10624.16296630998
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	1021.2078087931502
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	903.2699301890431
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	3390.051443620174
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	1866.160889026626
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	1113.3111268792784
That ’ s me in mourning.	684.3026737620352
When is it?	216.52749894234552
May the twentysecond.	4597.035381964776
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	814.6743323207398
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	661.3225454468976
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	1318.802729889104
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	1391.2906331674837
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	1952.8009870093483
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	3801.8611735676704
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	920.4960997684062
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	2370.591253771201
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	685.6519421212079
No Sandymount tram.	4796.859429559628
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	1937.3413296586343
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	718.8985489480928
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	1003.6437179603502
He met schoolboys with satchels.	3726.121860440966
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	1461.137771904299
He met other schoolboys.	2589.703629183522
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	470.40437555253374
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	1358.9722156323237
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	581.4561934486214
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	699.0724341954548
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	1026.8073119318983
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	810.1868839446645
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	954.8737476534932
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	732.9859219951713
Never see him again.	1762.9683474047008
Death, that is.	244.04263696140615
Pa is dead.	4429.9225668363515
My father is dead.	2009.047787469002
He told me to be a good son to ma.	733.8976444235034
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	620.5228185359905
Poor pa.	5874.062220413572
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	785.9438891895776
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	687.4179017313852

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.	1307.574984773092
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis.	1801.0804530011624
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar.	4153.478975469194

In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	1439.2021832423077
Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King ’ s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty.	1827.4462262755444

From Cahill ’ s corner the reverend Hugh C.	2074.8731192648347

A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	7827.863618637978
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	771.1366859167567
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	1789.4559381578104
The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	1292.7340198271966

Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade.	1472.092618260772
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	605.6655029883517
A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	2474.70744144054

In Fownes ’ s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal ’ s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	2755.074103511193
John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it.	2028.7825287853816
Where the foreleg of King Billy ’ s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders.	1740.57401196264

Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	931.352878251045
— Is that her?	184.31199281936338
asked miss Kennedy.	4102.591296797429
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	1812.3607988827162
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	1315.814112780268
— Who?	168.13827833536334
Where?	188.90416504930744
gold asked more eagerly.	3425.032307546542
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	642.5316512450518
He ’ s looking.	720.4528290433984
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	1089.2670567685434
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	1701.627781119008
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	1028.0128933266485
With sadness.	12229.97239828373
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	2069.6605757158377
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	1286.8869057923819
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	5166.605270310323
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	393.3624106348461
A man.	1611.456735125259
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	1355.386899970042
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	648.8332320531401
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	485.3747323280663
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	2700.629021461857
— What is it?	149.07323958384464
loud boots unmannerly asked.	9816.530230575907
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	2562.1290128451265
— Your _beau, _ is it?	385.2148338975888
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	2089.4000615718173
Bloom.	1994.4318862221655
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	2717.418075956754
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	1143.3727643423167
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	2308.7539784605524
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	2616.5743252198554
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	1030.7411904918597
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	2081.622130711298
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	691.5200203988326
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	1722.8670623343141
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	1184.0758963328653
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	6112.6467872064295
It gets brown after.	3081.608199226678
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	1521.9277425711773
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	508.1931735009286
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	1477.545485093318
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	2742.683867139324
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	1028.9786584266403
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	970.986057628906
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	3759.182400808043
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	464.6332002905993
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	705.9221006102642
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	1499.5920530154765
says he.	1080.34130870042
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	802.804223761383
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	3727.799705745616
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	1423.465301637212
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	1630.9583827822057
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	3899.4219632545637
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	4567.873907712026
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	1746.2216732357515
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	1157.4328292438543
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	1755.8646375057929
Why do I always think Figather?	1110.6679213188036
Gathering figs, I think.	3924.982506298286
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	5661.38234572556
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	1464.8718072767256
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	976.6851722069747
God they believe she is: or goddess.	1371.6107778353191
Those today.	4964.775961364292
I could not see.	966.7907591713374
That fellow spoke.	3106.289351792743
A student.	3029.198751937241
After with Dedalus ’ son.	1287.5478294353106
He might be Mulligan.	1409.8741316289363
All comely virgins.	5291.498528898516
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	1583.4430939883964
By went his eyes.	1529.0590224918476
The sweets of sin.	1682.5253442562832
Sweet are the sweets.	1864.2620160882175
Of sin.	5270.8949059431925
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	2230.5249150431478
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	1594.330696277131
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	1058.1394862286022
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	2400.0274885805293
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	1106.59909061939
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	1355.6945979552745
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	1447.265366837156
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	851.2515920045147
And then laughed more.	1973.352806924055
Greasy I knows.	4577.145581877464
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	2611.683813339699
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	746.3033352913994
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	1120.6743083161555
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	1693.3028803356556
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	1248.2991009614923
I feel all wet.	1603.2869934518526
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	2022.2919875937475
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	1758.1604456874559
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	1891.0541614736708
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	1526.0843139230485
Religion pays.	18812.731941147817
Must see him for that par.	1215.3626262256128
Eat first.	4098.552835233682
I want.	1460.4103059247022
Not yet.	3811.780676683064
At four, she said.	946.9213375034711
Time ever passing.	4411.109295321612
Clockhands turning.	16270.68850963357
On. Where eat?	2352.301532631021
The Clarence, Dolphin.	2603.174726507862
On. For Raoul.	11134.220427104643
Eat.	5828.641383569536
If I net five guineas with those ads.	2444.3826971184812
The violet silk petticoats.	4028.11952236898
Not yet.	3811.780676683064
The sweets of sin.	1682.5253442562832
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	6312.185533375706
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	3965.5787678465385
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	893.8230982088246
He strolled.	2704.5787590986874
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	865.2230827161123
He held her hand.	1305.3795401473467
Enjoyed her holidays?	2397.614214572184
— Tiptop.	3911.0486764800676
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	3715.5685705894507
— Gorgeous, she said.	1056.4238270922658
Lying out on the strand all day.	1455.396065318043
Bronze whiteness.	12970.979257467869
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	1020.8924475062512
Tempting poor simple males.	9902.559790672269
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	1794.721136746149
— O go away! she said.	785.388379755513
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	761.9467983499354
He was.	925.9007863369217
— Well now I am, he mused.	738.0662026151292
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	1662.5514529340664
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	1674.05640629456
And what did the doctor order today?	583.0797498076655
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	808.9117687529313
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	803.8438416742185
Jingle.	5798.655857615648
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	1966.0225302071187
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	1845.7349740884683
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	2585.905668945587
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	1897.1349771570503
Alacrity she served.	8618.703491568102
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	6410.884884329481
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	677.5981761607051
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	1047.0105005986727
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	1207.7398546409001
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	588.5170237017699
Chips.	13137.782459902772
Shreds.	21558.06072352106
Musing.	21558.06072352106
Mute.	15787.963800563719
None nought said nothing.	1221.8967821656863
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	748.5022055379744
In came Lenehan.	2554.2336012228798
Round him peered Lenehan.	3427.375621793606
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	4211.290463771242
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	1683.6084893924406
To Martha I must write.	2385.8514935134235
Buy paper.	8709.206496932702
Daly ’ s.	308.3499380689121
Girl there civil.	4205.168628469417
Bloom.	1994.4318862221655
Old Bloom.	2606.517452184982
Blue bloom is on the rye.	2082.059352191321
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	901.6512147163558
Lenehan came forward.	3219.785676799346
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	473.4641446723577
He asked.	1673.8871582235108
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	466.3210250834058
She asked.	2279.2454864537585
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	1276.3413431491938
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	2073.852020978942
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	131.4821378038491
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	3384.642775306283
To mind her stops.	2616.235593614254
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	1965.9187432022343
Jingle jaunty jingle.	11715.682861351934
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	2405.283064423152
Take no notice.	4106.41893987875
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	3827.354632426838
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	4213.105229337886
He droned in vain.	3167.3619248582354
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	1991.042618806811
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	867.6901939088588
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	1289.7855831847369
— Who may he be?	293.3257903596863
Mr Dedalus asked.	1913.7267970502212
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	6662.1518367092995
Who?	176.13832567394323
— Who may he be?	293.3257903596863
he asked.	1347.8912926122985
Can you ask?	458.4232349268975
Dry.	21558.06072352106
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	1281.744154702507
— I see, he said.	339.17867688807905
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	837.7196692203747
I hear he is keeping very select company.	2375.668186725785
Have you seen him lately?	615.8495747727146
He had.	1179.375792221852
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	982.5165042895566
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	1210.8078900187575
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	1598.067532656115
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	1640.8728978691156
I see.	1135.9875471135967
He see.	1412.949679041045
He drank.	2480.539838868753
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	8262.289751409382
Set down his glass.	3661.1580785930596
— I see you have moved the piano.	730.0024159486153
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	972.1543402565197
— Is that a fact?	247.7815882451579
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	337.1430675794116
The real classical, you know.	1098.402373474199
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	955.2595552764443
— Is that a fact?	247.7815882451579
Mr Dedalus said.	1331.3949844220363
He drank and strayed away.	2443.7027593387265
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	1452.4341302922887
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	973.289958315851
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	1787.0681720629698
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	1012.572373491105
Lager for diner.	9455.376300286009
Lager without alacrity she served.	9348.714909388007
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	2662.6256414221575
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	1152.6661407507818
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	1302.7970957029247
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	1548.52583769816
Are you not happy in your home?	490.6273115916479
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	2754.4471100350956
Means something, language of flow.	2454.5025766679328
Was it a daisy?	682.0668201950799
Innocence that is.	2414.80133005259
Respectable girl meet after mass.	6966.890128716285
Thanks awfully muchly.	15754.054744187333
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	1486.365644466645
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	2421.300187140427
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	14007.426119439853
For some man.	2113.609376764993
For Raoul.	4823.059555413868
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	2136.279021206479
It is.	1477.0299770974034
Again.	5828.641383569536
Coincidence.	648.4142163114785
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	2019.5092815323424
Follow.	15787.963800563719
Risk it.	6298.85791733158
Go quick.	5513.175290389498
At four.	4044.392449221924
Near now.	3622.4104875544886
Out.	5225.663890838169
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	1257.9780212164408
— Aha...	17550.591827344306
I was forgetting...	8708.565554314244
Excuse...	45722.41492870458
— And four.	1397.0153980768378
At four she.	2565.0308528282867
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	8359.166253070756
Bloo smi qui go.	3824.045333396323
Ternoon.	21558.06072352106
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	591.7892255949456
For men.	3177.408437862467
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	3374.2035075919043
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	1000.3393259463866
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	996.1506934265751
A call again.	2057.1417375531923
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	1869.091573565895
You hear?	287.9606752078586
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	3438.1150616518617
Longer in dying call.	5129.346406399208
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	1391.8809955914285
— _The bright stars fade_...	19701.085922806287
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	4633.976305947494
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	2375.587214975394
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	379.18832516202036
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	39153.8291677438
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	1994.83887084571
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	557.9419262967431
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	1048.5913861303509
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	1524.7921378918923
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	522.894157565001
he asked her.	926.0044745012855
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	1249.370401354013
Like lady, ladylike.	3061.385471807681
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	1425.1929206262887
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	1494.0112511301882
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	1657.499506659383
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	1413.0038402662449
See me he might.	1422.7260332374683
The seat he sat on: warm.	1220.0427552607823
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	4363.4958018200705
— _And I from thee_...	9920.30599947422
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	743.0756553171518
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	1120.9186541364838
She smiled on him.	1249.8042802029613
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	1433.9863756902407
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	32106.18616829405
— What ’ s your cry?	246.89224292539168
Glass of bitter?	117.832877679238
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	478.72089123079564
Not yet.	3811.780676683064
At four she.	2565.0308528282867
Who said four?	358.210845805376
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	642.2818430297406
Avoid.	21558.06072352106
Goulding a chance.	2373.578589889014
What is he doing in the Ormond?	267.10253156613896
Car waiting.	11959.65260385767
Wait.	4301.167531310137
Hello.	4990.896473038367
Where off to?	215.15976813956163
Something to eat?	413.57836507254336
I too was just.	870.4201816449824
In here.	2376.5398810124607
What, Ormond?	213.30475617013164
Best value in Dublin.	2525.559075842236
Is that so?	243.88084886216
Diningroom.	21558.06072352106
Sit tight there.	3981.202080810243
See, not be seen.	1039.7436334127094
I think I ’ ll join you.	802.2888130278383
Come on.	1743.2814679461444
Richie led on.	2827.5756940754845
Bloom followed bag.	3349.3443741860606
Dinner fit for a prince.	3094.78915779355
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	860.0974170310692
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	2010.5733271362376
— Why don ’ t you grow?	396.2003237932424
asked Blazes Boylan.	3894.732543785572
That is to say she.	789.1390061869117
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	29116.639876123605
He pitched a broad coin down.	2824.4774566521223
Coin rang.	14887.63821703105
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	1612.4030999096399
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	1985.7701817105265
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	865.1253405326207
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	1140.8138457618484
Not on my own, you know.	697.652241586023
Fancy of a friend of mine.	1278.2267143863648
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	1370.7901801485157
Idolores.	11695.605131062071
The eastern seas.	5679.927086214844
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	1627.2168218635059
Clock clacked.	21818.673176800712
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	2012.247586923597
It clanged.	8202.946107253194
Clock clacked.	21818.673176800712
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	1688.2267283620843
Look to the west.	1125.6739126141115
A clack.	6729.382459240637
For me.	2028.9068951328798
— What time is that?	191.02395261548438
asked Blazes Boylan.	3894.732543785572
Four?	312.115515936975
O ’ clock.	1446.2859103345613
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	1192.2111375051873
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	361.1156555688244
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	2503.708562457942
Be near.	4741.517990954748
At four.	4044.392449221924
Has he forgotten?	492.60949930942
Perhaps a trick.	2639.6490951750034
Not come: whet appetite.	7213.678792139247
I couldn ’ t do.	900.5435145690985
Wait, wait.	1537.4373207195395
Pat, waiter, waited.	1268.3528083051638
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	5830.011610988328
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	1141.015936379232
There ’ s no - one.	814.6863341544696
He never heard.	1779.4786786971422
—...	18788.198812957176
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	1459.3648573449473
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	2023.332314349848
— Please, please.	1287.57514487915
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	7003.289579943499
— _I could not leave thee_...	9963.606431152428
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	5269.057772645716
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	713.0126607573105
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	1398.120580605184
She looked.	2583.8066351432285
Quick.	5846.311267724853
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	5090.892621273363
Sudden bent.	16111.380004218207
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	7348.372676076289
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	716.866970535616
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	1462.920164133492
Delayed.	21558.06072352106
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	2243.1731165842566
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	1991.203799627126
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	3627.9411989611485
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	3578.826377724032
Trained by owner.	1626.6623098724594
No sawdust there.	724.4417321183088
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	1472.015575841592
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	917.6246421981474
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	1238.3968490275338
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	2773.279403413752
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	1424.9079207473876
Yes, bronze from anearby.	2634.8751884292415
—...	18788.198812957176
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	766.1558074281211
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	2447.107416998565
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	1191.849053418669
I wanted to tell you.	847.6676556234984
Tom Rochford...	32634.02912893699
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	692.9376982155884
Lenehan gulped to go.	3905.116128148235
— Got the horn or what?	354.3048383527808
he said.	856.4235297911396
Wait.	4301.167531310137
I ’ m coming.	973.845267482188
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	309.58359272672135
— Eh?	244.8296642096275
How do?	268.9943987208262
How do?	268.9943987208262
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	1628.6216092734046
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	1014.1073752786448
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	1459.9777497476994
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	1358.4841984007962
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	2864.7646650918227
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	3457.931793336016
Come on, Simon.	1015.1036785854684
Give us a ditty.	3515.784000219158
We heard the piano.	1647.7820959275502
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	2138.25134599614
Power for Richie.	2490.0987350808246
And Bloom?	165.40631831985522
Let me see.	1882.9636447660928
Not make him walk twice.	2568.831813654965
His corns.	769.7635805516346
Four now.	3639.3992748939345
How warm this black is.	1992.0210502859884
Course nerves a bit.	2654.6195484228138
Refracts (is it?) heat.	1425.621236383705
Let me see.	1882.9636447660928
Cider.	15787.963800563719
Yes, bottle of cider.	1148.865635825416
— What ’ s that?	121.33936717810553
Mr Dedalus said.	1331.3949844220363
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	708.2679321926936
Begone dull care.	11827.91358447937
Come, Bob.	1535.1907894518588
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	760.4498619968363
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	2251.5106260847724
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	10143.978381766767
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	3877.9348022447907
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	1899.4523361183005
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	976.4775056209878
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	1743.9735294167567
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	1277.3402194211108
He ’ s off.	591.7514054012809
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	3448.2341273721804
Jingling.	11695.605131062071
He ’ s gone.	750.7435407819711
Jingle.	5798.655857615648
Hear.	5659.915422629268
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	653.3793874727313
God be with old times.	1232.811970714088
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	1209.517019596426
Gone.	5762.592979701144
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	1175.068671716099
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	1669.2766980349809
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	1555.8528419894806
There was.	1499.521394330004
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	840.6238393971723
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	1412.306535981635
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	1338.8282944148364
— God, do you remember?	238.97798302307223
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	2602.4991006409264
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	2490.0466103436397
They laughed all three.	2182.344714446021
He had no wed.	1632.5955017180052
All trio laughed.	10411.130599128468
No wedding garment.	4862.449057244788
— Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	539.4198988502604
Where ’ s my pipe, by the way?	225.83556280346642
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	581.3402234240605
Bald Pat carried two diners ’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	2756.696983608901
And Father Cowley laughed again.	2797.295272467421
— I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	308.70590416708814
— You did, averred Ben Dollard.	1884.1917372617206
I remember those tight trousers too.	2167.248115120167
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	1054.1024586648864
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	7099.34113458373
He saved the situa.	3061.1614154889303
Tight trou.	18354.158958401753
Brilliant ide.	50041.95876441744
— I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	324.219664929368
The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?	867.245102345351
Do you remember?	389.75776877356816
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh ’ s gave us the number.	826.7940454078165
Remember?	300.69501025033634
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	3048.2058586603753

— Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	442.31770464995634
— What are you doing round those parts?	574.0761784379853
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Devil a much, says I.	564.5601427199292
There ’ s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane — old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him — lifted any God ’ s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop - of - my - thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.	1218.3974737057156
— Circumcised?	691.3922142010439
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Ay, says I.	599.8679703350866
A bit off the top.	1197.7952130325584
An old plumber named Geraghty.	2894.9595634071597
I ’ m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can ’ t get a penny out of him.	547.4782242637224
— That the lay you ’ re on now?	257.8721588059333
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Ay, says I.	599.8679703350866
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts.	2705.2216323132598
But that ’ s the most notorious bloody robber you ’ d meet in a day ’ s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.	722.1969677730833
_Tell him, _ says he, _I dare him, _ says he, _and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, _ says he, _I ’ ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a <URL> And he after stuffing himself till he ’ s fit to burst.	657.0333462863832
Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out.	972.8416746828715
_He drink me my teas.	2943.434310091069
He eat me my sugars.	3217.1720508163476
Because he no pay me my moneys? _ For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of <NUM> Saint Kevin ’ s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	1089.3944602905294
Geraghty, esquire, of <NUM> Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	1023.4188510903442
— Are you a strict <URL>.?	428.8505032819917
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	1198.6786599025727
— What about paying our respects to our friend?	383.77450181776123
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Who?	168.13827833536334
says I.	1078.6465721370337
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	356.03364544020087
— Drinking his own stuff?	738.5223578681187
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Ay, says I.	599.8679703350866
Whisky and water on the brain.	1725.2717970893866
— Come around to Barney Kiernan ’ s, says Joe.	866.9903126947502
I want to see the citizen.	633.7492700157007
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	724.341266360012
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	982.3960795331758
— Not a word, says Joe.	701.6831896332811
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	688.650162424759
— What was that, Joe?	153.54519245914975
says I.	1078.6465721370337
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	1076.0965445075135
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	638.6895183552815
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	749.7060280292077
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	600.2712890477422
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	760.4047400164202
For trading without a licence, says he.	1347.19020726012
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	789.5365313760749
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	3371.9881845191776
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	1706.490524079622
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	1256.2766548942914
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	2143.4433483431208
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	2440.1175440976685
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	1183.35887773725
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	2688.736599893863
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	2226.0846237442556
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	479.2614545171571
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	2390.1781833092273
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	642.9992404229973
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	537.5037038215204
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	1274.1499119948012
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	1176.5969499473372
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	806.8452416537325
— Stand and deliver, says he.	330.7396669533439
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	451.614231872483
Friends here.	8738.629001338191
— Pass, friends, says he.	750.7205838252094
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	295.13119717997824
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	1762.3180333805165
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	681.9261721528701
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	582.3320719791079
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	712.1641035564295
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	882.3529195199857
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	986.622344862478
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	761.3827423845557
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	534.6458364707432
— Wine of the country, says he.	444.7897587881485
— What ’ s yours?	226.7904542155049
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	2526.412114519842
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	1032.642172345163
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	241.1683293216161
says he.	1080.34130870042
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	1537.8578551907199
What Garry?	655.5740766041632
Are we going to win?	578.1333139793393
Eh?	290.7036277742018
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	654.0830238748857
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	13781.345276447257
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	2542.840237480263
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	2479.2946396279162
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	895.7266784527371
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	2433.8846206157546
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	2184.296269214173
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	3556.143844305664
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	4434.428562486169
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	2990.7788567068696
Fursa, S.	3493.46334749232
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn ’ t, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	901.6537214635956
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.	2360.2505768367605
Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O ’ Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O ’ Sullivan Beare.	3086.743912335611
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	3216.314203820942
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	1292.4703344147895
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	611.2486687351
A goodlooking sovereign.	4079.219172227203
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	418.4495290740516
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	783.7406212843607
says I.	1078.6465721370337
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	1257.8001049478194
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	1579.5196045196878
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	712.8702757788005
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	905.9090683359872
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	399.15810380623174
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	1111.238843560355
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	554.4441681886141
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	1077.434282739263
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	1287.3048931839041
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	1068.618396627008
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	524.60857654026
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	1659.3564457087766
How ’ s that, eh?	185.10544887252652
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	3202.669119234795
Eh?	290.7036277742018
Deaths.	21558.06072352106
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	3484.976452653052
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	674.0024195679299
— Cockburn.	4898.022657539966
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	1823.4912099997123
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	583.0199086726815
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	784.9549063872453
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	729.3503937387454
Drink that, citizen.	1126.9596433916734
— I will, says he, honourable person.	515.6092285229595
— Health, Joe, says I.	719.2019024135813
And all down the form.	827.9989684748537
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	842.8856546908811
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	878.6629897230725
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	919.0587281143413
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	908.5903366036503
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	1022.191709556624
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	750.3807594324946
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	1339.6564324564645
I thought Alf would split.	2268.63487891897
— Look at him, says he.	496.8707032583485
Breen.	5311.502829530915
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	1204.0569954510252
p: up on it to take a li...	2824.9275435334234
And he doubled up.	1327.3101106276001
— Take a what?	226.21556873591535
says I.	1078.6465721370337
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	1323.4240563028811
— O hell! says I.	797.1824232606145
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	751.9055663373317
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	2820.006029696297
— Who?	168.13827833536334
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Breen, says Alf.	1078.3857910906988
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	600.2787396533436
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	817.0112921879308
U.	5539.721006328676
p: up.	1571.1828904161757
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	540.7409886279811
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	580.2427701233958
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	621.1838057593687
Is that Alf Bergan?	657.4527685462267
— Yes, says Alf.	843.9398109357106
Hanging?	34.901215494472076
Wait till I show you.	1568.3147499365218
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	2980.2202146303352
You should have seen long John ’ s eye.	1234.6361563967912
U.	5539.721006328676
p....	74114.85069549983
— Who are you laughing at?	341.3675279358949
says Bob Doran.	3875.7644325953274
Is that Bergan?	438.6820289942279
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	964.5186004054287
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	2785.5925042116232
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	1575.825846086113
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	839.8349899834902
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	1062.6492201516999
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	719.620294265009
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	517.3707322482742
— What ’ s that?	121.33936717810553
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	1178.3054271238136
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	947.8407945017508
Hangmen ’ s letters.	2991.444233817876
Look at here.	2143.1118766804157
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	864.321451141696
— Are you codding?	677.7266899142742
says I.	1078.6465721370337
— Honest injun, says Alf.	3198.3451545167923
Read them.	3172.388366680675
So Joe took up the letters.	1457.4910713050365
— Who are you laughing at?	341.3675279358949
says Bob Doran.	3875.7644325953274
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	574.5282837270487
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	490.7670730507863
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	573.5167541031526
Only I was running after that...	4250.919384906127
— You what?	191.0078736548335
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	1002.6344875671167
With who?	266.2969741932025
— With Dignam, says Alf.	1061.279030223739
— Is it Paddy?	339.1242585634157
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Yes, says Alf.	843.9398109357106
Why?	190.44911106412906
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	248.20160077148833
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	1749.6459958044732
— Ay, says Joe.	919.4234263529167
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	1078.013125295871
— Who ’ s dead?	218.51777403522868
says Bob Doran.	3875.7644325953274
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	757.183713098619
— What?	128.22159737738772
says Alf.	2758.333600193879
Good Christ, only five...	7340.3666374158565
What?...	11077.880001816828
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	1512.5912002531618
What?	122.71942533465327
Dignam dead?	412.344376105606
— What about Dignam?	298.3657776891513
says Bob Doran.	3875.7644325953274
Who ’ s talking about...?	3367.8395346377047
— Dead! says Alf.	1552.6603448969945
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	736.0525751170221
— Maybe so, says Joe.	419.1059790080158
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	1894.147862617611
— Paddy?	225.93769381656384
says Alf.	2758.333600193879
— Ay, says Joe.	919.4234263529167
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	996.6084463465196
— Good Christ! says Alf.	1651.8704166375564
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	2509.461062252042
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	1520.1499655456942
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	2397.0584426881824
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	1874.0362533674152
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	934.1621425170515
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	2004.3786057629266
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	2421.2317635239256
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	1385.4729124336648
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	925.7066404648162
Mind C.	5219.831706609309
K.	5678.285904035367
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	1236.6607050422153
J.	2953.906025021904
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	725.969978038606
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	728.2208565579939
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	1456.4469849673435
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	1283.6800440970771
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	1038.124815606886
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	1785.842055577412
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	1302.7640889492336
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	464.3769913951686
— Who?	168.13827833536334
— Bloom, says he.	414.80136584518806
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	695.6621391481746
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	1023.5356050890445
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	7182.541953936916
Faith, he was.	1084.3537162659843
— Good Christ! says he.	1033.7917732298213
I could have sworn it was him.	1054.5514878879167
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	465.8872900978529
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	1475.5768700444373
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	645.5973058224413
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	581.7805610688088
He ’ s over all his troubles.	628.5374743688574
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	1610.035260497386
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	612.6200064425249
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	691.4516769685692
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	1511.4601125349766
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	932.2316285085464
Talking through his bloody hat.	2118.1043939293586
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	960.3158269903585
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	657.7101890977846
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	840.977998186249
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	1042.4053456878007
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	1907.8140538342714
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	361.63323045164213
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	689.9470400852442
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	672.0907191051265
Listen to this, will you?	235.7422092494212
And he starts reading out one.	1440.8393575832613
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	2757.6901902633576
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... _ — Jesus, says I.	4196.608670281787
— _...	8302.34190810159
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	4897.310858085212
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	1510.1915054888843
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	1262.708952377757
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	787.7876552033672
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	511.80009849624145
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	734.0172740449025
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	1216.3922046705875
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	1161.661224701861
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	1087.7493010944902
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	982.0700468156501
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	863.8307869045864
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	1934.4308904508127
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	721.2952667506555
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	856.0187600504738
— What ’ s that?	121.33936717810553
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	937.5056092727169
— That so?	192.87747994220763
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	687.9214495223241
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	1185.6708062473922
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	579.2277009570258
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	1225.720938920129
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	950.505482687736
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	846.9850661696173
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	1022.670171355852
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	1367.4759085973024
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	1029.047326666298
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	4761.628041181417
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	965.2070517263536
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	1231.9056902341579
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	841.3677190788414
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	1471.6454594395873
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	830.8600683976924
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	1262.5911115765227
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	571.3519538494583
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	1056.7278786199108
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	1309.043332588359
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	850.8934528722018
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	849.5261602468911
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	617.6120099008587
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	806.7531141943789
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	996.0976262934192
What I mean is...	5927.504492853868
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	1302.157897436537
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	1427.8713313310504
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	1507.376742815115
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	2728.918083742582
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	2878.4515287918393
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	4714.7741137555195
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	2256.3345943009554
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	3401.785591574526
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	2081.3630405380495
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	2385.8044203558065
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	4098.269840967276
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	35856.26169699489
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	3885.002120659843
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	1232.9361187621842
O.	2152.5665654701224
T.	5268.119875574054
E.	5027.68337428093
I.	1229.9747499913867
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	345.362414513312
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	1336.6644069364065
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	1822.4951070518575
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	2592.913573141157
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	1804.2934749496894
O.	2152.5665654701224
T.	5268.119875574054
E.	5027.68337428093
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	3297.1179612984515
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	2682.9410465967535
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	2895.1362165048276
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	2213.350064757416
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	2310.7158348184544
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	2446.7189552572354
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	1115.8099776070428
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	1439.4355703937217
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	1807.1852128419378
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	1677.1483972726835
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	1432.5078360467119
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	4028.9680017280907
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	2178.265414825475
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	1462.3415812952544
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	1794.2907412072407
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	5112.8695342622495
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	1905.6995070551427
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	938.0943462320939
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	1099.0811942797598
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	925.6022931352647
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	2679.0688125439065
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	1045.6239957790717
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	988.9515007085043
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	2405.3526585441273
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	2109.564094129124
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	934.7961550493422
Antitreating is about the size of it.	1151.4781073908252
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	834.9563683835567
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	1072.9891297145946
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	3193.1709617959323
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	1327.2191681366253
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	1628.2657884265336
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	1156.158112587157
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	371.23973577461356
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	1281.8111777526124
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	181.39277346091163
says the citizen, jeering.	1272.3428325298785
— No, says I.	476.86276941436057
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	1717.181966996315
So he calls the old dog over.	1144.2191357504323
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	214.73278556849502
says he.	1080.34130870042
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	913.7920490650718
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	1653.9141409951933
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	1334.4754378691898
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	1127.9270906124045
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	1458.6879791717993
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	1234.1494424493646
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	1945.2727945849244
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	2607.1192998211745
O.	2152.5665654701224
C.	3903.316026160732
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	1947.8878897809238
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	2090.8977764463903
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	2109.0990033479516
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	1760.2726881819508
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	2377.5043639862324
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	796.3216280225694
And Joe asked him would he have another.	1043.2823362034123
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	533.7651842494281
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	603.9852185035016
Entertainment for man and beast.	2682.5229991578663
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	582.2005664213564
— Could a swim duck?	615.0834549710991
says I.	1078.6465721370337
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	881.173408257195
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	646.4730038921384
says he.	1080.34130870042
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	476.2465626908934
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	658.3208063251375
Martin asked me to go to the house.	651.9088200456043
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	706.0983925807235
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	847.1392660820184
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	506.79938772646506
— Whose admirers?	228.3887564266651
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	568.0020596177513
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	851.8140982036826
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	3997.3692112375466
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	3154.1922651935784
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	826.7578559646187
Choking with bloody foolery.	10298.207754184024
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	870.6981421079366
Shake hands, brother.	2830.01581005737
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	794.0312606853099
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	660.1648640285027
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	1532.1712955542116
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	964.4837512974907
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	634.364725663605
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	1181.0203072423824
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	846.0371443216217
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	3878.0169420796296
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	1824.3208736164856
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	1404.2625763440428
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	887.7221198549965
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	786.5867349983969
_How is your testament?	1768.1103471738975
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	995.0517166088949
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	566.8924206997737
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	1949.1459739288716
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	554.7841718947144
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	1318.1085830220368
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	733.3054909568552
So Terry brought the three pints.	2516.246210548001
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	852.4721522585146
Here, citizen.	1394.4459922470394
— _Slan leat_, says he.	2249.6438267951085
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	719.2019024135813
Good health, citizen.	1913.2472985168083
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	950.1547079334129
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	1772.5363637070786
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	487.10699672600055
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	1322.5927165424823
— Nannan?	476.8796238379752
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
The mimber?	826.6388591687563
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	985.9373059996132
— I thought so, says Joe.	641.644317317891
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	968.0670749091327
P., the cattle traders.	3855.3228636942954
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	742.9056691267176
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	1085.5671296470177
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	864.4878970792108
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	946.1476500043982
Mister Knowall.	50041.95876441744
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	2966.4933987652907
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	800.3604850739753
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	1356.963070695421
What ’ s your programme today?	410.6558047038806
Ay. Humane methods.	37069.46528215832
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	1415.3192921194707
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	897.0558185696282
Klook Klook Klook.	7925.948143496153
Black Liz is our hen.	7525.851086701935
She lays eggs for us.	954.4207814351391
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	1001.447376472928
Gara.	13137.782459902772
Klook Klook Klook.	7925.948143496153
Then comes good uncle Leo.	4454.716118130165
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	2091.8239010107422
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	63216.436950232885
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	290.3082880016156
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	308.14787002032216
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	490.4561139331196
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	514.7058590200863
I wanted particularly.	2557.718335572529
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	2975.666791339916
I couldn ’ t phone.	1842.031167641273
No. You ’ re sure?	1131.082494426002
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	852.4346318969231
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	1476.4435431395843
What do you think of that, citizen?	227.43375597539762
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	2990.9163690529126
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	12855.308655044868
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	1777.9264770913592
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	7861.160971648713
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	995.9086171752014
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	1117.5589375310096
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	874.2743367669119
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	5229.245090460597
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	1580.1807484933533
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	1976.8390616409615
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	772.6001233504363
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	9186.042995388938
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	2238.61113064811
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	1860.253977098239
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	1110.276896328504
There he is sitting there.	1174.572620364039
The man that got away James Stephens.	1804.241833200604
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	1496.1851021502512
What was your best throw, citizen?	428.6241672845199
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	1427.778332876924
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	647.2731683986353
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	633.6042170417269
You were and a bloody sight better.	1132.5168563232319
— Is that really a fact?	371.70772174271394
says Alf.	2758.333600193879
— Yes, says Bloom.	607.1114309057953
Did you not know that?	283.474993910548
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	911.5025818375502
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	871.4788209400829
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	739.9079686650133
Do you see that straw?	417.459064087112
That ’ s a straw_.	1313.5673364314166
Declare to my aunt he ’ d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	1215.9425663201532
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	1238.096524115621
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	673.410277101889
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	2044.082923892883
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	1208.5139714478146
L.	5104.02473378521
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	1856.0756052890758
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	2311.625471167244
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	2397.269102999953
The proceedings then terminated.	6736.323633783633
Amongst the clergy present were the very rev.	3151.6471879472097

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	871.340966887342
— No, says Joe.	730.8921680052043
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	923.0126468769965
— Who?	168.13827833536334
Blazes?	261.18605811084586
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	679.6364984413327
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	827.819526971476
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	721.25503924465
— We know him, says the citizen.	524.165133201983
The traitor ’ s son.	1549.8132437597615
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	1411.5296769256759
— True for you, says Joe.	701.0957479586689
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	514.9270362878995
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	1590.3505238637083
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	868.1809356560265
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	1502.539366252965
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	979.9048901634688
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	1453.7692166260847
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	1103.0843593965908
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	3236.2903855403124
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	2013.265204260077
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	1256.8045315803215
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	1087.0346874152274
The men came to handigrips.	2609.1731550749105
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	1241.964381191135
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	1278.9068841921635
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	470.1479365817761
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	3510.3168657120864
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	2664.264675371795
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	1538.6525533204351
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	3035.980671337253
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	993.123034701309
— He is, says Joe.	528.1338321872036
Isn ’ t he?	229.78014585836803
— Who?	168.13827833536334
says Bloom.	1549.9633438287228
Ah, yes.	1248.6539845102454
That ’ s quite true.	1228.955045707212
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	585.6000737187719
Just a holiday.	3441.3998927028165

is the bright particular star, isn ’ t she?	437.2552817984658
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— My wife?	301.77295536365125
says Bloom.	1549.9633438287228
She ’ s singing, yes.	689.9807370436755
I think it will be a success too.	846.1570857203351

And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	1071.086255667203
— Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	1264.3768578918882
God, I ’ d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	715.3830293257571
— Was it you did it, Alf?	259.0270181075765
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	1018.7753217006891
— Me?	246.38505732332723
says Alf.	2758.333600193879
Don ’ t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	2329.6831681992007
— Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	1044.3096927768734
— Of course an action would lie, says J.	1338.3385802822013
J.	2953.906025021904
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	4920.570593442733
U.	5539.721006328676
p: up.	1571.1828904161757
_ — Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	1366.6765964477356
Do you know that he ’ s balmy?	356.4390840437547
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	978.2014917597929
— Yes, says J.	718.4111070870989
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	1095.7896643337015
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	1033.101512418683
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	397.8057774300425
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	593.5291450122138
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	1952.9865893942795
— How half and half?	323.9921642117046
says Bloom.	1549.9633438287228
Do you mean he...	7019.538175920661
— Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	612.4791953305534
A fellow that ’ s neither fish nor flesh.	1529.9544530322476
— Nor good red herring, says Joe.	2446.1085092008893
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	856.1941541138552
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	2181.1898680586655
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	1081.4431733647073
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	1319.8298276585042
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’ s was pewopener to the pope.	891.2581788555217
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’ s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	1087.5948053056886
And who was he, tell us?	229.98266222443203
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	791.5675963353177
— And moreover, says J.	1473.5052703068582
J., a postcard is publication.	3093.087246460349
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	3157.176389594705
Hole.	21558.06072352106
In my opinion an action might lie.	2893.334441867956
Six and eightpence, please.	1537.9419545492012
Who wants your opinion?	829.7189674728288
Let us drink our pints in peace.	2685.94095862039
Gob, we won ’ t be let even do that much itself.	1075.924303440507
— Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	731.4722277503552
— Good health, Ned, says J.	864.9427675930935
J.	2953.906025021904
— - There he is again, says Joe.	659.8838172775107
— Where?	177.19740132368815
says Alf.	2758.333600193879
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	613.2904144172672
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	539.1723571661256
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Remanded, says J.	1673.3056087213145
J.	2953.906025021904
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	1767.5016195236055
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	375.387791641471
Course it was a bloody barney.	2241.0895928331206
What?	122.71942533465327
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	1485.7538667792683
J.	2953.906025021904
J.	2953.906025021904
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	937.7773684682487
— Who tried the case?	357.3177514851048
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Recorder, says Ned.	1934.8024870508136
— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	665.3580456118699
— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	537.6326957249379
— Ay, says Alf.	1025.8072009015282
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	1010.8833860752319
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	1131.9849877540378
Ten, did you say?	283.5401680708756
— Yes, your worship.	966.8379551819554
And my wife has the typhoid.	1762.628810856539
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	1392.0999794050383
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	678.0721053255752
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	1109.7799885245852
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	880.6384041040473
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	1527.879480728234
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	1321.410795063371
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	622.9588966732047
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	500.809805715293
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	1359.0630992871315
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	897.100525497916
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	2592.44748077807
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	1658.178249084678
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	1060.9053516093447
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	877.4461956675143
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	583.9465345857341
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	668.3320404710654
That ’ s the whole secret.	816.6751741002533
— Rely on me, says Joe.	1146.3409873445264
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	539.6910372284569
We want no more strangers in our house.	876.3462714764813
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	423.3911648591891
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	568.1767684775306
— Consider that done, says Joe.	1463.6315079196143
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	581.0569246481059
— The strangers, says the citizen.	293.86893924158153
Our own fault.	4538.419850142428
We let them come in.	1257.6380822168883
We brought them in.	1293.858771125002
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	3340.623248493732
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	2453.0219751043464
J.	2953.906025021904
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	607.1887264978461
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	524.8395029846606
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	852.3347682982147

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	814.2986493540016
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	826.0496144027138
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	301.64018930318196
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	1592.208300268234
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	1097.6655887156965
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	365.51815857763853
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	2198.50608790499
J.	2953.906025021904
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	1152.8288254474894
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	894.777599462761
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	1132.8627585640813
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	3353.7593288158473

You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	1047.7369333263541
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	1407.8929176951708
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	313.92134019182976
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	955.9932339943762
— Gold cup, says he.	855.8094779008593
— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	324.2392249468172
says Terry.	3292.715208308881
_ — Throwaway, _ says he, at twenty to one.	492.3214152605451
A rank outsider.	4163.448010496167

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	3445.367092730579
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	8314.608129754002
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	1372.7611252344057
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	1664.1984295367035
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	1361.8647005776006
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	3821.470275117977
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	2169.5494917215565
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	659.5590365162382
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	1646.486851476203
— And will again, says Joe.	756.3493638210856
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	492.6066403001262
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	1536.4115831130325
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	998.0335191215847
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	862.3273606892344

What will you have?	246.43666512102948
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	1030.7865377374933
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	529.7660114430307
Terry! Are you asleep?	685.8728659456518
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	652.4907564870401
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	4425.35569269938

Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	973.0259024833368
— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	436.2531659853689
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	408.3454481632283
Hell upon earth it is.	1881.440520432591
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	1382.437995389942
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	6525.054865916854
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	905.7348512757517
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	788.3767472681086
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	1101.2424952015135
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	1336.9593822258819
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	786.5727490157681
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	734.8699911815683
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	2302.132952466823
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	922.2258122444491
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	224.36011240129872
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	1656.9961020406233
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	1267.3783951905937
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	778.2460457751482
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	612.0263632681665
Didn ’ t I tell you?	302.73636446484727
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	1147.283637097883
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	944.3820217588232
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	1910.1435545480304
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	797.0719631445145
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	2470.10939334616
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	5390.059774481938
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	2435.7518973053952
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	1732.035157201878
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	1750.0945448814243
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	562.1737184474423
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	1570.5731937082478
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	1384.6029731832334
But my point was...	7219.981062561921
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	616.4128551881344
— Ay, says John Wyse.	1157.4563300545697
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	3011.440740228125
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	4647.921270294939
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	1528.493663536226
Fontenoy, eh?	770.4441581261555
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	1690.5160033559036
But what did we ever get for it?	429.8825480047971
— The French! says the citizen.	747.951389997486
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	729.9323711646832
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	2846.630176169582
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	3878.1029578495645
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	826.3871056443941
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	832.9525605541727
— Well, says J.	788.1068801866712
J.	2953.906025021904
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	2706.9448187413777
— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	473.58508331082896
Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	1242.8900127075826
The earl of Dublin, no less.	987.0868619035838
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	792.6869999898248
And says J.	1625.4026277395114
J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	6116.099419669971
— Will you try another, citizen?	447.0893435250609
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Yes, sir, says he.	397.61822332997787
I will.	1200.429911246102
— You?	139.47075814161732
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	566.9302284621141
May your shadow never grow less.	4176.21378371503
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	2082.890218697318
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	399.0687588353364
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	25608.77232844166
— But do you know what a nation means?	479.9900250276523
says John Wyse.	2745.571601445505
— Yes, says Bloom.	607.1114309057953
— What is it?	149.07323958384464
says John Wyse.	2745.571601445505
— A nation?	289.1285680629674
says Bloom.	1549.9633438287228
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	938.1453840987414
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	422.882315122053
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	745.6569262518793
— What is your nation if I may ask?	556.6681013243151
says the citizen.	1005.1599002931466
— Ireland, says Bloom.	673.6269737304957
Ireland.	3820.8233752629094
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	618.0095494926492
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	639.9157430214491
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	605.5115809547617
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	1199.5589599333755
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	5766.437056466061
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	1284.9010370430287
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	1911.5575921404998
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	1535.3512779988107
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	1148.2041563233204
— Show us over the drink, says I.	636.8625010732898
Which is which?	330.773029203745
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	310.74896144613774
Also now.	3450.4919906152186
This very moment.	3378.8432180819173
This very instant.	3899.8781987573375
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	514.7148479536462
— Robbed, says he.	1150.517533256032
Plundered.	21558.06072352106
Insulted.	21558.06072352106
Persecuted.	21558.06072352106
Taking what belongs to us by right.	1583.609983024662
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	1282.921248100858
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	495.613787530714
says the citizen.	1005.1599002931466
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	974.270010550952
— Right, says John Wyse.	1205.4905579282638
Stand up to it then with force like men.	1040.0664338585943
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	1258.801014584767
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	5725.886970777161
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	1529.1478974023305
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	603.1383144070985
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	910.5348379855583
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	438.824703726023
Force, hatred, history, all that.	1153.284124552751
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	887.198638355626
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	597.9615360016818
— What?	128.22159737738772
says Alf.	2758.333600193879
— Love, says Bloom.	755.3409177885802
I mean the opposite of hatred.	1276.4856387390455
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	682.5747215830737
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	713.2998990817681
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	710.9525299572363
Just a moment.	1758.7969336737408
Who ’ s hindering you?	493.7323824736804
And off he pops like greased lightning.	4659.5536665243
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	966.4486654568648
Universal love.	9798.24097856232
— Well, says John Wyse.	1058.1084911365672
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	924.0122466974151
Love your neighbour.	4040.2611356289385
— That chap?	295.74291938217203
says the citizen.	1005.1599002931466
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	3712.543492380595
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	1495.1142249234044
Love loves to love love.	2464.6109222724713
Nurse loves the new chemist.	5225.760288098786
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	1636.4865244909063
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	1433.2889630438633
M.	3454.822785535615
B.	4668.207229408097
loves a fair gentleman.	2439.7926357070364
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	3669.406792636501
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	999.681155053317
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	2218.983216766288
Mrs Norman W.	7537.927486626713
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	12493.520305347714
You love a certain person.	1857.329882655245
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	3036.7917035341397
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	566.3612654353657
More power, citizen.	2154.387974057008
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	804.4724818967063
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	1377.18247799477
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	1380.7638620302262
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	1302.9634509385385
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	1177.1004847790068
— What ’ s that?	121.33936717810553
says Joe.	2277.3720054515725
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	1604.7679122045072
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	1045.488256215139
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	2137.630870415099
— Widow woman, says Ned.	1579.1041119076092
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	1012.2159595618596
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	799.8016262132228
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	1034.7039806056155
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	9562.805564194296
— Is that by Griffith?	352.28478880218944
says John Wyse.	2745.571601445505
— No, says the citizen.	505.30270992604517
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	2240.1684931027253
It ’ s only initialled: P.	1385.0590832338823
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	802.8180456426928
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	411.36624265462933
Trade follows the flag.	5761.277642750434
— Well, says J.	788.1068801866712
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	2054.4091862238947
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	370.26876981128197
— Casement, says the citizen.	1091.1841944306834
He ’ s an Irishman.	854.0192310607113
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	279.38217246241743
J.	2953.906025021904
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	1114.6806886826407
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	352.42250404687235
— Who?	168.13827833536334
says I.	1078.6465721370337
— Bloom, says he.	414.80136584518806
The courthouse is a blind.	1807.7085696042843
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	583.7833392462894
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	1359.921238059377
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	473.7924094541579
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	436.18744849672044
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	746.7751009242193
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	442.8034776872562
A dark horse.	2616.858362310469
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	613.983140967618
— Mind, Joe, says I.	516.4592952415699
Show us the entrance out.	1625.1022695176746
— There you are, says Terry.	775.864555177405
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	1985.8265893327386
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	885.3520544734315
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	1303.6660224429565
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	6676.787044496359
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	1524.2955331924022
Give us a bloody chance.	2214.227484707003
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	1748.5458681023476
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	3547.3338482465706
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	1452.0776897566502
Loans by post on easy terms.	5297.683471933851
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	1695.4062585894012
Distance no object.	7973.9609558787
No security.	7401.601577408157
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	871.7461444478062
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	454.99741167793405
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	437.20590565842076
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	1261.38716228551
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	8138.4902945824215
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	566.176786189971
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	3279.5719100927126
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	2233.429991766095
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	1118.980512382638
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	2872.373521981135
Look to our steeds.	3761.4962168501097
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	1052.376774218832
I know not what to offer your lordships.	1582.799209857926
— How now, fellow?	233.0178782016648
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	744.5639809721108
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	1596.5209668394912
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	1476.4917848140656
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	1225.4760347555148
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	1517.1911047411238
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	893.3311060012958
Hast aught to give us?	1098.2552482131232
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	1256.693026647975
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	2748.8879443832247
That likes me well.	2281.218374027301
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	1366.5114182245484
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	1850.941823757894
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	1501.356054958002
— Where is he?	176.07995606084225
says Lenehan.	2434.3783346060186
Defrauding widows and orphans.	15329.970659205068
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	417.2071822957092
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	490.5692973001354
Or so they allege.	4798.702784448078
— I, says Joe.	516.3491367458533
I ’ m the alligator.	1100.5696335874297
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	454.41981764455886
— Why not?	213.09969827386473
says J.	2080.9158907505434
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	581.5063263047572
says Ned.	2682.945956012325
Or who is he?	257.48569329245646
No offence, Crofton.	672.8184834714701
— Who is Junius?	711.0797164414498
says J.	2080.9158907505434
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	1524.2599613163616
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	481.8231402966212
We know that in the castle.	745.1360323301782
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	342.11437325727405
says Jack Power.	3187.9788187441673
— Not at all, says Martin.	668.0169158985121
Only namesakes.	16523.415154956747
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	670.3083382176419
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	948.5502867073313
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	363.1784644636292
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	1112.1252753349693
For that matter so are we.	1403.1097616784764
— Yes, says J.	718.4111070870989
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	788.5716568852843
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	533.4416443377439
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	1366.398674627005
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	503.7409523803787
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	1531.0147206836443
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	7768.618017629692
J.	2953.906025021904
— Do you call that a man?	261.09023142326305
says the citizen.	1005.1599002931466
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	614.1184782993466
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	1111.041454367745
— And who does he suspect?	183.80108671643558
says the citizen.	1005.1599002931466
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	611.1511101558384
One of those mixed middlings he is.	2026.9277084385167
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	1154.5827239257917
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	390.97616593959106
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	423.19936316001764
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	1154.9593053863641
Give us your blessing.	3261.1967361833463
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	1037.6593807832023
But where is he?	231.57969860675868
We can ’ t wait.	1389.7952339224064
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	750.9730466229043
That ’ s what he is.	495.9690574093145
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	1259.8390587879142
Cursed by God.	5316.3033099761415
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	526.2914770473261

— Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	969.9423558350219

And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	1433.257329554257

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.	6368.528738959859
And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	1629.6850250028272
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	2389.2165528620685
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	1168.1558268984313
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	930.3294599656069
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	864.6321704318434
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	12912.19073502231
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	1170.6980404390004
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	1103.667027030879
And butter for fish.	2328.113185254193
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	725.9357619119721
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	428.3432073796026
I hope I ’ m not...	3121.0519115696234
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	664.6007206255266
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	1892.7068916802252
Mean bloody scut.	24070.83724404411
Stand us a drink itself.	2408.182387454666
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	763.1024369886718
Cute as a shithouse rat.	6643.52428809582
Hundred to five.	3657.379309039907
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	710.3841570694178
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	782.6543331660662
Come along now.	2660.7672161105306
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	641.3403011575458
It ’ s a secret.	712.8709806988294
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	1750.297267802765
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	2100.419734155456
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	568.3973409303794
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	553.222942000427
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	2137.3576582788273
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	1276.2944154155443
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	927.6455815823412
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	811.4760809553807
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	731.448116614604
— Let me alone, says he.	703.8965509758679
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	826.41548663596
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	1199.8405213050569
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	710.1874264151589
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	708.3186957192523
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	539.7725539351447
Your God.	3526.8710713845408
— He had no father, says Martin.	678.6019931473469
That ’ ll do now.	1084.121194046967
Drive ahead.	18805.655811000855
— Whose God?	97.77602789116439
says the citizen.	1005.1599002931466
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	445.67369179154707
Your God was a jew.	1406.7208396909177
Christ was a jew like me.	1068.5593696866665
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	1061.197163473451
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	972.8678019741104
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	957.0841875288369
Give us that biscuitbox here.	4010.657239812321
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	1413.2991852017894
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	4122.280081089722
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	1469.847955318765
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	2493.7258923631366
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	1621.7119405060744
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	1489.6956184770465
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	5311.349250820433
And Ned and J.	1241.3138825059534
J.	2953.906025021904
paralysed with the laughing.	1910.395182764402
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	611.7818515388125
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	564.9012721337834
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	638.5058515493295
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	1633.6120320404132
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	589.2801907743329
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	1584.1445816760113
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	941.4431433463459
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	551.9176103965888
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	1283.2313359442046
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	1950.111294490499
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	1084.3053560193866
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	4006.520955133021
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	1489.8214483320708
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	7159.7862631224125
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	1808.4655849021208
The work of salvage, removal of _débris, _ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, <NUM> Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	1749.8118287250725

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he ’ d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	1022.7084248733519
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	1282.0701777330582
What?	122.71942533465327
O, Jesus, he did.	497.94584748860467
And he let a volley of oaths after him.	1375.4240033078672
— Did I kill him, says he, or what?	229.21723347656138
And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	762.7397339353051
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	489.1451212968529
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	936.1027206687452
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	781.3320201984429
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	1118.8025702906
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	2449.8610081261877
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	1050.2281266800308
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	1210.259366230015
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	1245.8234390263665
M.	3454.822785535615
S.	3386.8216662258314
Belleisle_ printed on both.	6344.016521843503
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	1852.0054591239332
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	909.458582089347
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	1533.1695682027564
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	1490.1228914778912
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	1675.3137132454424
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	929.9153234879875
Say out big, big.	1422.0747120214724
I want a drink of water.	798.3727494157887
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	2989.5840901140336
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	1623.3033115167511
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	1033.4455309774085
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	2449.3610626819363
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	1358.1255147014463
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	1871.2509326278932
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	1164.1305318200054
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	2384.1583426742227
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	1555.2489188601764
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	1492.7249050511118
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	1433.7299600323379
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	883.9540650659374
Wait till I catch you for that.	1007.0582507108192
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	1547.1542139347764
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	1256.1507943207048
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	1009.8070836104849
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	1031.0170044348772
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	3074.0331425792515
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	834.6170255159573
Butter and cream?	803.5509969344214
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	875.8985502094282
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	3110.0046124869427
Cissy queried.	5664.342100460217
— Nao, Tommy said.	1457.653517572374
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	1636.3895650549714
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	913.597953964894
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	1428.395465301817
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	1121.151728817041
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	1213.4077007022233
But who was Gerty?	365.045845683758
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	902.4146374875176
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	1170.0876278937046
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	1573.735927277274
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	2091.9934898797355
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	1715.0293952638451
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	594.6017382761106
No. Honour where honour is due.	7597.159774668467
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	5002.624594495534
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	1531.97209912317
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	819.6885695679402
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	991.9688260512982
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	1908.11445962132
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	4026.3035448628457
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	1481.4229840993091
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	786.7262962507253
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	1463.8157230791987
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	1716.075452553134
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	907.9454043923164
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	1426.700820446389
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	1470.4787898812156
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	2320.754447982631
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	1417.1094220263883
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	1993.4704485032125
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	1176.203451214818
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	928.1945024430692
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	650.9795411918584
E.	5027.68337428093
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	2305.3315676426955
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	1784.9847568627863
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	926.1526809542183
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	867.4082097019466
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	544.5949931657351
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	1097.3417261107397
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	1565.9426532147197
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	1930.1877138522118
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	1312.6151880533882
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	693.668750924224
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	1901.2692886719337
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	3896.651925141059
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	719.4631273557504
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	1754.7248770845847
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	724.4550974423529
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	1205.9550566171251
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	1036.7887997509408
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	591.1719010824893
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	5739.321230801103
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	1276.8399010175392
C.	3903.316026160732
D.	4919.984217529489
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	1253.3114720164913
He was too young to understand.	939.2118537400663
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	753.8337022540832
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	792.1115932953753
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	821.416757089128
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	1801.2115131578387
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	590.1558628312563
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	874.4938993287153
It would be like heaven.	1581.8823284339715
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	4133.065762026604
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	848.301332120545
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	1020.6570104090854
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	635.934259324521
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	1271.9519523604831
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	1300.3971891824901
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	779.8799368310124
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	628.612151302115
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	534.2819260473096
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	484.68884211500404
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	939.2815218516339
It ’ s my ball.	946.7930380774371
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	985.1409422944
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	826.4071512038449
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	868.0693914307493
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	1620.226371192204
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	365.23899328311614
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	2742.016834358013
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	1176.3837319983
But not a pin cared Ciss.	448.8970980451774
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	1109.0934359326443
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	560.3694571559371
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	1651.6624453233032
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	1065.5906507587013
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	1006.7249329148334
That was just like Cissycums.	2865.468494690384
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	623.2787283021192
There was none to come up to her for fun.	797.122814158996
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	1249.2282106278847
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	888.7675431985227
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	623.5212226342701
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	2219.2348758496414
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	1070.6504484820666
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	1091.9826045826412
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	1241.906864910285
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	2532.6292244957813
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	550.2102537094572
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	1802.55262708218
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	1071.0289089157395
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	719.2131949466951
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	1284.8620861650338
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	639.1998709059105
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	990.394505262651
Now he was laid to rest.	1148.3101572059443
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	621.4312228049545
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	1082.5877224430558
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	1527.37293149514
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	1003.3321927072701
You could see there was a story behind it.	890.7024183827178
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	816.5131493814977
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	1358.8783321458286
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	1910.413245228904
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	1611.7273152427576
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	2274.271253395384
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	1058.3030249131307
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	1711.2997698768618
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	3006.6860973296766
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	1392.077750646128
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	996.070778165931
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	1024.8013750316798
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	1304.0495171002487
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	2387.2269046729407
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	2631.496456961614
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	679.6916133126755
— Say papa, baby.	1737.326717233142
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	9233.74501521898
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	636.7246096290874
— Haja ja ja haja.	34262.76488650271
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	1065.4473616078205
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	3390.509599623272
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	925.0396316587352
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	820.754533422309
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	1740.126490534335
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	3084.079036809738
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	337.644487433512
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	951.3994200584684
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	921.4368301246578
People were so queer.	3155.646352233401
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	922.6465794147689
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	539.4047287303562
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	980.0017476583561
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	617.2796244484082
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	1087.355749728606
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	1104.291844524177
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	979.7447791416405
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	527.8622962984001
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	1722.909712964121
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	5335.940811772641
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	923.7141904664245
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	1052.9186404528475
Refuge of sinners.	12206.593312296927
Comfortress of the afflicted.	3413.8765134339014
_Ora pro nobis_.	6972.274646667332
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	1269.0040402721852
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	675.1113218263785
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	1155.7479649257791
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	507.3650850473863
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	898.5304937826405
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	1581.7297417305099
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	11476.180567054567
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	656.8352048979913
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	924.7111664604492
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	780.0024984065569
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	850.0870140622064
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	831.3872537429893
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	1482.3777715832568
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	1309.2757719328495
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	936.1392770060801
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	593.1757113473449
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	976.0806660981171
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	1169.4543047325574
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	730.6960445368879
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	1017.7552514407247
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	1279.95106751175
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	1752.6773497679965
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	609.1718426521264
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	1302.4976919873013
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	1183.9252397423027
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	804.441508034107
— What?	128.22159737738772
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	2127.474778371435
I was only wondering was it late.	1265.2000301469639
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	1283.60406553915
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	746.6551192305978
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	1033.195687225722
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	706.0974855305799
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	590.9243564819259
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	2532.285111644448
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	1168.481951663042
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	703.8837584672581
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	1350.2130198061618
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	888.6967610007435
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	763.1279606281331
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	512.1744566422142
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	779.9417032069786
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	2527.518416625788
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	785.58033168125
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	540.7297081937985
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	1063.5717874267311
Gerty winced sharply.	3829.9749176306236
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	2278.5904985279362
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	1203.4728749539827
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	1158.2972929490932
She had loved him better than he knew.	1391.5936870729836
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	1183.9607954321107
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	1629.732205363409
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	534.1222130130817
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	616.4526227283654
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	1978.9968290242875
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	635.4267465655661
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	1094.351452850067
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	955.3842642295945
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	832.5883524905263
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	1087.5081242134677
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	1058.5738032010688
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	1872.8978618296658
He has his bib destroyed.	1063.120146102193
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	2603.604483789946
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	1072.0175945399437
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	966.5989519707612
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	1702.7920127934838
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	1072.2103579408888
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	849.2654370781364
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	1016.2123572995476
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	1059.3669783895525
But it must end, she felt.	1030.178704058629
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	750.2325557068083
Love laughs at locksmiths.	8032.521610299361
She would make the great sacrifice.	1987.4072550359303
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	983.6109574818778
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	1324.5405146690998
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	602.1144257461983
But even if — what then?	392.43316996668256
Would it make a very great difference?	675.8351692599398
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	7416.510197485925
No, no: not that.	483.04385238799546
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	1054.977737934738
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	915.7403551926527
She thought she understood.	2430.5885922048897
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	1466.90837827646
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	1075.8428806700288
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	362.71684397924867
Nothing else mattered.	12372.103374002898
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	1476.956924734242
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	1238.4526725690296
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	794.2432620838384
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	711.4119079528658
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	747.7983007972424
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	963.6120421293704
But Gerty was adamant.	4681.520259483394
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	1467.2232009805161
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	1287.5607357390065
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	3454.3501533284893
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	555.1559881982765
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	645.8969282358604
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	834.5064369022962
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	1227.5537362070286
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	798.2136084118011
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	799.049252562029
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	855.4299175568715
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	521.8823343390641
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	791.1267935288963
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	907.2562049773
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	996.2024289724922
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	1159.0858087184406
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	1255.29472149032
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	1104.796967006451
What a brute he had been! At it again?	415.375401820471
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	481.4064654522418
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	861.5502892844803
Should a girl tell?	827.737959691074
No, a thousand times no.	956.6023438525265
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	899.7208725878667
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	968.4811362343268
Come on.	1743.2814679461444
We can see from farther up.	1675.2782708627399
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	995.4164556261235
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	974.3861526207035
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	677.5109905885399
She rose.	2922.0324193777083
Was it goodbye?	506.25661828839566
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	811.6993050810527
She drew herself up to her full height.	1667.6770608649026
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	1394.1469911255997
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	1344.5317322440178
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	1073.7526887571003
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	1325.8528688476176
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	2153.7668319839267
Tight boots?	621.5715023119146
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	1557.7235482617061
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	722.4512112227793
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	1377.9874468933785
Jilted beauty.	15812.825431028688
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	1962.9330705375469
But makes them polite.	3105.8475456356427
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	777.4621236147792
Hot little devil all the same.	1555.0608667985655
I wouldn ’ t mind.	1081.8236943209126
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	1747.030516813089
That squinty one is delicate.	3562.6275759810305
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	2465.4907380471045
I have such a bad headache today.	1881.7068633451065
Where did I put the letter?	328.56279624993795
Yes, all right.	804.2494696299623
All kinds of crazy longings.	2083.782887626429
Licking pennies.	18812.731941147817
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	2927.0297095456176
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	1689.0935276471803
How many women in Dublin have it today?	597.4394997338567
Martha, she.	1069.4650203115916
Something in the air.	966.9950862018554
That ’ s the moon.	606.3059780930985
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	574.0882937550762
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	1211.9719780235887
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	1754.650716351126
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	3829.489485926114
Anyhow I got the best of that.	669.6748745508819
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	1093.2423223584028
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	1074.914401761458
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	2335.2344781512606
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	702.9687986653362
Thankful for small mercies.	14363.131660904874
Yours for the asking.	2344.146069553309
Because they want it themselves.	1900.2430432777394
Their natural craving.	13432.798848124829
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	1237.2434461717523
Reserve better.	13368.026504100422
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	763.0328297863394
Catch em alive, O.	3130.4637371696435
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	1438.7197771230726
A dream of wellfilled hose.	4384.780079817511
Where was that?	173.20378808280847
Ah, yes.	1248.6539845102454

Put them all on to take them all off.	837.3231757866548
Molly.	4058.063193947426
Why I bought her the violet garters.	1466.2963811695233
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	1535.074275933254
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	1157.732429457599
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	828.3871516129316
of jet.	1710.3472557860223
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	1962.7458606689959
Pinned together.	11959.65260385767
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	926.1625566652826
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	2492.7633995376273
Fashion part of their charm.	3362.4290872256884
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	857.8739716603624
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	1074.208141007859
No reasonable offer refused.	14478.187044897322
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	1092.545613693366
Always off to a fellow when they are.	899.9054215977084
They never forget an appointment.	4396.734089772334
Out on spec probably.	7125.90613790993
They believe in chance because like themselves.	1922.915203958676
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	1631.2875181295283
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	1512.208165734126
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	1921.0290047886037
Barbed wire.	18812.731941147817
Be sure now and write to me.	1168.3194589687528

Sister souls.	6536.164165139688
Showing their teeth at one another.	2948.2445177424784
How many have you left?	469.6201238260615
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	1836.3998998075724
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	876.6630751852608
Dark devilish appearance.	17045.58389955437
Scratch the sole of my foot.	1788.964726472073
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	400.793022554987
Good to rest once in a way.	890.1676414669524
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	650.6044525470969
Safe in one way.	1450.2195699465335
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	2553.5200828781944
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	1942.231179858194
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	1672.0794441954486
Daresay she felt I.	2702.213257349242
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	1223.62523665582
Liked me or what?	730.2745212214197
Dress they look at.	2888.2940070341397
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	3676.476376584517
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	2392.060757138757
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	4208.359908832915
Trousers?	34.901215494472076
Suppose I when I was?	236.01225480530522
No. Gently does it.	8287.330583501865
Dislike rough and tumble.	7284.241574481835
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	1093.7934355757204
Saw something in me.	501.7821916198919
Wonder what.	2916.329791022332
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	4850.561115617295
To aid gentleman in literary.	2755.1580755573036
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	2539.770993057373
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	1226.2616721937254
Still, you never know.	911.9898536934045
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	912.5807379239878
Beauty and the beast.	406.60094250097546
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	1020.0063201541501
Wide brim.	31633.267610030063
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	1164.9919409325462
Hair strong in rut.	1599.082291033201
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	1185.021489012947
Why not?	234.12745547535692
Suppose he gave her money.	1661.6548754756125
Why not?	234.12745547535692
All a prejudice.	4064.2320619727543
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	585.2161625193997
What?	122.71942533465327
I think so.	1236.7561290228862
All that for nothing.	1198.470138695264
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	952.7717352962735
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	625.2795825577291
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	946.6731446106788
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	1570.7789840056284
No, I remember.	797.980553250263

Shark liver oil they use to clean.	5079.514647451358
Could do it myself.	2178.0559144421145
Save.	5828.641383569536
Was that just when he, she?	243.12575016047927
O, he did.	541.6404272401209
Into her.	4262.147856744792

Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	2255.5856931398166
O Lord, that little limping devil.	2099.786229631442
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	3727.576367146418
Aftereffect not pleasant.	8572.132357881492
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	980.0207795655788
They don ’ t care.	1438.5498136792241
Complimented perhaps.	14627.575416550682
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	2378.0584074716003
Well, aren ’ t they?	364.3622773432286
See her as she is spoil all.	1379.7804911549879
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	855.6353240151063

Still, I feel.	921.6429165404829
The strength it gives a man.	1185.1129603839897
That ’ s the secret of it.	400.0400120832066
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	816.7840161477696
Cider that was.	2464.9501409104423
Otherwise I couldn ’ t have.	1576.7952181872236
Makes you want to sing after.	708.0388704094233
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	82940.96167887108
Suppose I spoke to her.	1106.2816084469844
What about?	186.60716037880732
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	1284.5026495788823
Ask them a question they ask you another.	1508.1748046287612
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	1637.7388220249488
Gain time.	9872.782612409905
But then you ’ re in a cart.	726.9775575464374
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	1395.9869929277534
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	2543.3614007101614
All the dirty things I made her say.	1034.0169578602743
All wrong of course.	1624.4712429854167
My arks she called it.	3486.4842731803424
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	807.6372463997536
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	1684.1468140297684
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	1102.5751522561293
Parrots.	21558.06072352106
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	501.01251395983445
Taking a man from another woman.	1394.8797728688025
Or even hear of it.	1196.3874265561299
Different with me.	2630.4321626700175
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	1059.8581744317694
Eating off his cold plate.	3942.2276929419336
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	2645.0544003279
French letter still in my pocketbook.	960.6198019952839
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	648.2764169581948
Come in, all is prepared.	727.9480712737975
I dreamt.	3692.826759410187
What?	122.71942533465327
Worst is beginning.	5324.7933905893615
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	805.162416304022
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	1544.0912331944346
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	1031.7614714328597
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	616.5869765155804
Because I did.	1630.8063616148809
She too.	1882.4985726903608
Offend her.	6742.465872461613
Then make it up.	1300.9450549123544
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	1684.649131109788
Flatters them.	8438.568535754393
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	1081.575142954039
What harm?	374.3007255258788
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	371.02377233993013
First kiss does the trick.	2624.4273213193555
The propitious moment.	4727.562217652327
Something inside them goes pop.	4579.385593103823
First thoughts are best.	3874.009551974688
Remember that till their dying day.	2064.308977601993
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	1439.7894024324155
But her breasts were developed.	2341.0143115310316
Fell asleep then.	7356.787707255225
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	2161.9733643965283
Featherbed mountain.	14388.582252198721
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	3498.726631047604
Val Dillon.	11201.691496868561
Apoplectic.	21558.06072352106
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	657.8855495914792
My fireworks.	4818.508556427092
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	1110.1376120028933
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	711.7719522705421
Want to be grownups.	3786.978197052302
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	1679.2313261190704
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	723.8731723558708
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	479.205754860075
I knew she could whistle.	1629.077472901859
Mouth made for that.	1464.5156869610457
Like Molly.	4300.989952790699
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	394.38466399695477
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	640.1867615250758
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	4039.626096720321
Caressing the little boy too.	2336.661063467751
Onlookers see most of the game.	2023.5883974971302
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	953.0510473021195
In their line.	2257.585457543056
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	913.9396846712029
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	1568.9723251607224
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	1784.4557536323916
Fine eyes she had, clear.	1308.4670940546935
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	564.7548338339211
Did she know what I?	324.9436602852626
Course.	5846.311267724853
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	818.7972895279885
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	1395.9386416095826
Call that innocence?	1009.3035965503333
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	1395.7936887300405
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	4935.660684732794
Eyes all over them.	1688.2374755246797
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	635.2858685247674
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	1510.3730903112485
Sharp as needles they are.	5143.372715186358
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	706.6563965358987
Had, too.	1207.447129152228
Where do they get that?	342.29062590103956
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	1472.6716739919668
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	795.3698495024892
Bred in the bone.	2490.2274122117205
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	1898.830354856032
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	808.9828437853639
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	978.8358816748055
I never told her.	1052.4452825293802
Attract men, small thing like that.	1952.488090269525
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	766.0602983447808
Who did you learn that from?	391.0871673459409
Nobody.	648.4142163114785
Something the nurse taught me.	2140.348485252134
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	876.2258480310089
Me have a nice pace.	2206.6876720120904
Mullingar.	5827.72223398114
Who knows?	393.59294241244436
Ways of the world.	1709.434261721201
Young student.	6556.61759758003
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	1676.334382823538
Still she was game.	1951.2194505832122
Lord, I am wet.	1171.6981524434893
Devil you are.	1922.0759518672749
Swell of her calf.	2497.798855891189
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	3578.1581132277297
Not like that frump today.	3691.546390637469
A.	2028.0615964047747
E.	5027.68337428093
Rumpled stockings.	14298.1640523745
Or the one in Grafton street.	439.0137168493846
White.	5827.72223398114
Wow! Beef to the heel.	3006.36163273237
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	4452.426481440084
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	716.509714083393
Will she?	288.9077402623963
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	2691.160155062354
She smelt an onion.	5000.677288260171
Darling, I saw, your.	811.9805657969616
I saw all.	1029.0458482334052
Lord! Did me good all the same.	936.340248208797
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	866.7439723893915
For this relief much thanks.	3724.719737350716
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	833.6205642168483
Lord! It was all things combined.	2247.5527041081136
Excitement.	21558.06072352106
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	1289.1640414044518
Your head it simply swirls.	4477.435960902674
He ’ s right.	643.8904914897753
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	1821.637184720847
Instead of talking about nothing.	2987.2336157219133
Then I will tell you all.	947.4309909666921
Still it was a kind of language between us.	905.6992491769645
It couldn ’ t be?	316.0804434960592
No, Gerty they called her.	953.2848837025458
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	1315.3946461169662
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	1611.8090584664692
Place made me think of that I suppose.	1194.403621194525
All tarred with the same brush.	2557.140832829993
Wiping pens in their stockings.	6619.414808435573
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	886.547047827403
Every bullet has its billet.	11244.192203678043
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	2501.8650565458934
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	2004.264171266475
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	1396.5132556964413
No soft job.	3725.789078755433
Saves them.	8438.568535754393
Nature.	5659.915422629268
Washing child, washing corpse.	4811.536333188309
Dignam.	3993.303581518857
Children ’ s hands always round them.	1558.3283137476233
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	2847.567074460454
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	2141.2333334132913
Fill it up with wind.	1952.627125660049
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	2103.882647182176
Must call to the hospital.	1246.1212096764814
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	2928.469517321672
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	1713.0633902055445
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	1187.3017032940152
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	1343.830945366649
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	1686.0415617588626
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	1959.8561455096149
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	507.7166653656301
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	424.6640114783353
Chickens come home to roost.	7137.771006201771
They stick by one another like glue.	2607.9667949715376
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	609.3968919379492
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	1743.3018596361783
It ’ s the blood of the south.	440.343523938795
Moorish.	5772.174644253341
Also the form, the figure.	704.9227167289241
Hands felt for the opulent.	1785.3091006079926
Just compare for instance those others.	1398.1559719307547
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	1754.4349712252592
Allow me to introduce my.	906.3156798081537
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	760.1281647277175
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	890.4352116711641
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	372.5448865561503
Have their own secrets between them.	2521.056517659681
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	1025.4039484155146
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	1429.3101043003917
As God made them he matched them.	2452.865586342062
Twice nought makes one.	6760.039311904834
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	3023.017168493499
Marry in May and repent in December.	1496.4941096490745
This wet is very unpleasant.	4342.067670080704
Stuck.	11695.605131062071
Well the foreskin is not back.	1751.202338461847
Better detach.	16190.153464254461
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	2159.2305347905644
Long and the short of it.	559.9536067784913
Very strange about my watch.	3094.324384129187
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	5608.662691763514
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	1039.4786619243205
Yes, I suppose, at once.	536.4589611207138
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	1296.1135626321936
I remember looking in Pill lane.	2778.9506905010558
Also that now is magnetism.	2563.3119067770267
Back of everything magnetism.	4578.595492469664
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	3134.840429110559
That causes movement.	1279.8459819331895
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	475.34204755545966
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	2287.446676402
Because it ’ s all arranged.	931.7357119106128
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	625.5476964656286
Little piece of steel iron.	3521.4403010174474
When you hold out the fork.	1387.3570321556606
Come.	3769.4841282972616
Come.	3769.4841282972616
Woman and man that is.	823.0321856329159
Fork and steel.	5649.2058967492385
Molly, he.	699.3417110674485
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	539.1839147274392
Tip.	15787.963800563719
Have to let fly.	2357.963286736278
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	1403.7310130238286
Shame all put on before third person.	2789.3186012419674
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	1170.797337671866
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	874.7799428700584
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	1835.6757866432017
Fine voice that fellow had.	1795.5199924372534
How Giuglini began.	10389.79897295787
Smell that I did.	1200.055961832717
Like flowers.	5168.184554487454
It was too.	1200.4700062591266
Violets.	21558.06072352106
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	3128.285269384611
Make their own use of everything.	2169.676012063298
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	1384.2018514684507
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	834.669190730909
Keep that thing up for hours.	1481.128994780648
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	778.2407788874223
Wait.	4301.167531310137
Hm. Hm. Yes.	23708.82538078786
That ’ s her perfume.	866.2193361814102
Why she waved her hand.	1741.5042979580237
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	578.2662782392528
What is it?	149.64377956376987
Heliotrope?	1160.373267622947
No. Hyacinth?	3818.8782320692353
Hm. Roses, I think.	5406.274979210511
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	906.4718366336722
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	2488.1151141737937
Why Molly likes opoponax.	8147.419374871391
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	1944.510135188081
Her high notes and her low notes.	2260.8885397112645
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	778.0196494638152
Heat brought it out.	3132.8663296498466
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	507.0197938885792
Good conductor, is it?	104.79088120072706
Or bad?	455.40877729625083
Light too.	3578.1282998860374
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	1388.005299661764
Mysterious thing too.	5562.627939834297
Why did I smell it only now?	468.6532652732973
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	1855.1114226095467
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	2314.9304930658955
Yes, it is.	534.8439888170233
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	3340.5490103962306
Tell you what it is.	937.7078398288619
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	817.6382782791376
Clings to everything she takes off.	3373.830009808377
Warm shoe.	1345.2833200383911
Stays.	21558.06072352106
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	1980.929018964711
Byby till next time.	5410.269086748869
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	1216.3187005440645
Know her smell in a thousand.	1313.0702473720164
Bathwater too.	9521.420078950294
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	1053.2588969768767
There or the armpits or under the neck.	465.2891732611231
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	500.38769692612084
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	2990.7839905874034
Muskrat.	21558.06072352106
Bag under their tails.	5317.555037848248
One grain pour off odour for years.	4293.488683431179
Dogs at each other behind.	3272.5666888175874
Good evening.	4324.887880144494
Evening.	648.4142163114785
How do you sniff?	800.5528941424516
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	7080.540534365598
Yes now, look at it that way.	620.6874820577797
We ’ re the same.	870.6119871961415
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	1338.664439270336
Come near.	3597.7558923536812
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	1819.8330724472326
Like what?	304.42583311735456
Potted herrings gone stale or.	2435.736190688774
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	3254.029949262647
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	1461.7459782244448
What though?	247.48994739914724
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	1714.649165230136
Breath?	849.7949504514035
What you eat and drink gives that.	1225.1795798356407
No. Mansmell, I mean.	4402.792273252504
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different.	1225.1107362785333

Or what they say.	1736.668591326722
Like our small talk.	4311.039687220767
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	1300.1471175926772

_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	1185.271541586814
Married too.	3492.222565896729
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	1091.6534190514474
No ends really because it ’ s round.	1199.2984202299322
Wife in every port they say.	2019.3454308326964

If ever he does.	1847.3646448152751
Smelling the tail end of ports.	4774.445506625289

That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	582.0033522721496
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	2063.8338182431544
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	928.6230353322152

From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	1588.3975855592118
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	1455.461087190343
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	1084.7940410549318
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	2127.9223901462988
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	2410.581332311473
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	1107.8981388268155
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	2077.687438435259
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	1827.7546957263426

Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	2611.010276503501
Don ’ t know what death is at that age.	953.2305482116855
And then their stomachs clean.	3545.4442110068726
But being lost they fear.	2408.451020793097
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	2931.288090912785
I didn ’ t want to.	709.8278043709635
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	513.6262141974778
Frightening them with masks too.	5077.270527878315
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	1123.372739199883
I ’ ll murder you.	905.361132311154
Is it only half fun?	690.9165658619838
Or children playing battle.	6057.105244449178
Whole earnest.	12659.564629404262
How can people aim guns at each other.	2008.5956949088622
Sometimes they go off.	3186.4035000644662
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	9188.224875142685
After getting better asleep with Molly.	3163.5469058305043
Very same teeth she has.	2701.0279049056244
What do they love?	347.3166167391979
Another themselves?	637.5343763009181
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	967.6883654001073
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	1395.6745198725594
I felt her pulse.	2794.2849487244125
Ticking.	21558.06072352106
Little hand it was: now big.	1059.883102227694
All that the hand says when you touch.	781.7936011574311
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	5051.930610227421
Her first stays I remember.	2431.583175737246
Made me laugh to see.	647.1407923643515
Little paps to begin with.	3380.837176423351
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	756.8917711141938
Nearer the heart?	654.965567584512
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	1982.5002526062792
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	1359.9883375808956
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	1426.906991273723
Brings back her girlhood.	1400.0966790317314

Looking out over the sea she told me.	1066.367497398691
Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.	612.9987791779158

Why me?	225.7865498096873
Because you were so foreign from the others.	1172.1527467091876
Better not stick here all night like a limpet.	2169.9650507958554
This weather makes you dull.	3797.9482070218537
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	970.8485080666619

Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan ’ s.	1791.207773149055
Got my own back there.	1850.2385845201152
Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince.	3216.6856419659925
Mistake to hit back.	3526.480504610146
Or?	220.25568993668784
No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.	2475.578299996016
Always want to be swilling in company.	2281.220957991508
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	480.4877086403232
Suppose he hit me.	2126.6609931147523
Look at it other way round.	1325.6253225252108
Not so bad then.	2147.777044147668
Perhaps not to hurt he meant.	1728.407966043133
Three cheers for Israel.	3772.7724104059803
Three cheers for the sister - in - law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	1422.3201237221072

Imagine that in the early morning at close range.	1719.3608547782653
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow.	1470.044909741994
But Dignam ’ s put the boots on it.	618.8889241680906
Anyhow she wants the money.	1713.4238173516237
Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	3033.7642935245262
Strange name.	4184.87128882179
Takes it for granted we ’ re going to pop off first.	1789.850746403068
That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer ’ s that looked at me.	1202.396906528816
Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium.	5483.068513166279
Her widow ’ s mite.	2544.0088485241718
Well?	200.2722160773838
What do you expect her to do?	341.5318245384663
Must wheedle her way along.	3838.5640214724904

Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	761.1647781321029
He brought it near his eyes and peered.	960.1166594756729
Letter?	629.5217235356969
No. Can ’ t read.	3359.60700851345
Better go.	3650.604896414301

Who could count them?	578.4362968549676
Never know what you find.	1824.596320516844

Murderers do.	9865.795462092288
Will I?	210.17866927551648
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	1449.538937781007
Write a message for her.	1264.3275572332798
Might remain.	6481.119094737601

Tide comes here.	7806.246628476942

Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	995.488280416209
All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	2196.992435312163
O, those transparent! Besides they don ’ t know.	928.0491433599523
What is the meaning of that other world.	651.2801157391668
I called you naughty boy because I do not like.	1076.4647814717969

Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	1653.529957009882
Hopeless thing sand.	10654.622359994939
Nothing grows in it.	1692.3997411896398

Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn ’ t.	722.6715216706476

We ’ ll never meet again.	1659.8479481997863

Half dream.	6683.649945697919
It never comes the same.	1336.9249540005717

Here.	4163.460194123237
Far in the grey a bell chimed.	1818.4299170965112
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	1199.6158790063732
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest ’ s house cooed where Canon O ’ Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	1005.8939731195038

Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	725.0465445874179

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	3063.627346040072
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	2062.017818448752
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	1330.0122064589696
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O ’ Shiels, the O ’ Hickeys, the O ’ Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	1346.3424249585735
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	2021.885709431681
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	1901.2277378408805
O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt! Before born bliss babe had.	1368.567953057935
Within womb won he worship.	7064.600922685479
Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was.	2945.7284239914848
A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.	1923.7542111313985
Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night ’ s oncoming.	2700.3945608082445
Of Israel ’ s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared.	1468.291076934
Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.	3463.8420530344556

Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God ’ s angel to Mary quoth.	2908.815048227016

Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred.	6088.967386030937
Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.	8524.020809480508

Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland ’ s westward welkin.	8992.976820976093
Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	3252.371088455029
Christ ’ s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	1631.2916726209537
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne ’ s house.	2137.906293120536
Loth to irk in Horne ’ s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	2795.9858978853244
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	2679.0139703770187
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	994.5569072296369
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.	947.2272004804179
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	2880.670639935836
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	7496.238385109531
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	2149.9987802074206
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	1522.3940035418861
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	963.9869074742375
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	2399.79119497442
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	1307.9173012961044
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	1217.2701030614546
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	1377.9478222517473
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	2963.735949316477
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	805.2856163151075
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	628.4161123557602
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	835.0243610106472
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	1119.4986968256853
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	565.266324045039
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	790.3760954100479
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	21096.25610305014
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	1309.723177974327
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	1857.6215894113805
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	1554.876502217344
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	520.403252206587
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	1035.251566568455
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	1408.3489655518606
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	1135.8814247962976
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	1233.0908425883833
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	1309.6708271656257
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	2690.02418943412
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	819.7516684287759
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	2771.6025484764955
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	1920.3904924596775
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	1359.2651562292315
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	1174.7258251867654
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	1113.3662564433666
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	1485.147985316963
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	1610.5677868104517
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	733.1893975273844
Thanked be Almighty God.	2149.358817209603
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	1403.9488752416264
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	698.6263258814589
Meseems it dureth overlong.	29174.981195614015
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	896.9213316295694
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	840.1917263411322
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	1137.88109504012
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	853.3258974254646
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	1372.3100964500734
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	2493.5700358680915
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	1085.5103377214857
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	856.1769574681167
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	1299.4920690931824
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	1455.3577167063197
For they were right witty scholars.	2681.823968918446
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	1177.6481127436268
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	798.0796683799467
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	1380.2138009721516
A redress God grant.	9531.74394824189
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	1157.159172271506
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	1206.3125802389663
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	1938.6761954227322
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	3440.098976938975
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	2241.9219072278274
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	1134.0455424239553
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	875.436827420342
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	1306.5215032979356
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	3357.44885544593
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	1257.9226450206133
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	1549.8311229157976
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	1958.8091491613511
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	1067.3743034652182
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	1331.169823124763
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	1638.0849964897632
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	1036.613356078803
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	786.442568858119
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	736.7996175212606
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	1235.4860530717983
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	889.1434973011443
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	1562.5378756317255
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	1744.910131775991
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	2013.8664687337964
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	2316.4101708580292
See ye here.	4342.835216322652
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	631.978431260175
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	2386.94360791222
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions.	984.2233923909382
What means this?	412.3651259562081
Desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	1561.666528289569
Mark me now.	2318.776272620165
In woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	1045.5549458578798
This is the postcreation.	2612.884198889691
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	30329.476755550942
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	1946.6868497783096
But here is the matter now.	982.6360115372138
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	1343.3097546378135
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l ’ avait mise dans cette fichue position c ’ était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	17443.36756049751
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	1364.0850571777025
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	1482.124066863513
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	2821.871084459562
With will will we withstand, withsay.	3787.449532140199
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	2015.6479374698524
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	1475.9548525246823
In Horne ’ s house rest should reign.	2027.1268898390747
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	1407.4511497548206
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	1518.1915796025417
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	471.95369621077043
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	2535.64618284675
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	1955.8033328027377
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	8242.90259540523
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	1264.2456696295308
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	888.7051408972319
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	779.9113088278641
Go thou and do likewise.	3470.9463044119834
Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden.	1578.2335081752976

And all the people shall say, Amen.	953.1131608711842
Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	1283.5189357699464
Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	974.3127440705506
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	2113.952816528426
Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	1117.0111320787803
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	2273.754433173447
And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.	1120.0882802785036
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell ’ s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.	1499.901031960957

And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.	1961.610963812686
The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.	1169.123194560491
First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage.	1600.0293132896243
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	1933.3127759353158
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	3014.375139894685
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn ’ s bivouac.	4540.864966638985
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	1182.0021155993234
Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	6277.045721303414
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	2361.725710635937
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	2571.6807559611943
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	1527.7053117842192
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	1093.6172395994006
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	2057.2597415851556
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	1359.5783953893172
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	730.8574907027106
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	1162.9321757130745
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	613.4253311478354
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	883.9235660955744
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	945.7398298191032
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	1352.0297927382258
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	375.6783582674476
Heard?	629.5217235356969
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	732.6385287555656
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	414.3782043644969
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	484.8432935876404
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	1258.4861184868644
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	1161.8301024098341
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	818.5006134672141
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	1259.8402298075953
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	3205.0362892496864
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	1349.8251558624233
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	13725.700225862056
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	1988.0175205530563
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	1845.6114733579382
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	2269.1571568663185
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	1088.8314252391913
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	1063.3289453915233
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	1468.660867144491
Over against the Rt. Hon.	16316.198556976613
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon ’ s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal.	1093.312794552177
Mulligan a gentleman ’ s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore ’ s the writer ’ s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	871.6949674322378
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	628.8883539306566
There Leop.	9315.964840610943
Bloom of Crawford ’ s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy ’ s, Vin.	1762.817134379934
Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will.	1319.5577729557563

Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.	1759.2585935768823
Leop.	15787.963800563719
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	733.7275815299719
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	778.9243059302595
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	1787.807457776496
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	1279.5633390481808
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	629.198206121078
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	972.4894948332834
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	1266.3082893741903
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	782.5807990940181
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	472.9894810708508
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	520.7178650682845
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	1050.0212469554156
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	1723.4978632976456
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	1369.0453474816745
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	1002.7333827737609
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	283.77899967367296
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	383.3281351697178
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	1132.8139358692536
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	2137.279156745322
I question with you there, says he.	452.4476829711084
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	2200.3326727708545
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	1247.69395885273
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	1207.2941169388225
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	1095.3907837623933
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	1172.886591505837
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	976.3705754221453
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	550.9516579444091
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	1289.5415079114946
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	638.7620887053799
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	686.646957251629
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	735.5332894036304
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	891.667057544154
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	692.0870176000304
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	1508.6730414960118
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	560.7781439887386
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	846.1928531023872
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	908.4202166207808
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	692.7449114261025
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	1132.8114922270777
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	714.6433537477104
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	696.326689999392
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	800.8888788851018
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	982.5714683891218
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	1077.1259972892021
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	1071.881860393569
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	1755.0661770195036
Fertiliser and Incubator.	12701.947107324491
Lambay Island_.	39616.09131016968
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	1107.9535730362932
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	588.0645032042215
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	3149.196017296623
Come, be seated, both.	861.8370549579482
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	2043.6865107467147
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	1398.7231050096245
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	1807.1760687042017
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	2128.9513423976223
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	1463.3451075688251
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	487.53147631925094
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	1933.6324849413113
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	3035.306880820588
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	1482.7418926116782
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	1244.9279651760592
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	1607.3263089862437
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	4612.6083375183525
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	1589.9170641263152
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	1005.9426071649284
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	544.9213411593718
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	649.8450298158234
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	1448.8051307699443
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	1422.8930097553848
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	1583.6835679319245
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	1033.3256545193435
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	1095.2369040068886
That you may and very opportunely.	2365.5666073580796
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	2968.2228187103756
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	718.6081858121158
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	933.7155781043173
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	985.8258725961084
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	633.5831014166341
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	1080.5947243013165
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	908.2197872799326
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	1247.219811439589
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	664.9401629447165
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	5415.385996236199
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	3923.4230503349368
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	572.9764976174322
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	1007.9554456869841
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	866.705810274585
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	1275.075473936376
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	1721.5482064239384
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	4223.549141254354
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	1231.0026786950136
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	1509.5034501437897
No woman of any wit would wear one.	1667.418665903046
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	894.087347886354
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	1393.1375401661865
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	1137.8836582192507
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	1984.3470800600185
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	1689.0477424343853
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	2488.7672955379626
What, you dog?	187.93627391839976
Have you a way with them?	252.4928663172561
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	1637.2079439262818
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	1038.442542465307
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	983.4984690826856
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	767.0789854929494
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	625.5333164866621
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	1741.9041250970645
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	892.1033060129218
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	983.5775204681903
I cannot away with them.	1176.2911828187127
What?	122.71942533465327
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	567.6619909782568
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	1368.8095592029601
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	997.7304214839107
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	843.5174007154765
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	1378.6360445492473
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	855.675829710487
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	1434.8006734460241
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	2721.2408396690666
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	1036.2201680171963
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	1827.3571835782225
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	1217.2197349623125
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	1648.5890321911725
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	1255.5900925435585
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	1121.3115930093504
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	1263.7150527412016
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	1154.5461382549508
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	1095.8537036285495
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	631.7095185011672
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	1872.8284694804536
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	1120.8662914061622
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	2219.915159597506
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	1460.6899165039415
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	1002.5561412412073
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	979.7033109378792
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	1264.895358753558
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	1395.1893106397633
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	788.0121337979288
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	914.4952556679154
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	2531.293642517357
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	1341.924110919275
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	1295.2674500495948
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	1139.4551513314907
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	3117.884620286731
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	3980.8663891399583
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	3120.9609757687745
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	2707.3406098407063
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	1258.9487567089072
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	1293.8643904113635
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	1473.5276403327764
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	1739.4659161670263
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	1846.151845727578
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	1587.6411780881108
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	1744.475365909294
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	1364.1664094303785
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	2149.062154325568
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	1715.4221674787213
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	3034.4135653161106
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	1438.6455513968929
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	2957.6531669614938
He conjured up the scene before them.	1631.5009079200167
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	2700.5079792970573
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	1050.6338339722988
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	1028.3469866409591
Yes, it is true.	741.7817956662883
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	841.3844486864184
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	2514.496202989502
This is the appearance is on me.	775.8819196441177
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	475.9929006175315
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	427.131424575103
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	941.6896399877978
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	1414.410078054394
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	4462.931259473101
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	813.7021421935303
He was gone.	1236.4282567147475
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	1917.86013950727
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	2106.6283891203307
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	2193.549577810718
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	2984.1165136468035
The mystery was unveiled.	3343.1278437361834
Haines was the third brother.	1447.0391394244011
His real name was Childs.	2406.245591697937
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	875.2435353986319
He drank drugs to obliterate.	1417.5117484204493
For this relief much thanks.	3724.719737350716
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	2838.77832890699
No soul will live there.	2281.285261161332
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	4746.979116530597
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	2440.1145735011664
A curse is on it.	947.0856873013772
It is haunted.	4952.36988177208
Murderer ’ s ground.	2351.181573497297
What is the age of the soul of man?	191.4565752718077
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	867.5397289668277
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	1451.3752905262238
A score of years are blown away.	1772.8982829597492
He is young Leopold.	1443.6459395162565
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	882.1287284225293
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	874.6820535387309
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	768.5596374062663
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	1016.3132662841806
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	1237.8886439813048
Who can say?	407.2486027835576
The wise father knows his own child.	2039.6084359394283
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	1086.0673396527566
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	970.9585253255264
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	1134.3429884717664
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	1232.1283991511873
Did heart leap to heart?	275.6767307027269
Nay, fair reader.	4257.997190373115
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	1592.2969671488988
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	537.2454466745953
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	2303.029921219832
No, Leopold.	1138.9306123690599
Name and memory solace thee not.	1993.093267071278
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	1078.3368929722208
No son of thy loins is by thee.	856.543167771373
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	797.2329460626318
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	1522.6231619249377
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	2435.4386667391
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	2437.7627094604986
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	2300.627470750735
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	885.0288494264403
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	1743.9077015060536
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	599.2436434124415
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	435.1981841311838
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	5294.336759494388
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	2528.7255984309922
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	2426.8345808133945
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	1829.1747106049108
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	1368.915345951555
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	502.9829828384695
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	374.0059627262998
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	1299.4915447893195
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	1157.8945197217865
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	1101.2097923299855
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	3768.9415760934467
Where were they now?	348.6025689223695
Neither knew.	9073.440886006681
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	713.7686154155574
Why think of them?	265.9532874989063
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	728.2019500934903
Who supposes it?	883.1969882873483
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	1965.3126143577113
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	2996.7695951189785
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	1274.5787748206578
All who wish you well hope this for you.	1301.5386895945487
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	1822.4385773788256
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	2326.1537420431096
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	650.8018640035955
Have no fear.	3500.9870063567705
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	2102.4958574394454
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	1134.9583418025
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	696.5160867084346
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	1242.4666534653575
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	1496.9545812622155
He told them of the race.	678.261741854135
Madden up.	2712.7307548759613
She was leading the field.	1307.8851656528411
All hearts were beating.	3809.111816187513
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	5926.973123128397
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	1456.6720239877618
All was lost now.	1592.9926718846384
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	3242.837297045105
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	1585.6008660775658
A tear fell: one only.	1659.0116615924992
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	1896.1520899416596
Lane.	5659.915422629268
Four winners yesterday and three today.	4540.563942714673
What rider is like him?	540.3992343598167
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	1468.9700434556605
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	1237.8673815805903
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	1331.195399713911
She is not the filly that she was.	755.2492943642916
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	1159.805249153829
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	893.5868821098877
Do you remember her, Vincent?	382.0703312081422
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	1182.0517765733443
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	876.7968277699754
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	2177.099758013014
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	2020.9129186890882
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	1038.7860348379781
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	1754.222457098025
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	714.3721417543297
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	840.1120594942284
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	1938.9412166400537
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	1759.1863221250935
But he had been kind.	1285.9647109040793
In going by he had blessed us.	1229.4749605691802
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	1132.8708615872263
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	1622.082207955327
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	927.5036630227884
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	4603.1793031786365
His soul is far away.	2031.7771375161221
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	1115.0570021347405
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	1674.344985767186
Do you not think it, Stephen?	254.24922493999773
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	2368.2685761307353
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	2819.4981399552867
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	772.9404846456363
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	2926.9397892994016
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	1611.2201723725443
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	1353.383434198403
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	744.7372948461389
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	1659.5114631980207
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	2688.062507731459
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	901.21504182937
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	1732.5966761591021
A gallant scene in truth it made.	1764.5707154129002
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	1025.1933454358261
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	1940.7346430855896
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	1464.1613276665857
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	1760.4767045000374
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	2039.8189147262249
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	1307.445186141276
Dedalus ’ (Div.	2204.211042479773
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	10793.418798204477
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	954.619976674141
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	1178.4005401665502
Bloom (Pubb.	3291.8839290779724
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	3580.156323572807
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	1638.3622112344924
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	1323.959131417655
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	2227.257071688028
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	975.9673701842518
Mr M.	2113.0066400104442
Mulligan (Hyg.	5261.206901965657
et Eug.	18288.327834398002
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	13905.028122031292
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	3685.9119488390825
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	2111.753976802295
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	1673.906863014317
Mr J.	1878.7934453076718
Crotthers (Disc.	7420.088661378373
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	2271.9350448273335
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	2329.1398177927194
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	1465.91131006772
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	2515.406211263089
Lynch (Bacc.	5589.540497623993
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	1767.1849727441038
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	1541.7103345569772
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	1357.1057273756517
Mr S.	2081.736598091955
Dedalus ’ (Div.	2204.211042479773
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	3302.917605374323
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	3073.3885294810025
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	2862.013279098647
Bloom (Pubb.	3291.8839290779724
Canv.) which took place in the commons ’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	895.6568729717679

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	1037.0078766174252
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	1552.0305866721296
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	1467.671215315386
She had.	1605.894960152115
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	1061.6106643238847
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	966.8440460343282
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	1080.384983013952
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	698.7467591007115
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	1092.6882239960682
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	997.9275508271585
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	1242.3048315145038
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	3743.685713833083
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	3608.621147638241
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	1508.0749311441152
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	892.7525957979182
He knows and will call in His own good time.	997.8724204423992
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	1395.8519950428104
Sir, to you my hand.	652.2198557380417
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	979.2777219170603
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	1068.9883229562931
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	990.7671995647241
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	1056.2544459361445
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	1259.062055309634
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	909.8846092363405
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	1286.1733606490982
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	1676.5018294359627
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	1939.5660833427532
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	1809.124734333648
Mark this farther and remember.	2398.9097738025716
The end comes suddenly.	2979.770221886661
Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.	2986.7442159589486
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	964.9249275243106
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	1767.125972358485
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	1752.2969398883984
Burke ’ s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not.	1728.2701849503064

With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	1317.319425464302
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	1470.4401687043544
The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.	1702.392688004634

Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen ’ s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute.	827.5448804310556
Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.) _ BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _ (There is no answer; he bends again.) _ Mr Dedalus! _ (There is no answer.) _ The name if you call.	863.8510198773457

Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.	978.6893612077035
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.) _ BLOOM: _ (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) _ Rudy! RUDY: _ (Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom ’ s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.	1152.3985703908472
He has a delicate mauve face.	1713.377119766106
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.	1824.7228485968476
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.	1318.2743150592698
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	2130.379566314041
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	1096.416570617614
But how to get there was the rub.	1019.5075237204294
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	2745.3398783103135
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	866.9231693956544
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	1434.4368296880084
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	755.9904269620629
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	1109.0182120388483
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	1326.2030704573353
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	2431.6656438780924
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	1560.0930806711067
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	1250.5342090827648
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	430.55603284042706
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	1022.1071810115859
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	1151.2752019879124
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	532.9746321264236
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	854.9763035131085
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	2963.126696134199
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	1140.7067692619173
s.	1279.478060725364
d.	3463.712087416958
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	1056.2040453424206
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	1697.7332639409428
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	403.6178393635746
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	1617.9962185097577
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	465.4791118180846
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	1011.276940157382
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	1227.442728027315
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	793.0814707706701
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	1480.5845147403854
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	2913.5831201197566
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	2096.387058829632
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	998.1772285240066
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	1683.4878051990488
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	2066.2054381894714
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	879.0807984591252
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	2364.2088128495416
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	2315.3481489486626
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	1013.7731220432192
His friends had all deserted him.	2437.4873819828713
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	1253.2183283191946
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	434.6242317881574
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	778.0256797306829
Anyhow he was all in.	702.8139392416113
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	623.3129836892991
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	740.4387842927752
Try it.	2361.4495778114797
You may mention my name.	2558.1088895548646
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	593.4415291488974
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	691.275002374768
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	1135.5499126496704
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	884.7871444190091
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	816.5218843276656
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	1441.7767914858794
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	471.2202574381267
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	1012.2700360695577
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	1948.3936938618776
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	612.1757719420833
Whereas.	11695.605131062071
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	732.4628750710291
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	1009.5729197698099
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	1102.2940593866679
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	2831.7102857931864
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	3012.988394002349
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	1220.4087136924672
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	579.0763423773487
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	1900.6431327563298
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	669.5973072379594
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	1097.8378956943598
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	670.2370586650976
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	827.386288842107
Who ’ s that with you?	148.48893211150522
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	784.0162777541252
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	744.8931113953385
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	752.1736430736503
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	690.3589048069732
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	1049.0193694574887
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	1363.879295618344
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	708.5616487497792
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	1261.6154469036771
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	2341.6377637911005
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	853.8247660432327
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	1603.3129198334345
Pretty thick that was certainly.	921.9938271988456
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	1081.1779706552193
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	585.0966663666755
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	851.8132421521394
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	1507.6934907465204
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	893.0767053980882
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	448.259144173886
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	534.9199339474741
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	1964.175571299535
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	987.5755411403633
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	1216.5070797564022
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	407.5377317156379
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	808.5499692642594
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	1646.3191940615202
Simply fag out there for nothing.	4135.784667690129
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	535.619124444506
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	616.3552171135682
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	474.91592565030743
Where does he live at present?	631.3550557066225
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	623.5312879317336
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	1037.3926458778358
Why?	190.44911106412906
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	729.9595339359388
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	990.6534604117113
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	935.0647720773784
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	974.5401344807892
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	774.5944817515664
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	902.8592245011778
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	1037.408319869488
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	1467.6494569110512
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	1105.5458659457356
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	1185.2119095712471
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	1367.9034329290828
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	2337.882674107068
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	2102.846622972112
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	4299.850188898074
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	4350.422183733263
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	2061.012918041321
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	2502.157816831336
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	1017.2850997347942
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	4683.872607426683
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	2936.8645728318374
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	900.6810145442975
I mean for singing purposes.	2025.2578177541716
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	584.5458279064513
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	4787.922893128896
_Belladonna.	21558.06072352106
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	1099.086718908668
They were haggling over money.	4201.029762840457
— Is that so?	223.95746714850742
Mr Bloom asked.	1465.5393185173311
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	1760.6904140756908
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	1528.1985784116737
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	637.5916127288755
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	1470.1711805339241
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	1150.9249828176542
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	3857.674149641055
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	1558.3638203802388
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	6622.482451738227
What ’ s in a name?	138.21295132430055
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	1160.221519845041
Of course.	3647.0034575076766
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	952.5231674818223
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	1212.517605058759
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	961.2892126474793
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	2234.5901493516517
— You know Simon Dedalus?	458.24450493950053
he asked at length.	1506.2317985065126
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	411.74591990342304
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	921.9361011343111
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	573.5318691538987
All Irish.	3060.700541641764
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	1359.8099642872405
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	651.6822318291621
The lefthand dead shot.	6613.335452610046
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	1422.0467776047547
— Bottles out there, say.	1322.7344590455193
Fifty yards measured.	4541.872298884004
Eggs on the bottles.	2455.046564436775
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	3141.1026681086983
Aims.	21558.06072352106
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	1177.3152506034025
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	1343.5631611147905
— Pom! he then shouted once.	1396.2599642765138
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	1285.3420173529182
— Pom! he shouted twice.	1674.5848304449112
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	1970.1926263195996
— Long ago?	460.62537487623
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	6105.715615309413
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	732.3771701991783
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	2872.0772504616775
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	1169.563857867816
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	1958.3442123857694
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	397.3843412149569
D.	4919.984217529489
B.	4668.207229408097
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	5551.688134746553
Know where that is?	344.6308346447408
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	2183.764181823773
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	1136.244598091328
That ’ s where I hails from.	1118.2390474002077
I belongs there.	1634.1958915003138
That ’ s where I hails from.	1118.2390474002077
My little woman ’ s down there.	908.1004447850697
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	451.1384801177019
_For England, home and beauty_.	3821.511279068416
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	691.0211331233244
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	1827.7541498666324
Across the world for a wife.	382.1328519859766
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	2308.3220514430845
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	2218.5073613603117
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	1730.9344954831345
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	773.8250006806292
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	1854.2058382346574
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	1117.572177760964
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	1228.4806424152468
No chair for father.	2060.0883614097943
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	3581.463469070544
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	931.9040351378804
Grin and bear it.	3109.514114297989
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	3219.160432083976
B.	4668.207229408097
Murphy.	5798.655857615648
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	554.48052611547
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	943.9354697955873
— Thank you, the sailor said.	560.0960101859986
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	1058.6548756824047
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	3078.964041442383
I shipped to get over.	1920.342354948062
Paid off this afternoon.	6812.96137660532
There ’ s my discharge.	1093.2313342144855
See?	238.69007649171334
D.	4919.984217529489
B.	4668.207229408097
Murphy.	5798.655857615648
A.	2028.0615964047747
B.	4668.207229408097
S.	3386.8216662258314
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	2466.4426403949774
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	490.9488420329384
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	1058.6356332495852
I was in the Red Sea.	721.0594699632949
I was in China and North America and South America.	715.3084021503
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	5783.520788307576
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	4475.549438849551
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	1309.1990111337163
I seen Russia.	5422.557664344012
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	50041.95876441744
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	1819.5913534275494
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	910.8094072079936
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	1345.4514404802337
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	2582.8117858735814
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	1758.1286256191127
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	1087.2557812829325
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	1388.2513320847927
Look here.	3553.8935796096443
Here they are.	1853.852859726548
A friend of mine sent me.	1496.6480928403212
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	1156.0246503277713
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	4039.193476220679
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	1545.7442671938636
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	4983.861031665299
Stomachs like breadgraters.	19955.105724150668
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	2706.8035364026086
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	3235.1815648910197
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	1934.1269252912618
— Know how to keep them off?	495.8535561333604
he inquired generally.	5058.213923752095
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	677.6217955082377
That boggles ’ em.	4691.723449968699
Glass.	648.4142163114785
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	2748.7403018001023
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	2805.025388626456
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	1733.7613497782984
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	2414.857507356747
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	910.890350520186
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	1340.3801234826803
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	2024.3344209592676
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	887.6214501938092
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	2266.1520692497256
That was the rub.	1399.2126291771067
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	1650.3654649161954
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	1603.863448508034
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	1482.7133425361228
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	1453.9620108576207
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	926.7008064668867
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	450.7698652112839
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	1000.2671552259346
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	528.3098240224937
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	3065.4828924610156
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	2793.480593739471
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	1314.3658289463208
Knife in his back.	1526.143842294599
Knife like that.	2574.55000571393
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	2123.4760096798263
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	2151.383011720633
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	679.5178794082659
Like that.	1840.9244268721798
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	2313.2571478102636
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	1132.037634046832
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	3729.1754822727266
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	1070.2341655707628
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	1955.5707190536805
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	584.9094794298225
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	1240.3623441428085
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	1098.4775828752097
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	1118.599488593269
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	2890.4186460794026
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	589.6973282897086
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	939.2606696003605
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	662.2499196237726
Give us back them papers.	2487.8673483308166
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	2671.748489497207
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	410.65349096994356
Mr Bloom inquired.	3523.7557776764147
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	756.0242740175498
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	735.8572117360943
— What year would that be about?	326.74166773398406
Mr B interrogated.	5869.5438535174635
Can you recall the boats?	206.22075015208898
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	847.6706506298227
Salt junk all the time.	3749.492032361308
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	1104.5285578835271
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	904.6370068397238
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	1092.8474140999244
And it left him wondering why.	2015.5644517361252
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	763.9577329384275
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	1295.94567860727
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	1028.8816426277208
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	967.5176948785102
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	1148.0560546632596
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	633.306932454461
I hate roaming about.	3682.3305945497764
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	813.342438767351
— What age is he?	243.6595206429601
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	1286.6110374733812
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	722.7213828191681
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	841.2994772102231
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	2253.303244860756
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	1169.017314720005
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	1485.4356062713662
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	1177.171794034391
I hate those buggers.	4050.68330950752
Suck your blood dry, they does.	2850.9729721914723
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	1076.5891978125196
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	2986.7522302706757
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	3417.749352686851
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	296.56447149965254
There he is himself, a Greek.	640.9522226674367
one asked the sailor.	1190.7281616350165
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	1401.374969284847
Someway in his.	2423.968028575708
Squeezing or.	7875.77724501762
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	731.1401850114639
There he is cursing the mate.	2218.7493774738323
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	642.2772206204404
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	1540.760784960877
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	551.7596687802834
He ’ s gone too.	760.3081344281815
Ate by sharks after.	7965.03356993805
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	612.4270531725227
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	1784.9986099591158
— And what ’ s the number for?	182.80178702733033
loafer number two queried.	7367.731919703205
a third asked the sailor.	1159.6777772593548
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	775.4640907569882
Ate.	15787.963800563719
A Greek he was.	1079.7591646516892
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	1873.2687324425428
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	678.8194909375832
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	878.4850668678951
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	2521.4057829796066
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	1125.5091200539669
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	806.382383175772
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	1304.006146396441
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	977.2920953688783
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	1105.6956060272048
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	1792.176357018945
Still no matter what the cause is from...	3534.275617487367
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	1342.8671073112157
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	1183.5022980603421
She is a bad merchant.	1416.5358872887614
She buys dear and sells cheap.	5844.989846468311
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	977.2325808690221
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	2213.766137617633
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	473.5972161997229
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	729.2283556804728
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	1148.5711605998895
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	1624.1442980910638
Do you?	206.9951996777496
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	1254.4784099283522
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	1708.1073832588836
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	1466.698036414478
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	1020.2757021224874
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	922.46524476534
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	765.4434285010992
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	1574.8122576402666
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	1582.7843736458067
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	1057.4411619610871
I ’ m not so sure about that.	702.1324595083794
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	895.9946218977669
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	740.6704395425708
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	308.25508733470656
Let me stir it.	643.1463357693228
And take a piece of that bun.	1251.0161002194257
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	725.2371007686115
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	1412.1932671667669
Try a bit.	1943.4671857908259
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	1097.8941273669677
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	1792.7311415849363
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	1658.9830765925794
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	394.37082514665167
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	1941.1102800457506
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	2789.5939125162763
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	895.7393380933233
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	1447.8445426584603
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	1280.3170566674332
You ought to eat more solid food.	2627.0498790899856
You would feel a different man.	1416.8432340244776
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	1227.7986632526286
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	1471.9868509998296
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	440.8455981179699
It reminds me of Roman history.	2072.1735523006205
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	1553.009149893949
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	2488.3262627735066
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	2015.3320243976218
Look at him.	1472.8325689576102
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	706.6362957767445
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	1061.127484691197
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	1993.074097653536
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	735.4257684103193
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	2574.5278827402512
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	1523.1370458526108
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	351.93041308069087
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	1992.0172062037657
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	1118.5203210048053
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	1080.0531108277837
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	1215.9703781940302
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	1424.9746812851897
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	1610.3162301776922
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	1359.9871152837952
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	1859.0598130064898
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	530.3972401889894
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	2963.939090845431
She has the Spanish type.	1769.1587773872122
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	2520.66078803208
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	3002.0287469412556
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	899.226414130735
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	1144.4208423377827
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	116160.61709332875
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	1558.7562327235273
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	2022.7559993134935
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	560.2947020555874
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	670.2865571470015
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	646.6567384163247
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	2100.035872038901
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	1441.0136477147735
An exception here and there.	2298.213906180984
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	849.7053620440047
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	873.2236618554706
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	751.8062810737143
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	1001.7264019116597
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	1268.2181422806239
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	555.9228949148792
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	1775.557869898036
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	1749.5624235598516
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	576.921688651314
s.	1279.478060725364
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	2096.7640909046577
No aid was given.	2543.2457494000955
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	1135.3956125604527
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	588.2007425017804
At this stage an incident happened.	5261.437770112948
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	2494.9280650747487
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	1579.8662462806722
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	716.5187727692899
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	1110.0784660746385
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	1288.1125128700462
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	1505.7081917548594
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	5572.176163423978
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	1308.9105553878453
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	2020.930154319633
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	956.4893170031637
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	1351.4390952960541
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	2069.4394294485173
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	2527.9157709841215
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	1220.2318399545634
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	1173.5535579242667
— Am I right, skipper?	473.18294308383963
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	924.0975298756795
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	1959.6416282372882
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	801.1956159983617
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	1279.860105124353
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	1233.2330968692452
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	1450.6101604684477
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	1864.7043748124536
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	1222.7844220509558
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	925.6782365557565
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	734.9071794776972
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	1008.3357365437755
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	919.6458335717064
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	771.2640634480584
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	3212.3745471452394
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	6530.998349104881
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	1622.7478289951553
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	3141.9847392983593
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	357.14749901786695
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	14996.140913431898
And the best jumpers and racers?	1137.636958365132
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	1061.8622548727465
Tell me that.	1432.0869418074014
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	1866.1891142962293
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	1088.3173502963014
The Irish catholic peasant.	3550.7209307419835
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	862.4787625862806
You know Jem Mullins?	2745.7817656798243
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	724.6431546876214
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	1336.6085421241614
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	1324.3352216059407
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	903.0887604696217
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	1008.8426548519097
And now, why?	220.73950504657236
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	734.1363927142527
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	964.215368140694
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	1152.481230025404
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	902.4733913765727
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	1342.5174312437978
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	1772.0977886975497
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	3755.0606293664023
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	1100.1658078240912
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	1120.0613688678382
s.	1279.478060725364
d.	3463.712087416958
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	1054.245876315304
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	1173.18461079811
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	1505.7980623219735
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	1450.2034604393646
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	699.4295291045061
A soft answer turns away wrath.	5361.969293311128
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	847.6505208031732
Am I not right?	367.55856629390314
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	1019.0227283667125
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	2104.5014388637887
— Of course, Mr B.	1068.6552195190354
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	1170.4302540986375
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	1189.8476841092809
But with a little goodwill all round.	1591.0432868921625
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	2167.05145940493
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	3800.389488520365
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	3796.3028942713786
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	3080.0048385952937
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	792.6884396866517
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	2384.55859834699
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	662.3211340523749
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	466.9186105022787
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	8448.699428940092
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	690.4767243092268
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	2911.1592944466843
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	977.1492821437081
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	1676.690194280412
Why?	190.44911106412906
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	2414.0135717912535
They are practical and are proved to be so.	1266.815949443382
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	845.7658230500758
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	1996.5211149291251
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	726.6150366732294
Turks.	13137.782459902772
It ’ s in the dogma.	738.291150136953
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	951.1986981794114
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	886.2926201261494
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	1362.2590245239132
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	938.784154523948
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	672.9665028997839
I call that patriotism.	2415.5619911941367
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	3156.5200874033276
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	679.0447442691939
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	1445.6932473107524
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	1239.753195646902
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	459.6257572146391
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	1281.5759455741966
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	1285.576233949764
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	751.8502456862094
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	768.2949792300968
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	1544.2985465673037
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	5290.064714873504
That ’ s work too.	956.9733138392406
Important work.	14938.837445611834
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	754.8978961669503
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	1289.5111650584802
What?	122.71942533465327
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	887.3102679919361
Each is equally important.	1488.9337660225217
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	1043.3709234348921
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	1165.9228224975498
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	657.0479474479745
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	1651.377995208807
Excuse me.	2944.5932046792573
What was it you...?	2776.319265905847
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	1230.1755628951717
Let us change the subject.	2022.646338682823
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	1062.0706392651987
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	1801.1233513501777
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	1456.2452882761672
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	1296.605902334877
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	1359.1965572769495
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	1169.7219009428
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	1467.9484865550623
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	971.0280984920357
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	1169.3637866969132
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	754.10853186264
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	2194.3586385588965
With brains, sir.	1561.2633563317938
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	837.9252920472283
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	4563.318059664614
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	846.5427551754423
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	884.1058800690444
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	3773.315810596926
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	1200.674650046964

— There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	375.2654580666081

Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses.	847.6832607763173
Dead he wasn ’ t.	1356.2275028088586
Simply absconded somewhere.	24014.371908638477
The coffin they brought over was full of stones.	1250.7548279146465
He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	1487.373807878982
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	1042.267704250759
And so forth and so on.	826.814193600546
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	1120.3154773791216
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	1098.9476108271394
Something evidently riled them in his death.	2677.948535678013
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	2291.3826488180775
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	2027.3787159755782
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	1329.705762938478
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	1234.7802490532333
And the identical same with murderers.	810.5722966257977
You had to come back.	985.8228965907597
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	2508.065324319165
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	2075.274138236584
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	993.9806456910765
Still as regards return.	3632.181422223342
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	1113.7035222558923
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	1452.9191726383312
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	877.7483879123182
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	564.9306531672215
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	1231.593728135875
She put the first nail in his coffin.	970.1629875261211
— Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi - disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	1101.9185354668925
She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	1580.5566130248544
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	783.8745424351005
The husband was a captain or an officer.	1267.4164183568212
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	1043.70515253461
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	5070.491988316486
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	1135.1132919841089
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	1563.005956780807
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	878.25851592394
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	609.9484702842921
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	714.2103779659137
Poser.	21558.06072352106
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	1247.1929245585427
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	1219.9770271837992
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	1072.2137131108545
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	890.0421952034245
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	751.9092325950654
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	1100.9267426173521
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	427.41603233458324
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	875.7891562927348
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	1195.5635750799509
— Was she?	253.11791242398482
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	1219.8584492893651
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	934.7133555895219
So, Spain.	1639.7145176343915
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	853.8352663937324
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	505.2937434657381
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	843.7442917280324
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	760.5976865457361
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	2228.532900083535
Taken a few years since.	3917.315455628035
In or about ninety six.	3322.5860554889255
Very like her then.	1503.0010496819784
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	1242.3478112963066
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	612.9084391538314
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	914.1864096249977
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	953.4004758862613
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	420.2012521890679
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	3996.4520539023133
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	1506.7639388775424
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	732.6095114993589
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	2602.172334637663
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	836.9296691897374
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	965.6944756025139
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	1981.862639432299
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	1203.7744544082923
Suppose she was gone when he?	393.61103130491165
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	1720.085367331732
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	773.6563264631793
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	759.3508537248068
And why not?	304.39958325763035
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	1738.3270110850099
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	777.3047078557286
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	1343.2533339448796
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	1337.178596554424
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	974.4451958427835
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	618.7041248882405
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	1068.518181059823
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	995.0503714707037
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	1492.5804485061642
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	1580.146194483994
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	1847.7838359115212
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	2038.9511533098455
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	960.2247830057039
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	2375.6053890604167
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	987.2238802034584
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	2210.1654887945883
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	4873.736323296313
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	788.485592772051
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	1962.1506630693423
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	1118.16716648648
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	795.1880296852682
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	804.3244253902491
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	686.9851132312959
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	1718.7480312170496
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	809.3984291218571
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	1173.028341925783
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	1732.1958487683041
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	1894.468912995746
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	1827.321855813067
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	1573.6073810708435
Your god was a jew.	1885.3766495418852
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	2995.005310113913
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	1897.4951364161711
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	2650.623685687712
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	1242.1080912116522
Do you like cocoa?	472.51099360706434
Wait.	4301.167531310137
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	1358.1205039899728
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	1064.8529304483018
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	584.152923371848
An opening was all was wanted.	1552.2087113709727
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	651.424637873254
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	1339.758910789529
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	1673.9518329924108
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	4369.077833407778
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	1223.889219378003
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	2048.6708371768477
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	1691.253664954428
— Are you bad in the eyes?	244.9523770571462
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	1415.0394067389866
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	1144.2463590853283
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	2235.569462694781
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	680.4123890732164
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	1843.8264909710615
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	995.8653707707074
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	1424.9231260627337
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	2230.239334294068
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	769.6107930982587
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	563.3578856745662
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	1546.5998110755656
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	1389.993282573635
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	579.9948618816123
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	1015.1201794716694
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	402.7486201971039
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	786.187059808155
Come.	3769.4841282972616
It ’ s not far.	834.7880409797226
Lean on me.	2713.4959830941916
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	897.2640024814228
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	771.364522266822
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	548.0472873453195
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	610.9569272373598
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	1340.6882695456322
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	1086.3194277391967
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	1224.027015156228
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	1638.0150379143795
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	1174.7621807287658
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	911.4245065867284
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	1541.1623912092462
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	652.9253752919094
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	1944.5257434752884
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	1716.170130581975
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	1472.9596307608474
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	793.8350397254305
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	1185.0457295537726
Beware of the steamroller.	2240.741436429953
They thereupon stopped.	10164.980560301929
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	1094.0669868022578
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	1039.4440090140974
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	561.7148693723386
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	965.0307046569527
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	2305.985794722411
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	1492.4326239835527
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	1358.6675430250264
— What ’ s this I was saying?	218.14774973081023
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	1435.7872894030038
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	1148.8691644852813
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	1121.9387889415962
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	5702.181776309388
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	4524.014112541762
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	3275.4429094194575
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	624.044606419543
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	1490.778986678004
A.	2028.0615964047747
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	1225.4533483192797
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	1576.9526780805709
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	1736.8050770526745
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	1406.5210670292397
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	2246.7670243368216
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	853.8008574081739
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	1489.9156845911832
The horse was just then.	1288.698159698561
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	1429.440318756909
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	1462.4353940887083
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	1803.6389632640544
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	1453.732498863738
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	762.4802856901418
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	99407.03630443236
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	951.3550248097388
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	1122.6823632358157
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	954.5437645662025
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	1113.7667685458766
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	1928.200233673436
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	2805.0605831570588
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	924.4989650600027
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	3266.172868985252
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	2728.953852712903
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	1924.2678398847631
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	7924.316963192831
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	11414.845232103684
Were their views on some points divergent?	1565.7427872628555
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	1066.6935248965733
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	2099.1277670941686
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	1914.4590797260566
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	522.681381483264
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	2636.7717343970758
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	2374.2047538649617
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	1982.328198450838
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	1457.6481555619755
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	2817.1928956103466
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	1177.0047305560229
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	406.7934328519513
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	696.0084880330588
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	1923.7858643779298
As in what ways?	414.000203795779
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	978.8030359566937
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	1237.1807177907835
Was it there?	271.94446028337666
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	532.9591363477936
Why was he doubly irritated?	1423.1439736052932
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	1001.626435169981
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	986.4235904323456
To enter or not to enter.	1660.829143357027
To knock or not to knock.	1570.1343447075596
Bloom ’ s decision?	348.5149800413125
A stratagem.	8500.371147137086
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	1025.2515372257405
Did he fall?	389.5475145777357
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	1522.0868885798054
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	2253.712491941167
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	692.700447092217
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	1346.9493593733562
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	1345.074259719766
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	3050.478864300996
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	3905.434027312138
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	688.1281241182612
Did Stephen obey his sign?	958.5303578717545
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	848.0524275953335
What did Bloom do?	309.3240229840813
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	1546.2521268405367
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	1509.314833195481
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	766.3473123163589
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	514.9704642832442
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	3884.525660630621
What did Bloom see on the range?	328.320946677557
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	1092.6256390814933
What did Bloom do at the range?	349.0834404374745
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	650.9448841178933
Yes.	2997.8126705455184
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	2228.159129756071
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	1162.7536867682707
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	377.59938416808825
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	3217.040597851963
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	932.6915083919404
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	2073.3510248891025
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	881.6318929868575
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	1642.8251257506734
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	887.1996479534225
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	4135.070915634812
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	4711.950943505283
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	1109.2382262342044
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	803.0529845241331
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	2413.9034989778497
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	866.5731044081265
The phenomenon of ebullition.	3362.277453314786
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	4310.34341829025
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	1356.3269703594308
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	1016.2067948356431
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	4568.3927907596535
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	1008.0892441096375
To shave himself.	3620.7396972806077
What advantages attended shaving by night?	595.6747928052675
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	1658.945664489223
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	1230.0143776073614
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	796.983645472158
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	573.9375750206038
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	1766.7631127764394
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	560.3055684233827
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	2956.917946862427
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	3250.2084375932377
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	308.4127542605336
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	3404.0703840413867
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	2572.283602609386
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	1073.321774239544
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	726.3212658984597
In Bernard Kiernan ’ s licensed premises <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street: in David Byrne ’ s licensed premises, <NUM> Duke street: in O ’ Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon ’ s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	837.0902843789995
W.	4990.896473038367
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	2159.763210117919
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	916.0355130708973
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	5323.6846691292085
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	3325.002692931637
His mood?	86.01978997080491
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	725.4334781082631
What satisfied him?	349.21404716525166
To have sustained no positive loss.	4639.324641149054
Light to the gentiles.	1938.114199916749
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	1293.1224483912758
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	1073.1991103573964
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	851.2353120747969
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	950.9569350791512
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	541.7044328043257
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	1568.5151998500305
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	638.8475264451356
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	794.4503359261332
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	687.4661540712794
Who drank more quickly?	829.2788805602347
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	845.7320822987699
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	3039.9649406013145
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	1117.5803609826555
Had he found their solution?	705.1377006846494
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	999.9896736054098
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	641.924996925343
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you ’ ll find room.	1595.2822222940038
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	1511.6807825042604
Bloom.	1994.4318862221655
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	1497.169788992438
Name, age, race, creed.	681.7848457222101
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	597.6193455216097

P.	4260.019879117364
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the <NUM> February <NUM>?	788.6826130963574
Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	7686.876549717984
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	4433.924537973337
Dearer far than song or wine.	5334.484078537781
You are mine.	2360.2452852158945
The world is mine.	1607.069505631771
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	2895.6198872585514
G.	5827.72223398114
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	796.0818463394061
Shelton <NUM> December <NUM>, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.	2746.8021951788696
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?	2878.342980447685
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born <NUM>, acceded <NUM>) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist ’ s non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist ’ s revelations of white articles of non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody ’ s Book of Jokes_ (<NUM> pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	1856.22871903393
What relation existed between their ages?	710.8459111214762
<NUM> years before in <NUM> when Bloom was of Stephen ’ s present age Stephen was <NUM>.	585.0798946069606
<NUM> years after in <NUM> when Stephen would be of Bloom ’ s present age Bloom would be <NUM>.	638.6791539001345
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	1047.3281969162488
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	4931.955564342853
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	538.2302028551601
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin ’ s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s father and Stephen ’ s granduncle, Stephen being then <NUM> years older.	655.2369561265898
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	1006.0514514652572
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	1959.722435132073
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	1093.5013330844374
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	915.9115169442933
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	1220.6256279732922
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	2307.6948435872982
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	524.5347128393291
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	1400.8382742387885
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	719.3004550584958
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	1923.831767180165
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	1809.617500728892
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	1552.4999985421682
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	1812.3423105047696
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	2113.395178166757
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	4126.912305432852
Neither.	13137.782459902772
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen?	556.0635991450416
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	475.25307991305226

C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	1081.9883248913065
Did they find their educational careers similar?	2274.932645859882
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame ’ s school and the high school.	1543.443448002828
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	1372.0015779531166
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	1098.7966871997448

What two temperaments did they individually represent?	2793.8327157325393
The scientific.	5102.218821642528
The artistic.	2713.1573833873167
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	904.9462407751444
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	1962.736562676623
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	4528.4862219008455
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	3479.9503434624994

What?	122.71942533465327
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel.	951.6984362514736
Queen ’ s Ho...	8210.02121177025
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	1084.1880381113324
The Queen ’ s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the <NUM> June <NUM>, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of <NUM> parts of aconite liniment to <NUM> of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at <URL> <URL>. on the morning of <NUM> June <NUM> at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, <NUM> Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at <URL> <URL>. on the afternoon of <NUM> June <NUM> a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, <NUM> Main street, Ennis.	900.6966914246229
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	2970.93106718687
Coincidence.	648.4142163114785
He preferred himself to see another ’ s face and listen to another ’ s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	1372.7276567709162
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	1066.4196341873885
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	2406.178375009398
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise <URL> <URL>., sunset <URL> <URL>. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	1918.6124285458725
What to do with our wives.	1104.2049488135963
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	2738.1591477229763
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	2531.0607858556846
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	906.9698810398557
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	1565.202265012647
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	784.9787877594919
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	1952.5421117004978
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	4442.938987212097
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	4130.2263198854935
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	2953.5964047003617
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	877.7584510039931
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	3684.2409791817895
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	2049.4570776587684
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	1550.4388412635155
Variously.	21558.06072352106
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other ’ s ignorant lapse.	1935.580728231425
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	1470.1255555695632
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	1098.1846197143668
What system had proved more effective?	1560.029575255904
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	60244.54551826408
Example?	1160.373267622947
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	686.4610199088335
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest ’ s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	2789.475702959001
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	1170.884269210192
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	813.0349492368907
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	2162.205435408486
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?	1977.115075739288

What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?	1044.6922349161325
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	1960.4975006121172
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m ’ baad l ’ zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	2700.6117711910983
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	1879.533528547156
By juxtaposition.	13777.449669856846
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, and <NUM>.	968.0247788930667
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	1003.3662960175217
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	7965.9209028491805
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	914.8585660739311
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar <NUM> years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	2694.4880642665007
Mary ’ s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve ’ s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	1800.077271797266
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	29135.07495923569
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	454.498420235647
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	2058.2909173378875
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	2768.4661692223212
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	2313.3078113738625
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	3482.0848111791593
Did the guest comply with his host ’ s request?	744.2371049481712
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	1423.8857103212795
What was Stephen ’ s auditive sensation?	636.0860110791344
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	2081.767334510717
What was Bloom ’ s visual sensation?	518.4976873338841
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	1337.0848873996842
What were Stephen ’ s and Bloom ’ s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	877.8190643574801
Visually, Stephen ’ s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	3773.808881058402
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	708.9200220984382
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.	1498.2227672347651

C.	3903.316026160732
On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († <NUM>), exponent of Shakespeare.	2764.642536592608
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	1707.8659887868318
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	2446.1251935272435
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	2253.401160201794
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	2318.656515150142
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	1373.006806297928
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew ’ s windows all.	1312.096344960349
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	715.5891116182006
With unmixed feeling.	11372.007291429034
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	1184.3793333339465
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	711.18316251445
Then out there came the jew ’ s daughter And she all dressed in green.	812.1920221707127
“ Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again. ” I can ’ t come back and I won ’ t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	874.912189217027
For if my master he did hear He ’ d make it a sorry ball. ” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	1274.6000026981083
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	1117.9728297878985
And now he ’ ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	982.5505535951111
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	744.7560324125811
With mixed feelings.	5463.276294811185
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew ’ s daughter, all dressed in green.	740.2300932642536
Condense Stephen ’ s commentary.	4625.017930723384
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	474.16417586132934
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	2162.051653573947
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	776.9435730876327
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	1222.0375987628051
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	871.3402458887872
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	677.0770012097273
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	577.8353955930179
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	749.6762518826797
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	820.487867770833
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	1326.8334872934702
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	1672.1269438343643
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	827.4691313093545
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	1113.241878090422
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	1627.6181660842667
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	1177.276353684244
What other infantile memories had he of her?	272.00556977559626
<NUM> June <NUM>.	2089.049855863103
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	8697.832286008132
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	1936.1218611379718
What endemic characteristics were present?	3132.0359376208335
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	1994.8613864093675
What memories had he of her adolescence?	274.7590809471307
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	4323.07746104624

Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	1011.7939793532609
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	2498.0611312801357
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	1657.321793110937
A temporary departure of his cat.	1599.9441793500514
Why similarly, why differently?	1287.7847840025531
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	1453.3026463389947
In other respects were their differences similar?	661.219717365889
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	385.26358272579165
As?	215.79252536286884
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	1531.2050855320015
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	1803.70043938135
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	1342.193497361864
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	522.1585955147041
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	683.1138034411618
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	1559.7583595447982
In what manners did she reciprocate?	1284.200276751964
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	1190.425771295633
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	1941.1549743723444
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	833.800144305098
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	775.8499350003077
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	1648.0686015814354
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	1840.0859466254133
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	2034.3451049182804
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	3982.9674205063334
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	2733.6674406919547
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	843.9673871695804
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	1393.1988560662408

Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	1114.7259902994897
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	1639.0839945429086

The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ <NUM> <NUM>), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	745.1260536802524
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	1496.663438929891
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	1663.0243267437747
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	1402.2597463807103
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, <NUM> Lower Abbey street (W.	1881.5337740447767
and E.	1608.901712301241
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	945.1281018955573
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	3770.878397957244
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	755.0854649318561
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	721.5096097276922
and T.	1666.2697527292855
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	1364.1636646970317
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	352.1897607356538
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	1352.7048363727201
Never.	4697.151586087564
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	1578.1173240093894
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	3136.9434918180605
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	1153.3933006112206
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	2196.164105634156
Why did he desist from speculation?	1600.4519706432975
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	1209.5217528729013
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	1497.7563072341418
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	1538.3555174741336
Not verbally.	10323.505231834632
Substantially.	21558.06072352106
What comforted his misapprehension?	1783.2052983485073
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	1293.3562446286815
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	900.5149380207687
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	7398.5227981807275
What did each do at the door of egress?	226.55892953059907
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	905.0299217518963
Stephen put the hat on his head.	675.2493090178716
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	337.9771487499914
For a cat.	1821.3261952916014
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	614.0839966317171
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	7295.951610781598
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	1507.2508290719256
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	1901.4795049935183
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	4298.0348425171715
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	2552.2873471887283
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	1878.8355580177288
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	746.8183621523284
Of a different order of difficulty.	1743.3668255156358
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	2754.5940708280605
And the problem of possible redemption?	650.4773288085411
The minor was proved by the major.	628.0453419811043
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	798.4947896480007
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	2350.9888567838684
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	1082.7476293666948
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	262.7397754636767
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	900.7781802736173
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	1978.7231378842475
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	812.3978263687951
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	2432.0463898448056
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	2562.3486866149365
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	1607.6454502005804
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	965.4054478024548
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	1740.728685532048
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	391.71935417995235
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	1501.489428449473
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	896.0100288914356
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	2496.5570715373156
Both then were silent?	683.699317596703
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	1849.660287278821
Were they indefinitely inactive?	4039.1063611143645
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	927.8171331417494
Similarly?	1160.373267622947
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	1422.9730535851413
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	1672.7373872926253
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	2050.619071089674
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	2405.4486252716897
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	601.7663039648461
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	3747.0646604180647
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	2100.1131327168323
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	2318.601947972013
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	361.69806582393176
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	1568.0821922111602
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	1099.0626432507986
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	342.8662605617186
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	743.4659110003988
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	4998.920942106099
Turma circumdet.	27324.731655759035
Iubilantium te virginum.	19519.03527693144
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	1614.542288305339
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	326.47511626289526
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	490.9511701717819
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	512.7579450799441
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	1185.5671281942778
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	529.0606534740608
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	3814.286983015628
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	2577.7946489216883
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	2403.4393268532376
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	2516.5521798515833
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	917.123774506022
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	489.6022443857712
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	867.7707667233814
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	574.1501338599285
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	1036.0193377036553
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	1659.5920272691258
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	1979.8461781607916
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	1756.4407088177584
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	425.82124393383896
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	1649.8444952605894
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	1023.2703313890166
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	1624.9323456825707
Describe them.	6680.455959235537
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	1988.0274351861444
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	1388.280935420389
What significances attached to these two chairs?	1527.151833411005
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	1277.685720991883
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	545.8434122986829
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies ’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	1653.7780324902376

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	1354.3592252785168
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	1374.745644070244
His next proceeding?	1296.3246061579866
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	1041.4604466697722
What followed this operation?	1142.7794425956665
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	8915.577425275305
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?	582.8720275039213
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?	1225.6922226858435
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	1885.3636239746986
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	3959.2222935741083
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	1539.716591680261
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	1271.829938628516
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	379.1722014401147
Brothers and sisters had he none.	2190.7248410471593
Yet that man ’ s father was his grandfather ’ s son.	660.2126944968967
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	1489.4964032874311
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	6534.783620910811
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.	8405.976115822488
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	1015.1631438280584
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.	1568.0512526565738

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.	1236.3250436058854

What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?	943.4250663652225
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown.	3424.0193544089607
Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.	2159.3131767381874

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?	2042.7685308713721
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	1145.517583087901
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.	4624.608435906504
As?	215.79252536286884
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	3313.3540208770933
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	1052.3577046021007
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.	2975.014113477296

Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	1009.8677518965062
Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	2215.1724074582526
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	1731.04276818603

What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	620.4267172080448
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.	10570.472161199748
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	2188.625465026647
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.	1452.8631684915633

With which attendant indignities?	1763.0387246710654
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	2009.4784611838045
By what could such a situation be precluded?	533.3783038665007

Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	1229.2977805832782
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events.	2104.1018247499173
Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall.	3103.640941579543
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.	2522.973123505503
What would render such return irrational?	1679.8657452718508

Bloom ’ s acts?	228.7522568323993
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	780.02381182912
How?	176.91223264362307
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	1056.689113246267
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	745.1601709520833
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	922.3170424299533
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	604.0141549761873
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	1209.7620937024196
What preceding series?	778.3569093389038
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	1174.852448336063
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	781.135464650845
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	1815.886434765776
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	2064.9589562647616
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	1179.452919520989
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	3704.076736571592
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	2760.121525578658
Envy?	849.7949504514035
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	1511.3867770731545
Jealousy?	1160.373267622947
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	1498.2442698744717
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	2024.2631721573416
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	1433.1672197917799
Abnegation?	1160.373267622947
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	2564.8358945602013
Equanimity?	1160.373267622947
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	1424.502793669574
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	1473.6131421028979
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	2683.2153767763484
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	1805.0027606891979
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	1549.7692339065693
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	2209.333565319478
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	1571.9168596749284
What retribution, if any?	541.898910379523
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	1647.4408840579997

Divorce, not now.	2092.372686970971
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	1754.3065568889563
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	3885.6508214220885
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	4090.6845712025647
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	2508.5342871122366
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	1079.0962730768695
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	2417.6220284905767
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	2125.860911170749
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	1533.4166160011343
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	1162.9255145117495
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	3611.6656380725713
Then?	175.37773131171784
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	4602.43014291478
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	1162.9255145117495
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	3162.012694030116
What followed this silent action?	929.7210544126065
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.	13574.44891976005

By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, <NUM> September <NUM>, there remained a period of <NUM> months and <NUM> day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	1427.9520549175247
How?	176.91223264362307

• Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of

me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits

hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from

damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes

loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were <NUM> of us goodbye to my sleep for this

wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that

the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only <NUM> or <NUM> Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM> st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day

couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	1052.7069093844887
