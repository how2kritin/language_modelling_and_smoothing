1299.9959854074427
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	1098.9074451403085
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	382.7519743115202
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	640.3088370669153
You saved men from drowning.	767.3264573184309
The scrotumtightening sea.	748.0908994655397
There is something sinister in you....	148.61417687004936
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	1964.73328906581
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	1666.1845654012916
Buck Mulligan answered.	372.7848886754815
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	612.6823294779883
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	579.0303479066373
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	667.3629595012582
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	620.3463790657343
A servant too.	301.93612847891825
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	529.5989820852301
he said.	50.91883309542916
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	878.7025908412292
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	484.62497859900947
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	369.30779950690896
What did you say that for?	236.08757160269226
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	1024.7490375120335
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	427.46473121283606
Brief exposure.	2201.090847445073
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	1794.0351369870348
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	446.27232440919477
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	660.8999199357986
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	427.9298785925684
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	360.8266349638136
— Go on then, Talbot.	263.62020031019614
My father gave me seeds to sow.	991.9441636528063
Ask me, sir.	211.54992075327198
— Again, sir.	184.0872909069714
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	335.38715053819715
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	1001.023658885038
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	638.3303322769179
Mr Deasy is calling you.	357.597701386554
— What is it now?	182.63054536457165
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	614.4088772040247
Money is power.	537.6207369332416
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	725.4360646738613
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	483.6050487866635
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	944.4660288379457
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	451.1690488149485
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	1849.094732760432
Serum and virus.	1619.0773830208514
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	540.0587242520426
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	1622.5525940301134
I am, a stride at a time.	196.62052204828612
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	592.5573821891456
Yes, I must.	109.93580508686351
Lump of love.	464.58252446332665
It lowers.	708.1557303167364
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	478.4394762348128
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	722.7866470223676
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	4061.998546290348
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	426.65028124505716
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	3087.928937060439
_Fermé_.	607.9556556347198
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	389.8580664197195
She serves me at his beck.	690.8676295872631
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	1168.8538135078638
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	1903.5690109453246
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	491.79935351782547
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	568.0537674504055
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	423.54425254262964
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	829.2841108947287
Open hallway.	792.2926540101219
In. Come.	109.28709050448543
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	3331.912132318947
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	608.5436809279613
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	728.5397197436378
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	810.846067727471
Welcome as the flowers in May.	587.0918554811168
My ashplant will float away.	1048.6135126768722
I shall wait.	240.98020927310267
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	376.1718466408083
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	1218.9671956042089
The coals were reddening.	1005.1816404266782
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	278.27078117738927
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	555.3654167443559
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	1616.0568960554442
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	721.3758719816987
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	911.0109463507481
Not there.	137.14775406653263
Makes you feel young.	512.6416628513997
Getting on to sundown.	658.4514603308306
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	900.2268981019287
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	894.4448173927686
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	2745.416846037242
For you, please?	247.26419734062193
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	807.6975022141127
Still an idea behind it.	384.4154029541001
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	415.6256625255557
Yes, yes.	108.73883273127261
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	1654.2023899929336
Here.	103.77932914467516
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	1838.9814204310999
Only five she was then.	330.33041719092085
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	246.07303207738317
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	485.152979732151
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	461.3057246190515
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	1261.9031073861452
C.	96.23846299732125
— Here, she said.	118.65527415600793
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	192.27414908022715
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	857.895929204781
Illustration.	607.9556556347198
An example?	652.237183391402
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	316.0997624946868
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	449.88848041356056
Byby.	286.319300185858
Of course it might.	311.7181352167179
Vain: very.	374.57140537560343
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	745.0718760340823
Useless: can ’ t move.	461.53721061133314
Virginia creepers.	2435.907444485323
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	1153.7323789315549
Nobody.	241.4910504830898
Invent a story for some proverb.	1322.9017522175407
<URL>.	64.45240478598026
Her head dancing.	458.24478389056424
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	614.2458020897527
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	557.5290358193793
Singing with his eyes shut.	469.52661257769154
In the dark.	114.7201369952654
No - one.	184.4742532433252
Eyes front.	540.2660716351594

I see you ’ re...	83.40866652572058
Having a wet.	397.44760814991497
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	631.6889748308821
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	293.8635474046915
Like to see her again in that.	179.28720540458545
Rachel, is it?	281.89330904559296
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	497.63453506817126
Ruins and tenements.	1283.745959406372
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	2417.722485499027
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	838.3005068563751

Perfectly right that is.	324.50617799226393
Palestrina for example too.	884.7702837252704
Eunuch.	327.7537808406544
Look down at her ring to find an excuse.	603.4567693551148

Aq. Dist.	1274.4983859619988
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	2367.1587552784495
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	167.26712765654506
How much are they?	374.91747908555453
To look younger.	509.63747800827525
Regular hotbed of it lately.	1352.589585137749
College sports today I see.	748.5116302204057
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	876.4530571860273
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	2845.256925001922
He was alone.	145.62290640202906
Great card he was.	285.8083665235405
His name stinks all over Dublin.	671.8468048167921
Mr Power asked.	245.20062280315582
Gasworks.	607.9556556347198
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	2047.5271652772353
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	838.0894244770407
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	256.6504662760781
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	1034.3525226129095
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	230.05651840963873
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	200.05078070023563
What causes that?	419.3149194848265
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	2921.625792122725
And _Madame_.	377.7246395592907
Or the Moira, was it?	255.38300718331635
— About the boatman?	485.76416364742835
Mr Power asked.	245.20062280315582
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	125.3971520401951
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	338.4874970174783
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	654.368364053579
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	232.15418138858706
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	527.7330245508367
Very encouraging.	729.3046545691309
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	637.5398573528086
— What ’ s wrong now?	248.11165819778782
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	441.6724147675372
— Why?	171.52821569529442
Terrible! — First round Dunphy ’ s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	496.158883639849

Ned Lambert says he ’ ll try to get one of the girls into Todd ’ s.	464.85379376184204
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	501.46625288846985
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	919.8077523184104
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	621.9802437019122
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	1062.4545500175886
Eh?	320.48906629443826
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	596.0220794492935
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	156.77523285331955
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	2400.8004840394715

— L, Mr Bloom said.	159.0972417351788
And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	378.6720306744842
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	231.42274664709973
We have time.	183.49925730274708
More interesting if they told you what they were.	550.446297723275

Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	1499.6546528059828
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	2083.4544042038815

This ad, you see.	236.75248320211674

Highclass licensed premises.	2800.9419937287676
NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	4451.893352732127
a voice asked from the castingbox.	371.18068015151516
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	917.3356410727367
How quickly he does that job.	434.7396926879865
Pop in a minute to phone.	781.884074112946
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	949.4975418329124
Bladderbags.	607.9556556347198

_ — That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... _ — O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	1235.5051541943506
No, twenty...	80.3263278568684

It was at the royal university dinner.	490.54907536796776
— I escort a suppliant, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said melodiously.	977.8315022915566
Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now.	1454.1281375498631

That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	443.4120244262816

He looked towards the saloon door.	467.31880032058194
And blind too, poor fellow.	308.5153348635626
Third time.	423.8074732044023
Does that to all.	171.76711633491965
Wire in yet?	950.0634799920222
O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	985.5621653195433
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	1274.0531066610868
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	296.9464191819048
Clock whirred.	1251.3304378412884
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	1542.5986937073735
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	1118.755398068368
I was only vamping, man.	311.8599381298113
His gouty paws plumped chords.	3732.918657587857
What?	116.16450681686501
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: — _When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	3645.3195840436124

Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.	1646.527548581848

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	899.4981028295297
Look at this, says he.	168.64011675192086
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	519.6140160945184
And he started laughing.	372.22378172693294
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	543.5695876054982
says I.	64.35612612969182
The tear is bloody near your eye.	575.396734124639
— _...	31.147225248445544
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	190.8582039167138
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	509.302814044474
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	1415.9312822326447
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	568.8864271089815
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	4322.513336968263
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	3222.1118984090485
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	2603.7032875847476
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	1487.0185390878655
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	887.1782349676512
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	1019.1780142086303
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	175.04299125314336
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	897.6354169473595
True as you ’ re there.	294.55129070199797

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	433.866180056846

— Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	553.0936340680092
It was a knockout clean and clever.	722.9636832482811
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	386.2617772809296
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	574.7302114191291
J.	70.96904591365316
Look at his head.	209.47220754599695
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	172.58241944898572
What?	116.16450681686501
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	712.9491090321709
And J.	119.89919239305688
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	2049.6744718680966
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	1115.02272307015
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	992.7734949826626
— Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	275.48744655309366
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	3471.526571421873
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	688.8160113763937

Firebrands of Europe and they always were.	572.7675530278575
There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	1437.859331483085
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	951.6526950146651
— That covers my case, says Joe.	393.2628405550034
I was born here.	173.95801718994042
— And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	418.5317654355849

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	449.9384745281053
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	885.0217629733594
— Who made those allegations?	1049.0705144225003

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	2349.133421929163
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	655.0915508479009

Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	931.3239624982244
— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	793.2162506797742
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	1205.4690414605107
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	1073.1891692154306
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	1854.8748507453815
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	1400.682877482077
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	1407.3309927979847
The colours were done something lovely.	683.5983369274319
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	1031.5866782713972
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	1074.6639283187246
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	1289.122656284942
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	3776.1409628158794
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	615.841331881687
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	397.76970639507124
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	983.3188500136341
Sister?	410.4116209029532
Cheap too.	368.9391098787261
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	487.0708475800716
And I ’ ll write to you.	171.32578977060274
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	1301.5723676675461
All are.	129.46724656239863
Took off her hat to show her hair.	588.9657429058578
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she ’ s on for it: good evening.	309.5465399056191
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	777.981782018182
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	615.275412520615
Cause of half the trouble.	419.7766699023916
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	419.9008664170456
Fifteen she told me.	395.59408194120573
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	390.1276347716918
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	977.3894078393191
Neat way she carries parcels too.	1797.3036401865766
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	5474.920754086304
Keeps them out of harm ’ s way.	370.41194055838946
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	866.1891404203993
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	1101.2298027613922
Big he and little she.	194.51045136835498

Animals go by that.	486.3117393113113
Ask yourself who is he now.	439.1611586795527

Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	1136.3371139680617
Old Betty ’ s joints are on the rack.	1017.498793426468

Bailey light.	576.3351892634125
No. Wait.	119.4982590738512
All quiet on Howth now.	526.4620827564739
O wait.	166.1864181874582
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	467.71848673911416
Bat probably.	950.8055212138433
Their frugal meal.	2522.6404691612133
Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.	1268.2600154171034

That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	887.1691925677701

Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	629.9725449232685
Might be money.	323.5610514989323
Must come back.	282.6248908321361
What?	116.16450681686501
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	811.4043859662502
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	1030.6157266198593
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	827.5500067827177
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	2133.984563312281
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	781.1552575023296
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	1060.9621444633426
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	1759.2049049037537
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	1002.8414037272012

Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	580.6195133271949
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	4708.047261307246
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.	1467.2669291706648
